[15]THE FUTURE OF AROD

   [16][Alex%2BRodriguez%2BMiami%2Bv%2BFlorida%2BState%2Bw8pzzRNzxLll.jpg]
   Sure, the main reason for [17]Joe Girardi's press conference today was
   to talk about this years Yankee shortcomings.  But Alex Rodriguez was a
   big part of it and something that I'd like to share with all of you.
   [18][Joe-Girardi-001.jpg]
   At the presser today, [19]Girardi said this about Alex:
   "We've got to see where he's physically at, and if he can play the
   field, how many days he can play the field and how many days he needs
   to DH... I don't think really many of us know about him until we
   actually get him into games in spring training... He hasn't played in a
   year. That's not easy to do, to sit out a year... Do we expect him to
   be a player on our team? Absolutely. Do we expect him to play third
   base? Yes. But in fairness I think you have to see where he's at."
   [20][Alex%2BRodriguez%2BNew%2BYork%2BYankees%2Bv%2BTampa%2BBay%2BKtOP61
   dDXhSl.jpg]
   There is no question that a 40 year old with bad hips and who has sat
   out all season is a liability in the field.  Does it mean ARod can come
   back and impress the Yankees and prove to them that he can still do it?
   Sure, but the Yankees don't reallly care if he plays the field.
   [21][Chase%2BHeadley%2BTexas%2BRangers%2Bv%2BNew%2BYork%2BYankees%2B4Sw
   I3FdxlQgl.jpg]
   Sure, it will help them if he plays 3rd, but they know that the bottom
   line is they will need a third baseman. [22]Chase Headley, who I very
   much enjoyed this year makes a helluva lot of sense.  Then on some
   days, use [23]ARod at third, and DH him the majority of the time.  It
   goes back to what I said before... they don't care about ARod and him
   in the field.
   [24][Alex%2BRodriguez%2BNew%2BYork%2BYankees%2Bv%2BChicago%2BtGoScA76nH
   5l.jpg]
   They want his bat.  If he can hit and hit home runs, at least in 2015,
   Yankee brass will feel like they will be getting back on this bum
   investment.  That's my opinion of course... but I think I'm right.
   Carry on...

[39]GARDENHIRE CANNED!

   [40][ron-gardenhire-mlb-minnesota-twins-detroit-tigers1-850x560.jpg]
   Sad news if you're in Minnesota... or maybe not.  Ron Gardenhire, the
   manager of the Minnesota Twins has been fired.  He's been the Twins
   manager since 2002.  He had 8 seasons of winning records, but since
   2010, the team has struggled.  I guess Gardenhire's the reason. Who
   knows.
   According to [41]Hardball Talk: "[42]Gardenhire replaced [43]Tom Kelly
   in 2002 and had immediate success, winning six division titles in nine
   seasons. However, those teams went 6-21 in the playoffs. And now the
   Twins have lost 90 or more games in four consecutive seasons and only
   the Astros have fewer total wins since 2011."
   [44][ron%2Bgard.jpg]
   Hey, frustration has set in with Twins management.  They are clearly
   going in a new direction. Ten bucks says they call Tom Kelly just to
   "check in".
   Good Luck Ron.

[56]VALUING JETER AS A PERSON... NOT JUST A YANKEE

    [57][DEL: # :DEL] ThankYouCaptain via [58][DEL: # :DEL] BYB
   It's a strange feeling for a writer to be left speechless. We spend so
   much of our time being able to so eloquently put into words our
   innermost thoughts and feelings about things, moments... people.
   Feelings that could  keep most completely speechless. Sometimes,
   believe it or not, I feel that way about Derek Jeter... after all, I'm
   a fan too.
   [59][Derek%2BJeter%2BKansas%2BCity%2BRoyals%2Bv%2BNew%2BYork%2BBQy-0hUT
   CMzl.jpg]
   I've thought back recently on the career of [60]Derek Jeter. It is
   littered with so many wonderful moments, it seems nearly impossible to
   pick one that shines above all others. I think it is the collection of
   all these moments that make Jeter the icon we see him as. Two moments
   have been coming back to me more and more. Moments that are so
   minuscule, they may only be important to me.
   Early in his career, and in a season when I was still too young to care
   too much about what was happening, Jeter struck out. It wasn't
   gracefully, either. It was obvious that he did something wrong by his
   reaction, and by [61]Joe Torre's reaction. Torre, who usually was quite
   stone faced, was obviously annoyed by his young shortstop.
   [62][alg-jeter-torre-jpg.jpg]
   When Jeter made it to the dugout, where other players would pitch fits
   by themselves over their mistakes, Jeter sat next to Torre, and
   welcomed the reprimand. He took in what Torre told him, and made the
   adjustments he needed to make. He didn't expect to be forgiven, or for
   his mistake to be overlooked. He took the criticism, and worked to
   change.
   [63][02.derek-jeter.jpg]
   Everything since that moment has been a result of hard work.  Jeter has
   literally put blood, sweat and tears into his career. Never satisfied
   with settling. The wins and losses were always part of the bigger
   picture. His ultimate goal was always the World Series.
   The second moment was more recently. A couple of years ago, I had the
   opportunity to sit behind the Yankees dugout. I was in awe, to say the
   least. But the thing that stayed with me the most was Jeter's presence
   on the field. When it came time for the team to get out there, he
   didn't yell "GO."
   [64][Derek%2BJeter%2BBoston%2BRed%2BSox%2Bv%2BNew%2BYork%2BYankees%2BBX
   15wKuaeIjl.jpg]
   He became the complete embodiment of a leader and said "Let's Go,"
   being the first one out onto the field every time!
   We live in a society where many have such a sense of entitlement, it's
   a little bit disheartening. It seems like the people who value hard
   work, and leadership are few and far in-between. Jeter has always been
   an incredible example of both those things. It's really simple for a
   guy like Jeter to coast. He's gained the popularity, and respect. Why
   not allow others to do for him?
   [65][dj_3000.jpg]
   Because that isn't who Jeter is! He's a running full on down the first
   baseline to beat the out kind of guy. He's an emerging from the tunnel
   first to set an example kind of guy. He's a dive into the stands, flip
   play home plate making, 3,000th hit record setting kind of guy.
   Maybe my admiration for handwork, dedication and leadership is why I
   adore Jeter, or maybe it's because of Jeter that I value those things.
   I'm not entirely certain, and that is completely acceptable.
   But I do know that Jeter is all the things I value. Not in the Yankee,
   but in the person.

[81]GIRARDI PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY!

   [82][175646422.jpg]
   [83]Joe Girardi will hold his post season press conference today at
   noon.
   According to YES Network, "After YES airs the live simulcast of The
   Michael Kay Show (3 pm -7 pm) later that afternoon, at 7:00 pm it will
   premiere Yankees Classics: [84]Derek Jeter’s Final Home Game, the game
   from last Thursday.
   [85][Derek%2BJeter%2BBaltimore%2BOrioles%2Bv%2BNew%2BYork%2BYankees%2BP
   txKCEVdfTrl.jpg]
   In addition to the game, the Yankees Classic will include extensive
   post-game coverage, including Jeter’s podium press conference and
   clubhouse reaction."
   [86][ap-joe-girardi-dejectedjpg-4db0018ec9cf20d9_large.jpg]
   I can't wait to see what Joe Girardi says. No doubt he'll address the
   Jeter retirement as well as the Yankees not making the playoffs.  It's
   gonna be interesting. If you can get to a TV, try too... it's going to
   be good I'm sure.

[99]DON'T BE SAD. BE GLAD WE WERE THERE

   [100][Derek%2BJeter%2BNew%2BYork%2BYankees%2Bv%2BBoston%2BRed%2B6qV4rB0
   XBQEl.jpg]
   There is never an easy way to say goodbye, but it happened today in
   Fenway Park.  And, I'm happy to say, that as a Yankee fan, there was
   nothing that made me more proud as a Yankee fan, than to share it with
   Red Sox Nation.  I know, it sounds corny and ridiculous and yet, it was
   the perfect place for the send off of Derek Jeter.
   [101][Derek%2BJeter%2BNew%2BYork%2BYankees%2Bv%2BBoston%2BRed%2Bl5lNCam
   qp6kl.jpg]
   I don't know. Maybe it was the 9-5 win.  Maybe it was just the fact
   that the Red Sox fans respected[102] Derek Jeter the past 3 days.  Who
   knows what it was. The reality is, while the rivalry is still there...
   that didn't matter this weekend.  Instead, the happiness surrounding
   Jeter resonated with everyone.  It was absolutely amazing. As a Yankee
   fan, you can't thank the Red Sox fans enough.  You are fans like us and
   it was never more clearer than today.
   I don't want to do a full blown recap today, other than to let you know
   that the Yankees won.  Here's the reality; The win doesn't matter. The
   day as a whole DOES.
   Boston's best gave Jeter his final send-off and plenty in the crowd
   that were Yankee fans too.  It was great to see.
   [103][mothers%2Blove.png]
   Seeing Mrs. Jeter for a moment at Fenway brought it full circle.
   Someone tweeted this photo today and wrote "A mother's love is
   priceless." Nailed it.  It was right then that I lost it.  We have
   expressed at BYB just how wonderful family is and can be, and when it's
   a family like Derek's, with the teaching of determination, hard work,
   pride, professionalism, well it's no wonder our guy Derek succeeded as
   much as he has his entire career.
   BYB writer Suzie Pinstripes was there today, and tweeted this:

     That's a wrap! [104]#FarewellCaptain [105]@dRunner26_2
     [106]@BleednYankeeBlu [107]pic.twitter.com/ia3IZyLzXH
     — Suzanne (@suzieprof) [108]September 28, 2014

   She'll have an in depth piece about her experience at Fenway, as well
   as the reaction to the Captain. I can't wait to see it.
   [109][Derek%2BJeter%2BNew%2BYork%2BYankees%2Bv%2BBoston%2BRed%2BhFN4OEQ
   wgUol.jpg]
   As [110]Bryan Hoch had it today: "Jeter's season-long goodbye ended in
   fitting fashion on Sunday afternoon, running hard down the first-base
   line to notch the 3,465th hit of his career. He signaled for a
   pinch-runner and waved his batting helmet as he left the field, exiting
   a game that the Yankees went on to win, 9-5.
   'I felt like the time was right,' Jeter said. 'My emotions were so all
   over the place on Thursday in New York. When I got here, I was ready. I
   was ready for my career to be over with. I'm happy I had an opportunity
   to come and play here in a couple games, but I'm ready for this to be
   the end.'"
   That quote is very significant.  We've seen big time players hang it up
   only to come back soon after and fade out worse than they did the first
   time. Brett Favre comes to mind.  Others just need another year or 2
   just to be sure. Andy Pettitte comes to mind. Jeter, always strategic
   with how he presents himself knew it was time. For the critics that ask
   why he announced at the beginning of the season. Well, I loved the
   idea. For him, it was a way to organize his priorities for the season.
   [111][Derek%2BJeter%2BNew%2BYork%2BYankees%2Bv%2BBoston%2BRed%2BZWJTC9K
   uuSql.jpg]
   Could you imagine if we didn't know Jeter was going to retire until
   today? Yankeeland would be devastated.  The more I think about the way
   Jeter handled it, announcing the beginning of the season... he did it
   right.
   And there was a moment today, after [112]Brian McCann came in to pinch
   run for Derek, Derek was crossing the infield and walked up to the
   mound.
   [113][Derek%2BJeter%2BNew%2BYork%2BYankees%2Bv%2BBoston%2BRed%2BqxbAtBs
   rshdl.jpg]
   He stopped and shook [114]Clay Buchholz hand.  Again, according to
   Hoch, Derek said to Clay, 'I know this is kind of odd but I just wanted
   to say I've enjoyed competing against you over the years and good
   luck.' He's a class act.
   [115][Derek%2BJeter%2BBaltimore%2BOrioles%2Bv%2BNew%2BYork%2BYankees%2B
   tN_vXo6qkNFl.jpg]
   BYB has been reflecting on Jeter for the past week.  Many of our
   writers have put together some pretty incredible pieces.  We needed to
   do this, because despite the haters, it's evident, Derek Jeter is
   king.  Derek Jeter is the greatest. It was never for evident than his
   final night in the Bronx... and his final day ever, in Fenway Park in
   Boston today.  To see baseball celebrate this man as much as we
   have...well,  it's emotional.  I was touched by a tweet from my friend
   Danny today:

     [116]@BleednYankeeBlu Somehow I cannot comprehend that I am watching
     Derek Jeter's last game in the major leagues.... [117]#Yankees
     [118]#Re2pect [119]#HOF2020
     — Danny O Brion (@DannyOBrion) [120]September 28, 2014

   That's about explains it.  It's gonna be hard to not see Jeter out
   there at shortstop next year for the New York Yankees.  He's been a
   fixture for 20 years.  He's our leader. He's our guy; Homegrown,
   pinstripe pride and always clutch from the start to the end of this
   career.
   [121][jeter-four.jpeg]
   But through all of this, and we've talked about this alot here, it's
   his family structure that brought him to greatness.  Sure, applaud
   Jeter as a man and all that he did with the New York Yankees.  After
   all, he's a terrific ballplayer and an amazing role model.  But here's
   a fact... leaders are created by incredible parents.
   [122][1411581240000-USP-MLB-Kansas-City-Royals-at-New-York-Yankees.jpg]
   Dot and the Doc are extraordinary people, always there to guide Derek.
   They were clearly in his head throughout his life, allowing him to
   lead, helping him to make smart choices and most of all, they offered
   values that allowed the man to blossom into a determined young man,
   with goals, with ambition and with heart in whatever he wanted to
   accomplish in life.  Sure, tip your cap to the Cap... but applaud the
   Jeter parents on this one.  Without them... we may not see this great
   man before us. You know what I mean?
   [123][Derek%2BJeter%2BNew%2BYork%2BYankees%2Bv%2BBoston%2BRed%2B5qL3KkZ
   MyHgl.jpg]
   Finally, let me say this.  Today was hard.  Many cried and millions
   were sad seeing this man hang in up.  But it's not goodbye.  The
   greatest part about Derek Jeter, [124]Jorge Posada, [125]Andy Pettitte,
   [126]Mariano Rivera and [127]Bernie Williams is they're Yankees for
   life.  They'll always be there. Old Timers Day. Any Yankee celebrations
   we have at the Stadium. Hell, maybe one day Derek Jeter will own the
   Yankees.  The point is, while it's "So Long", it's not "Goodbye".
   Luckily for us... Jeter and the boys will always be there.
   And remember something ladies and gentlemen.  You're sad... and you
   can't help it... but don't be sad because it's over. Be glad that you
   witnessed greatness.  It's a privilege, a thrill and I'm emotional, but
   overjoyed to have seen Jeter play all these years.
   [128][2.png]
   Thank you Cap. You did it right... and we'll always remember the good
   times.  Shortstop in Yankee Stadium will never be the same #2, but you
   did us proud, and we'll always love you Cap.
   5 Championships. 3465 hits.  Atta boy kid.

[147]O CAPTAIN, MY CAPTAIN!

   [148][DEL: # :DEL] ThankYouCaptain via [149][DEL: # :DEL] BYB
   [150][Derek%2BJeter%2BBaltimore%2BOrioles%2Bv%2BNew%2BYork%2BYankees%2B
   Ug-g72kyxs1l.jpg]
   Sunday we say goodbye to El Capitan. And I, for one, am devastated; but
   probably for different reasons than most of you. Look, Derek is an
   amazing ballplayer and based on the current state of professional
   athletes, [151]a role model for kids everywhere. I’m not denying what
   he’s meant to the game, the Yankees, and fans in general but for me
   it’s about something deeper.
   [152][don%2Bmattingly1.jpg]
   As stated in many of my other stories, I grew up idolizing [153]Don
   Mattingly. And throughout most of his career (and my childhood) the
   Yankees were terrible. He was the only bright spot in a rather bleak
   era of Yankees lore. So, I get it.
   [154][don%2Bmattingly%2B2.jpg]
   I get the [155]Derek Jeter-mania. For an entire generation of fans
   Derek Jeter is to them what Don Mattingly was to me. How many kids went
   to Little League and asked for #2? How many girls do you see wearing a
   Jeter shirt? Derek Jeter is all they know. Since 1996, Derek Jeter has
   been the (pretty) face of baseball and the Yankees.
   [156][joreg%2Bposada.jpg]
   For me, once Mattingly retired I gravitated towards [157]Paul O’Neill,
   [158]Jorge Posada, [159]Mariano Rivera. Why? Maybe because those guys
   played hard. Maybe because those guys, at the time, weren’t the popular
   choice. Maybe because Jeter has always been a “pretty boy”; an easy
   choice for fans everywhere. But maybe for me, it was just to be
   different. Jeter was the obvious successor to the Yankees chain of
   gloriousness and being an awkward teenager at the time drove me to do
   the opposite of what everyone else was doing.
   [160][frank-thomas.jpg]
   I guess that was my anti-establishment phase. Remember, I always
   took[161] Frank Thomas in the Thomas/[162]Griffey argument.
   [163][Derek%2BJeter%2BBoston%2BRed%2BSox%2Bv%2BNew%2BYork%2BYankees%2B2
   lVhnuj3Uhhl.jpg]
   Flash Forward to 2014, I am a 35-year-old father of 2. All of my heroes
   from childhood are long-since retired and right now, Derek Jeter is the
   lone connection to my younger days and now that he’s retiring; once
   he’s gone so will that connection to those times. Growing old is a part
   of life, a part I’m having a hard time accepting at the moment. Jeter
   was never a personal hero but his retirement will leave me with a sense
   of loss. A sense that time is passing me, all of us, by. Nothing lasts
   forever.
   Wow, it just got dark there for a bit. Sorry about that.
   [164][Derek%2BJeter%2BBaltimore%2BOrioles%2Bv%2BNew%2BYork%2BYankees%2B
   7WPl49huNvOl.jpg]
   To Derek, thank you. Enjoy your retirement, it’s well deserved. You’ve
   always done what’s right and played the game hard. You’ve  been a
   constant for 20 years. We don’t see that much with professional
   athletes these days. While you’re leaving a select few with gift
   baskets, I will be left with a sense of loss and despair. Baseball is a
   child’s game and every child grows up. Now it’s time for me to grow up.
