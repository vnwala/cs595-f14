		<p>hello there people, recently alot of things have changed and life is moving forward</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made a few changes in life to close off connections with certain people and ever since, things have been pretty good. Its for the better that i stay as far away from them as possible.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you are all interested in my life (sarcasm), but this time i just wanted to leave you with some things i&#8217;ve learned.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned that things happen for a reason and that i need to put, like, my happiness before anyone else&#8217;s. I know that sounds selfish but i mean, its true. If you&#8217;re not happy then why do it?<br />
Be happy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, i love your face</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XOXO- that optomistic friend</p>

		<p>hello again old friends</p>
<p>Sorry it&#8217;s been so long since i&#8217;ve been here. I&#8217;ve just been distracted with other things, other people&#8230;&#8230;other problems.</p>
<p>Well to keep you all informed, i was recently in a relationship that i ended sunday night. That is right ladies and gentleman that read this. i ended this interconnection of us two.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what it is about me and these guys that are complete assholes and crazy. Even though I&#8217;m the one who broke it off, I&#8217;m kinda sad. Its not that i don&#8217;t feel bad for the other person, its just like, come on bro i was a part of this too. I will say though, the guy took it harder than i did. I still have learning to do on how this relationship stuff works cause obviously I&#8217;m doing something wrong. Besides, experience is the best teacher (wink wink)</p>
<p><strong>i was happy. i just need to not rely on other people for my happiness anymore. </strong></p>
<p><strong>One door closes, another one opens.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>How was your day? i would love to know. Hopefully it was better than mine.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anyways thank you for reading,stay awesome, i love your face.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>XOXO </strong></p>

		<p>Hello there readers of the internet. Sorry for not posting anything yesterday. I didn&#8217;t really get anything done yesterday either. I had a rest day that was much needed and it was amaaaaazing. Before yesterday my whole week I was feeling depressed and tired for no reason. So yesterday was much needed.</p>
<p>So I never realized how expensive it is being a senior. Today when I was looking at the order form for graduation, I was freakingggg out. Its happening too fast and its so overwhelming. But its nice. It&#8217;s nice thinking back to the end of freshman year and going to graduation for band and having those &#8220;almost&#8221; tears and the same thing happening up until this past year. Its just a lot and yeahh</p>
<p>*sigh* graduation</p>
<p>Anyways, how are you doing? I would love to know!</p>
<p><em>Stay awesome</em></p>
<p>Love ya face</p>

		<p>Its hard to think how much one person can change in 1 year. This time last year was so hard for me. Battling an eating disorder and drama in school. I was a mess. Everyday was a battle. Even though I&#8217;m still trying to recover from one of those, I have changed for the better. I am a different person than last year. And yes, I had/have an ED. I&#8217;m not proud of it, nor do i want to glamorize it, but, I&#8217;m ok now saying it and trying to deal with it. I&#8217;m not going to give anymore details about it, but I am getting better.   Anywaaaaaays, all I&#8217;m saying is change is good. Have a good night people of the internet.</p>
<p>How was your day?</p>

		<p>Today was probably the worst day ever. I couldn&#8217;t even function after what happened. I think I&#8217;m just happy that this person is finally out of my life, like for good. Ugh, if I were to ever see this person i would probably slap them repeatedly and uncontrollably. He literally told me to f*** off and that I&#8217;m stupid and other mean stuff that isn&#8217;t worth repeating. I seriously regret talking to him and dating him and being friends after breaking up and yeah. He is just SUCH a mean person.</p>
<p>So what I wanted time to myself? I&#8217;m supposed to tell you that? I think that if I never met this guy, I would have a much simpler life. This person caused me so much pain for so long, I just wish he knew how it felt. Its like he doesn&#8217;t even care. But whatever. I&#8217;ve wasted too many tears on this person and I&#8217;m not gonna sit and cry about it anymore.</p>
<p>Sorry that I&#8217;m going on this huge rant about my day. It was just such an awful day. On the bright side though, I have to deal with this guy anymore. He&#8217;s probably tired of me too, sooo yeah.</p>
<p>Anyways, <strong>how was your day?  I seriously would love to know how you&#8217;re doing today (:</strong></p>

		<p>Recently I&#8217;ve made some modifications to my image.. For the better of course. I finally feel as if I&#8217;m a beautiful individual, and if I feel like that on the inside, why not show people how I feel? I want to gain the self confidence that I&#8217;ve always wanted, but been too insecure to actually get. I know that there are waaaayyyy more attractive people than me, but now, I just started caring less about what people think and I think I might be getting off topic but whatever.  I&#8217;m not saying I&#8217;m changing. I&#8217;m still the same person, but with a bit more confidence (:</p>
