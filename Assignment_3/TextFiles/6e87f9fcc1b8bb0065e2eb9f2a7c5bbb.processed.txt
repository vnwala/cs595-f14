   If you haven't figured already, I'm Sherlock MAD!
   And after uploading [15]my first Youtube video just under 3 weeks ago,
   I thought, why not? Why not upload a few more Youtube videos here and
   there?
   Hence, the new and improved BBC Sherlock Tag was born!
   [EMBED]
   I tagged a few people to get the ball rolling but if you fancy doing
   the tag yourself, here are the questions for you:
   1. Spell Your Name with Sherlock characters or related words.
   2. Name your favourite Sherlock moment to date.
   3. The character you are most like.
   4. If Sherlock characters had a ordinary jobs
   5. Your best impression of a character.
   6. If you were a murder case for Sherlock, how would it be done?
   7. Describe Mofftiss in one word.
   8. Draw your favourite ship.
   9. Your craziest predictions for the next series.
   10. Is the next series of Sherlock out yet?

   The Ice Bucket Challenge had me stumbling all over my words but I DID
   IT!
   [EMBED]
   I decided to monotise this video on 14th September and donate all the
   money made from its AdSense to the MND Association in exactly a year;
   14th September 2015.
   I have also set up a donation page for those who would like to go the
   extra mile and donate to the cause: [25]Donate to MND Association. (The
   MND Association is the UK based charity of the ALS Association which is
   the USA based one.)
   My hope is that I can make more charity videos in the months to come so
   stay tuned!
   Keep smiling and together we have and will make a difference xxx

   World War One Centenary
   The beginning of this week marked 100 years since World War One. A few
   weeks ago, I blogged about my sister performing in a choir
   commemorating the centenary of World War One and the beginning of this
   week was the day that the world stood still to remember.
    From 10pm to 11pm on Monday, people in the UK turned off all their
   lights but one to remember the 17 million of the fallen during World
   War One.
   [EMBED]
   ([35]BBC One News coverage)
   A very beautiful gesture that the Trafford Centre organised in
   salutation was the Million Poppy Cascade. This is where they let
   poppies fall to symbolise those who fell during the World War.
   [EMBED]
   It's times like this when you begin to reflect upon the world you live
   in and are a part of. These soldiers and civilians put their own lives
   on the line for a better world for the future. Can we even start to
   imagine the bravery? It makes you think, would you do the same?
   Are you someone who would sacrifice your own needs for another? And
   when I ask these questions, I don't only mean would you go to war to
   stand for something you believe in but also for the smaller things in
   life. Like when you see someone's car has broken down on the road, do
   you stop and help? Or when someone is teasing somebody else in a way
   that makes them uncomfortable, are you the type of person who would
   step in? Or when you see someone pickpocket someone but they are still
   unaware of it, would you try and stop them?
   I'm no saint and I put my hands up, there have been times where I've
   stand and just watched things unravel. I guess it's the fear that you
   don't want to get involved that wins over the desire to help. But in a
   world where war and violence still exists strongly, not lending a small
   helping hand in everyday life seems petty in comparison.
   There's a saying by Albert Einstein, "Be a voice, not an Echo.".
   Make a stand in one what you believe in, even if you are the only one
   but I think that being an echo is still just as powerful. By being the
   echo, you constantly repeat what you preach, like how nothing should
   stop us from standing up for what we believe in; like how nothing
   should stop us from offering a helping hand.
   If you were in their situation and asked for help, surely you'd hope
   that you would be someone who would.

   WORLD CAT DAY.
   Need I saw more? Pretty sure this was invented so that the cat's can

   Capturing my life in snaps.
   I am by no means a henna/mehndi artiste professional but I do try!
   This is all from years of practice as growing up, I had nobody else to
   do my own mehndi but myself.
   [mehndi+1.jpg]
   My little sister's mehndi with her red and gold polish to match her Eid
   clothes.
   [mehndi+2.jpg]
    My mum hardly ever wants to get her mehndi done and the one occasion
   that she allows me to, the mehndi tube clogs up half way through hence
   the small design!
   [mehndi+3.png]
   And finally, my own hand.
   I'm quite fond of the one-sided style.
   [47][mehndi+4.jpg]
    I think the simpler the design, the more pleasing it is to the eye.
   This is my attempt of following a design I found on t'internet.

[51]Eid, Commonwealth Mubarak & it'Scott to be his Birthday!

   [52]Email This[53]BlogThis![54]Share to Twitter[55]Share to
   Facebook[56]Share to Pinterest
   Eid Mubarak
   The beginning of this week marked Eid-ul-Fitr which is a celebratory
   day at the end of the month of fasting; Ramadan. It's a day full of
   food, prayer, family (not necessarily in that order!) and most
   importantly gratitude.
   [57][Capture+2.JPG]
   The day usually starts of with Eid prayer at the mosque. If not already
   paid prior to Eid, Fitrana (also known as Zakat-ul-Fitr) is paid. This
   is a certain amount of money paid per person per household to the
   mosque. The amount can vary as it is based on how much 2.5kg of wheat
   costs. For example, a few years ago it was £2.50 and this year it's £5
   per person.
   The Fitrana money is then given and used by less fortunate Muslims to
   pay for any needs they may have for Eid. As Eid is a day of celebration
   for all Muslims, irrespective of wealth, therefore it is our duty to
   help others to celebrate it with us. For example, the money could help
   pay for a filling, Eid meal for a family or buy new clothes for them to
   wear.
   After Eid prayers, the family gathers together to eat a banquet of
   food! And funnily enough, it's easy to think that now you can eat
   during the day that someone will have to pin you down to stop, but
   often you fill up quite quickly as your body is still used to the month
   of fasting.
   Though physical presents can be given, money is often gifted from the
   elderly to the young (Eidi).So if you're a young'un with A LOT of elder
   relatives, be ready to collect millions as you run to the corner shop
   to buy yourself some millions!
   [58][Capture.JPG]
   As with anything, the novelty of Eid may start to rub off as you get
   older but either way, it's such a meaningful day where family come
   together, eat food and be merry!
   Commonwealth Games
   The Commonwealth Games in Glasgow ended this week. It just flew by! To
   be honest, I don't feel like I was even given enough time to breathe it
   all in and it's already ended.
   What I do know though, is that England aren't all that bad at sport! ;)

   The Andrew Scott Birthday Project
   Last but most definitely not least, my friend who runs
   [63]@andrwscttonline on Twitter launched the Andrew Scott Birthday
   project today.
   Similar to what they did last year, Scotties are collectively making a
   birthday video to wish Andrew a Happy Birthday (which, might I add, he
   replied to in his own little video!).
   [EMBED]
   [64][tumblr_n9qncmwPbx1sy1nmro1_500.png] Furthermore, similar to what
   was done for the Batch's Birthday, fans are raising money by donating
   to a charity. The charity for the Scott Project is Shaped Arts who
   supports the disabled within the arts and cultures sector. [65]You can
   get involved and donate here.
   Last time [66]@andrwscttonline did a gift donation for Scott, it was
   earlier this year for Montage Theatre Arts who provide performing arts
   support for low-income families within their community. It managed to
   raise just over £700 and Andrew himself said that he would donate the
   matched amount from his fans to the charity which meant double the
   donation which is awesome!
   Coincidentally, his birthday (October 21st) falls on the same date as
   my long-term, friend since childhood, friend of all friends' birthday!
   This is the friend who insisted I watched Sherlock last year just
   before Series 3 was announced hence introducing me to Andrew Scott!
   Been a fan ever since!
   To get more information and get involved: [67]Andrew Scott Birthday
   Project
   That's all le updates from me for the week!

   [78][tumblr_mg85691t421qzgltlo2_500.gif]
   So it was the Batch's birthday last week but as my Weekly Thought
   Catcher post last week was all about my Graduation, there was no room
   for the Batch apart from Cumberbatch the Cardboard Cut Out! ([79]Read
   more about it here!)
   You may wonder why I'm bothered that it was Cumberbatch's birthday, and
   though it was very hard to ignore with #HappyBirthdayBenedictCumbebatch
   trending on Twitter and my whole timeline being full with nothing but
   Birthday Batch, it was what the Cumbercookies did collectively that I
   want to congratulate.
   There were many charitable initiatives that the Cumberbatch fans
   launched in celebration of Birthday Batch. From a Batch of Kindness
   which was simply doing a good deed for the day and spreading extra
   smiles to charity fundraising. One of the charities that fans
   fundraised for was the Prince's Trust which is a charity that Benedict
   is an ambassador for. The [80]Prince's Trust is a charity that helps
   disadvantaged young people in the UK to help and support them to get
   into education and work. Currently the Birthday Batch collections has
   raised over £15,500 for the Prince's Trust which is amazing! Despite
   the negative stereotype of fans being overly obsessive, I love how so
   many people from all over the world can raise so much money in the name
   of one man: Benedict Cumberbatch.
   I believe the fundraising page is still open for donations. So if you'd
   like to get involved and donate to the Prince's Trust you can do by
   clicking [81]here.
   Also sneaking in some newer news, the Batch will finally be able to
   photobomb himself by means of his own Madame Tussaud waxwork! I
   personally have never been to Madame Tussaud's but would really love to
   wander round one day if I get the chance to. Maybe I can upgrade my
   picture with Cumberbatch the Cardboard Cut Out to Cumberbatch the
   Waxwork!

   Baby Royal Birthday!
   Can you believe that Baby Prince George is already 1 years old?!
   As he turns 1, it is becoming more and more apparent that George has a
   real eye for nature.
   (Image released for Prince George's birthday by John Stillwell)
   Who remembers the hysteria that this little chubby brought upon his
   arrival? It was all over the news worldwide and on every single channel
   that you flicked on. There were running updates all over the place and
   was pretty hard to miss even with your eyes and ears closed!
   As exciting as it was to know that we'd be having a new little edition
   to the Royal Family, I did feel that the media coverage got a little
   too overcrowded. There were reporters and media camping right outside
   the hospital for days wanting to get the first glance of the baby
   prince. I understand it's something everybody wants to be the first to
   catch and that it's their job to report such a momentous moment but I
   did feel sorry for them, especially Kate, with all this attention. She
   looked great having just had a baby, but I imagine when you've just had
   a baby, the very last thing you want is the whole world watch you and
   take pictures of you as you leave the hospital. I definitely admire
   Kate for still being courteous, despite having just delivered a baby!
   There are a few people who are skeptical of the whole Royal Family, and
   I definitely have my opinions on certain members of the family but I
   really do love the little family unit that is Kate, Will and George.
   There's just something about them being young and just genuinely nice
   people, that makes them so loveable. And quite honestly, Kate really
   reminds me of Princess Diana (whom my mum has always admired - to the
   extent of collecting books on her - and has rubbed off me!) and as sad
   as it is that Princess Diana isn't here to see her eldest son,
   daughter-in-law and grandson, I'm sure she would be so proud!
   Happy First Birthday Prince George!

[98]I did a thing: GRADUATION!

   [99]Email This[100]BlogThis![101]Share to Twitter[102]Share to
   Facebook[103]Share to Pinterest
   [104][graduation.jpg]
   After being sent that in an email near the end of my final semester by
   my University, I actually did it. I made it. And it is the most
   surreal, unexplainable, indescribable feeling that when it happens it's
   like you're just wandering around in a dream.
   Graduation Outfit
   So after my little panic at the end of my [105]School, Sherlock and
   Style post two weeks ago, I dug into my smart clothes basket and
   decided to wear this green, skater dress which has an indented print in
   the material along with a pair of black, smart trousers and a matching
   plain, green scarf.
   I was all set but then two days before my ceremony, my mum walks into
   my room and says "Right, let's go and buy you some Graduation clothes."
   and off I was whisked away!
   [106][graduation+outfit.jpg] I didn't want my mum to spend much, if
   anything at all, but we ended up getting this knee-length, sleeveless,
   navy blue dress which had a black strip around the bottom with a pink
   belt accessory. We also a white, chiffon blouse to go underneath and a
   pair of chino-cut, smart, black trousers with a bold hem down the
   front. And actually, the blouse was several sizes too big but as it was
   on sale, it was the last one. But it all worked out because as it was
   being worn under the dress, all that could be seen was the sleeves
   anyways.
   I paired this new graduation outfit with my own pink scarf to match the
   pink belt that came with the dress and a pair of blue wedged heels that
   I bought from my local market months ago but had never found an
   occasion to wear them. But man, my feet were pleading mercy by the end
   of the day!
   Graduation Ceremony
   Now the ceremony was scheduled for an hour-ish. We were advised to
   arrive at least 90mins before as even though there were tickets
   allocated for guests, the seats were first come first served. So we
   arrived at 10:30am and my ceremony started at 12:15pm. I got dressed in
   my graduation cap and gown, took some pictures with the professional
   photographer, took a picture with Cumberbatch the Cut Out (I shall
   explain later!) and then to the graduation ceremony queue it was.
   Graduation Etiquette
   As we entered the hall, we were told to take off our caps as the
   majority of us were already wearing them. We sat in our seats and
   waited. A speech was made and the guest were welcomed as lecturers and
   academics processed to sit on the stage. The graduands all sat on the
   left and all the guests say on the right of the Hall.
   After speeches were made,
   [107][graduation+meme.JPG]
    the calling of graduates' names began.
   As names were being called out, students queued up by the side of the
   stage where two graduation gown staff were poised ready to fix up your
   misbehaving gown ready for your big moment. As you reach the front of
   the line and the stairs to the stage, your name is read out by the
   President or Dean of your faculty. You walk on stage with your
   graduation cap in your left hand and shake the head of your faculty's
   hand with your right. You walk down the steps at the centre of the
   stage on the left and are handed your graduation certificate where you
   then return to your seat. And just like that, that moment is over in a
   flash.
   After all graduands have returned back to their seats with their
   certificates, a few more words of congratulations is spoken on stage.
   You think it's all over until all graduands are asked to stand. We do
   and then we are congratulated once more as we are asked to put on our
   graduation caps with the tassels on the left. After a few moments of
   fiddling, the hall erupts with applause and shouts and whistles.
   We did it. Class of 2014.
   [graduation+pup.png]
   The organ plays and we follow out in the procession.
   Now Cumberbatch the Cut Out. He, along with other well known names such
   as Professor Brian Cox, Alan Turing, Jack Whitehall and Emily
   Pankhurst, are alumni to my university which means that they have
   studied there. And a fun little thing that the university did was have
   cardboard cut outs of them, amongst other famous alumni, on campus. So
   naturally, the batch and I picture needed to happen.
   Also, there was a photo booth by the cut outs with silly props which my
   sister and I jumped in and all but one picture came out perfectly as we
   weren't ready for the last one. I had some really funky pineapple
   glasses ready for that one too!
   Graduation is such a momentous moment
   and I wish you all educational success in the present and future.
   It can be hard, stressful and sometimes even feel pointless but let me
   tell you,
   the hassle is most definitely worth the tassle!
   And honey, I should see you in a cap and gown!

[111]Footie Took Over My Life!

   [112]Email This[113]BlogThis![114]Share to Twitter[115]Share to
   Facebook[116]Share to Pinterest
   So very unlike myself, my week this week has been consumed by football.
   Intriguing how I have no interest in watching football throughout the
   rest of the year and the second the World Cup is on, I become the most
   patriotic football fan that is physically possible. But now that
   England were out, it was just a matter of watching how the pros do it!
   Did 7-1 really happen? Like REALLY??
   So I'm one of the people who missed the first half an hour of the
   Brazil Vs Germany match. But I was on twitter and my timeline was
   pretty much blowing up. My little sister came running into my room
   shouting the madness that was the 5-0 to Germany score and I was like
   [24-Really...-wow.gif]
   (I feel like the more you stare at this gif, the more sarcastic Tennant
   seems!)
   Decided to be anti-antisocial and went downstairs where my family were
   watching the match and again similarly to myself, they too have a
   sudden patriotic boost when the World Cup greets us every four years.
   As I was watching, I did not think that anything else would happen for
   the rest of the match. I thought, "Yep, I've missed the good part.
   Germany went all out in the first couple of minutes and now they're
   just going to cool off.". Oh how I was wrong! They carried on fighting
   harder like they were still on nil points and hats off to them. 7-1 is
   an incredible score which I believe broke records. Unfortunately for
   Brazil, the host of the World Cup, my heart went out to them but a
   game's a game and Germany definitely brought their A-game; a well
   deserved win.
   [117][brazil-10.jpg?w=640&amp;h=640]
   Brutal and Long; Holland Vs Argentina
   So Holland Vs Argentina were next in the limelight and after Brazil's
   thrashing by Germany's unsuspected win, there was a lot of eyes on this
   game. If it was going to be anything like the repeat of the Brazil Vs
   Germany match, nobody wanted to miss football history in the making and
   everybody was going to tune in - footie fan or not! And again, man was
   I wrong!
   In a few words:
   [118][5389d1373822822-bbc-sherlock-tedious2.gif]
   The game just felt like a game of piggy-in-the-middle with the ball
   just being passed around the pitch back and forth with only
   too-close-for-comfort goals. But genuinely, I felt that bought teams
   were playing really well but they were just so well equally matched,
   which made it hard for either team to score. So expectantly, the game
   went into penalties even after an extra half an our overtime.
   Let's just say, I would NOT want to be the goalie during penalties! The
   pressure of it all in a regular match must be intense anyway as it's
   all down to you who wins, so the pressure during the World Cup is
   pressure that I wound most definitely not be able to handle in any
   case.
   The End.
   [119][Final-Countdown.gif]
   It indeed was the final countdown, and to put it simply Germany won the
   World Cup against Argentina and good on them! Out of the teams that I
   saw play in the World Cup, I definitely feel like Germany played like a
   team of football players rather than pinning their hopes on one good
   player what many believe is exactly what lead to Argentina's loss.
   Germany played strong throughout and what a great win!
   England have got four years to pull their socks up!
   And that's me all "footied" out! Time for a foot massage!

[154]School, Sherlock and Style

   The School Life
   As part of my SKE course that I'm currently on as a pre-PGCE Teacher
   Training course, we were sent out to local high schools just to get a
   feel of what it is like to be back to school again and what it was like
   back to school but from a teachers perspective. As it hasn't really
   been a while since I was in high school, it wasn't much of a change of
   how I remember it being. It's definitely a lot different from a
   teachers point of view now though as you have access to areas where I
   may have previous been denied. Also just for being someone other than a
   teacher at the school or a pupil, you get a lot of inquisitive looks
   and even questions.
   [160][when-someone-walks-into-your-classroom-funny-pictures.jpg]
   I got to see different teachers teach their IT and Computing lessons
   which was a good insight to what I would be doing once I start
   teaching. But what I found a lot of fun was doing a Pupil Trail which
   basically meant I followed one pupil for the day to all their lessons.
   At first I was a bit nervous, I must admit, purely because I didn't
   want the pupil who I was paired up with to feel uncomfortable with me
   following them around to their lessons. But I soon felt this was not
   the case as they seemed more than happy to and was so lovely about it.
   I managed to see an RE, Maths, Music, Science and Food Technology
   lesson which all brought their very different methods of teaching which
   was really was great to see.
   These few days really reminded me the buzz of a classroom and it's
   pupils and the fun you could really create with them. And quite
   honestly, children are the most interesting people you will ever meet
   because they generate an insight to the world that us adults seem to
   forget.
   #221back
   This Friday I was supposed to publish a post on Sherlock a Series 1 on
   my Coach Potato page but I was just so busy with my mini school
   placement and so pooped out by the end of it, I just hadn't got any
   time to produce it. But don't worry, it's definitely on the to do list!
   Having said that, a very exciting Sherlock related announcement was
   made this week almost to cover up the lack of my Sherlock post! On
   Wednesday, Mark Gatiss and BBC One on twitter decided to be a  little
   sneaky and quite the tease reminding us of Moriarty's "Did you miss
   me?" scene from the end of Series 3, Episode 3. And naturally, my whole
   twitter timeline was blowing up along with the Sherlock fandom.
   [161][221back.jpg?w=774]
   Soon after a long wait, and I mean loooong wait, it was announced that
   the official announcement would be announced the following day, which
   was Thursday, at 2:21pm. (I like what they did there! ;)).
   Unfortunately for me, I was away from any means of access to twitter at
   that time so had to wait till I got home to see what the announcement
   was.
   I jumped on twitter the second I could and it was announced that the
   game is on for Sherlock Series 4 for 2015 including a special. This
   basically means that we can definitely look forward to more Sherlock
   goodness but we do will have to wait at least another year and a half!
   The Special is assumed to be broadcasted around Christmas of 2015
   followed by three episodes in the following start of the year similar
   to what we had for Series 3.
   But by golly, my timeline was full of the Sherlock fandom exploding
   which is no exaggeration and a massive understatement. I was just
   swimming in memes.

   Non-Sherlockians Reaction Vs The Entire Sherlock Fandom
    Non-Sherlockian: Relax, it's just a TV show.

   And the wallpaper we all love:
   [165][BsBBk7KIQAAYSxH.jpg]
   (Tweeted by [166]@arwelwjones who is the Production Designer on BBC's
   Sherlock)
   I have seen people complain about the long wait, but I actually quite
   enjoy the hiatus - dare I say it! I feel like the anticipation of it
   all adds to the hysteria that Sherlock creates and makes it that bit
   more exciting when new episodes do air. Moftiss are definitively doing
   that right despite giving the fandom severe palpations in anticipation
   of it all!
   Wait, what do I wear??
   And finally, it has actually just dawned upon me that Graduation is
   fast approaching and I have not got the slightest clue what to wear!
   [167][image.axd?picture=what%20will%20i%20wear.jpg]
   I've never been to someone's graduation, nor do I really know anyone
   who has graduated. As the oldest in my family, I am the first to
   graduate so it's quite the new experience for us all!
   I did a bit of a Google on what we females would typically wear to
   graduation to give myself a bit of an idea and the general consensus
   seems to be a white blouse and a pencil skirt. Now I don't own either
   or even wear pencil skirts for that matter, so I've been browsing
   pictures of people who have graduated. I think as long as I look smart,
   I should be okay. I do have quite a collection of smart clothes as I've
   always had to dress smartly during particular events during university,
   so it shouldn't really be too much of a problem to dig something
   acceptable out to wear.
   Anyways, I'll be sure to report back once I've decided!
   Thanks for reading!
   Take care and keep smiling Sherlockians as we will survive this hiatus
   together!
   Much love, Skeena xxxx

[171]A Week of Celebration!

   [172]Email This[173]BlogThis![174]Share to Twitter[175]Share to
   Facebook[176]Share to Pinterest
   This week was full of this:
   [EMBED]
   Why Hello There 2:1 Honours
   Monday, Tuesday and the start of Wednesday was pretty standard. Come
   Wednesday evening and my 2:1 degree classification was waiting for me!
   I wasn't expecting my results till the Friday but when a friend of mine
   who I saw on that Wednesday said that she got hers that morning, it
   suddenly got so nerve-racking! I checked online the minute she told me
   she had hers, but I had nothing. I just thought maybe their still
   processing everybody's results as we were from two different schools
   within the university.
   I got home and about 5pm-ish, I decided to go online and check again,
   and there was my results for each of my modules averaging out as a 2:1!
   It was a MASSIVE relief to see that final result. After three long
   years, I managed to come out of it with a decent mark considering at
   times I thought that surviving my undergraduate degree was the
   impossible.
   [177][all-the-things-meme-collection-1mut.com-1.gif]
   Having a 2:1 confirms my place at my PGCE Teacher Training course for
   September and also confirms my scholarship that will pay my tuition
   fees for it! So for the next year, I am sorted and no longer in limbo!
   Also, having a 2:1 means that I have got my degree in BSc IT Management
   for Business. I have an actual degree. And if you've had a nosy at my
   [178]Bucket List, one of the things on there is to graduate with a
   degree so I can actually tick something off! Well, half tick - BRING ON
   GRADUATION! :D
   Not So Little, Little Sister
   I was an only child for the first 10 years of my childhood. Although I
   was happy in my own company for these 10 years, there was no doubt that
   I longed to have a sibling. Everybody I knew had a brother or a sister
   or even two brothers and two sisters! I’d always hear the odd complains
   about sisters being annoying and brothers always tackling them to the
   ground but those things were brushed under the rug. From all the
   stories, all I processed was adventures to midnight Mcdonalds and
   secret ice cream trips on a cold night where otherwise would have been
   forbidden by their mums. It sounded AWESOME!
   It is awesome :)
   [179][tumblr_mue17yEKMv1s3h7qyo1_500.gif]

   I have a little sister and she means the absolute world to me! There’s
   10 years between us and most people would see that as a major flaw in
   the relationship, but let me tell you, I’m just as much as a big kid as
   she is! :D I love her so much and I can not imagine being an only child
   for any longer than I was.
   And this week it was her birthday! #EmotionalBigSis I remember being
   her age and now she's that age and I'm like but I want you to stay
   small and fit in my pocket! I wish her the biggest of birthday wishes
   and hope that she has plenty more to come inshAllah!
   Party Time!
   [180][tumblr_mcirmpIqB51qjln0ao4_500.gif]
   If you have siblings, take care of them, respect them and love them,
   whether they are older than you, younger or even the same age! If you
   don’t have a sibling, all is not lost because your siblings are just
   hidden.Your siblings are just very good at disguises. Look at your
   closest friends and cousins. They are your siblings.
   Ramadan Kareem!
   Today is the first day of Ramadan. As a Muslim, one of the five basic
   pillars that we must follow is Sawm (Fasting). For the 30 days of the
   month of Ramadan, we fast from dawn till dusk. This means before dawn
   and the first prayer of the day, Fajr, we eat for the day
   (Suhoor/Sehri) and then we don't eat or drink for the rest of the day
   till the fourth prayer of the day, Maghrib, which is at dusk (Iftar).
   It sounds difficult, and it can be for the first few days as your body
   is so used to eating throughout the day especially when you're bored
   but it is such a great month and a great experience as it re-calibrates
   the mind, faith and humbleness.
   As the days are longer in the summer, the fasts are also longer.
   [Ramadan-meme_summer-300x225.jpg]
   It is a month of giving and charity where the importance of these are
   amplified. We may feel hungry or thirsty for the day but I am so
   grateful that I have food and water at the end of my fast where others
   around the world won't. Fasting is an experience that I would recommend
   to anyone because it really puts life into a grateful perspective.
   And on that lovely note, I wish everyone a fulfilling Ramadan!
   Keep Smiling,
   Skeena xxx

[196]Teaching, England Footie and an Open Day

   [197]Email This[198]BlogThis![199]Share to Twitter[200]Share to
   Facebook[201]Share to Pinterest
   Teacher-To-Be
   This week I began my Pre-PGCE Subject Knowledge Enhancement Course.
   It's basically a short course for a few weeks that will top up my
   knowledge in the areas of Computing and IT as that's the subject that I
   will hopefully be qualifying to teach in.
   There's currently a huge demand for Computing teachers in particular as
   the skill to be able to program is becoming more desirable by the day.
   Here in the UK, the Government have even gone as far as claiming this
   year to be the Year of Code supported by initiatives like the [202]Hour
   of Code.
   There's also a massive push to get girls into computing as computing is
   a very male dominated subject and it really shouldn't be. To put things
   a little into perspective, in this course that I've started this week,
   there are only four of us females with about fourteen males. So to say
   that we're outnumbered is a mega understatement.
   I've always been passionate about teaching and IT has always been one
   of those things that I have just always had an interest in. The
   computing and the programming, I'm not so confident in but it's
   definitely something I'm excited to learn more about and this course
   has already done me wonders. This week we have learnt the basic of
   [203]Scratch (MIT Children's Programming Software) and [204]Python
   (which I can confirm is as scary as it sounds!).
   [205][IT_teacher.jpg]
   (A little dated seeing as schools are phasing out IT and phasing in
   Computing!)
   Apart from the academic side, everyone is so lovely at the course and
   we all get along quite well already which helps in an environment where
   we are all prone to start yelling verbal abuse at our laptops!
   Slow Clap for England...
   [206][football+meme.jpg]
   Oh dear. Need I say more?
   To add to the embarrassment of losing against Uruguay, we still have to
   play Costa Rica even though we are definitely out of the World Cup.
   Plus I like how everyone was still hoping that we'd be able to squeeze
   our way into the next round through the outcome of the Uraguay Vs Costa
   Rica game.
   And the amount if memes I've seen about England's performance is just
   amazing! Haha, it's always good to be able to laugh at yourselves!
   Open Day
   My feet hurt, but I wouldn't not work at my university's open days! So
   on Friday and Saturday we were blessed with beautiful weather for our
   open days for our University.As I've mentioned in previous posts, I'm a
   Student Ambassador for my University which allows me to work at any
   events that the University may hold; in this case it was their Open
   Days.
   I've worked on their open days in the past and they have always been a
   lot of fun. For all of the past Open Days that I have worked on, I have
   always been selected to do Campus Tours which is a tour of the
   university main campus pointing out the main buildings and facilities
   we have. I would get a headset microphone which would always make me
   feel like a 90's popstar!
   Pointing out buildings like:
   [207][Britney.jpg]
   One fact that I always love to include is that Benedict Cumberbatch is
   an Alumni of the University whenever we pass the Music and Drama
   Building. I always have people's ears perk up at the sound of his name
   with a few "Ooo really??"'s. And I always like to have a bit of
   audience participation asking "So Benedict Cumberbatch is famously
   known for playing..." and I wait for an answer. Sometimes when nobody
   answers, I'm like "Right, all of your homework tonight is to watch
   Sherlock. It's mandatory!". Always gets a bit of a smile and a giggle!
   [208][sherlock+fandom+uniform.jpg]
   This time, I was actually based as part of the Student Accommodation
   team processing people in the queues who wanted to go on a Student
   Accommodation tour and walking them to the coaches that would take them
   there. At first I was a bit gutted that I didn't get my usual Campus
   Tour Guide role but liked that I could do something a little different
   for my last Open Day that I would work on!
   Plus they had sweets and lollipops so all was not lost!
   That's me for the week!
   I hope the football wasn't too disappointing for you!
   Keep Smiling,
