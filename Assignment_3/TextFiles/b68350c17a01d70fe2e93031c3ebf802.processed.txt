Welcome

Oh hi, I didn’t see you there.

   This is my new web presence; proper blog posts will be coming shortly
   to detail my various projects, past and present. For now, please check
   out my [5]about page to learn a little bit about who I am and what sort
   of content to expect here moving forward. I’m looking forward to having
   a decent space on the web, finally; I hope you’ll check back in as I
   get more content up. Thanks!

–Matt–
