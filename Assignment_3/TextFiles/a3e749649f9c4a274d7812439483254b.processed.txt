[10]Spider-Man 2 (USA 2004)

Manic-Depressive Super Hero

   Directed by Sam Raimi; Starring: Toby Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Alfred
   Molina

   Okay, I was taken in too. Blech.

   After Michael Keaton's quirky but human performance in Batman (1989),
   and the character driven drama at the heart of the
   first Spider-Man (2002), I was ready to believe that comic book movies
   could be taken seriously as films. That is, they didn't have to be
   confined to a genre ghetto, but emotionally - at  least - could be
   believable enough to be discussed in the same terms as any other drama.

[14]King Kong (USA 2006)

Nothing Exceeds Like Excess

   Directed by Peter Jackson; starring Naomi Watts, Jack Black, Adrian
   Brody.

   Just as Wile E Coyote and the Roadrunner are natural enemies, so movie
   directors must fight against against evil studio bosses in their
   eternal struggle to make Great Art despite corporate interference. Or
   so the Hollywood myth has it. Lately, though, I've noticed that many of
   my favourite movies have actually been made despite - or perhaps,
   because of - heavy handed studio oversight. Hmm... Perhaps discipline
   and financial control can actually be good for the creative process.

[18]Garden State (USA 2004)

Artsy But Not Fartsy

   Directed and written by Zach Braff; Starring: Zach Braff, Natalie
   Portman, and Ian Holm.

   Artsy without being fartsy, quirky without being clueless, Garden
   State is one of the best original movies from Summer 2004. It is also
   the best answer to those crashing bores who go on and on about how the
   US is only good at making big, hollow, special effects movies whilst
   Europe (and perhaps Canada…) produce all the character-driven Films.

[22]Star Trek (USA 2009)

Does What it Says on the Tin

   Directed by JJ Abrams; starring: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Leonard
   Nimoy, Eric Bana,  Bruce Greenwood, Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, and Simon
   Pegg.

   JJ Abrams' reboot of the Star Trek franchise begins with a brilliant
   idea. It travels all the way back to the original series for a new
   adventure with Kirk, Spock, Bones, and the rest - still the best (and
   best loved) crew of any Trek franchise. Yet, by focusing on their
   previously unseen early lives and first voyage it is able to tell its
   own, original story (and find a way to finally retire the old stagers
   for a hot new cast).

[26]Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (UK 2009)

Harry Potter Gets Ready to Graduate

   Directed by David Yates; Starring Daniel Radcliff, Rupert Gint, Emma
   Watson, Michael Gambon, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, et al.

   Discussion of books or movies tends to focus first on plot; this is
   what "the story" is all about, after all. And yet, the Harry Potter
   series stands as evidence of how unimportant plot really is to
   narrative (because the plotting of the books is awful). The problem is
   the formula, set in the first volume, that each episode follows a full
   school year at Hogwarts Academy. A typical Potter story, then, has an
   introductory sequence with Harry in the real wold, followed by a
   magical train journey to Hogwarts. Early in the new term he discovers
   some deadly threat to the Wizard world - and then promptly does nothing
   about it for increasingly lame reasons. There are still months and
   months to fill with peripheral action, after all, before graduation and
   the end of the story.

[30]The Brave One (USA 2007)

Artsy Crap is Still Crap

   Directed by Neil Jordan; Starring: Jodie Foster, Terence Howard, Mary
   Steenburgen...

   Once a director is established as an artiste it seems they can get
   routinely get away with conventional schlock that would be instantly
   dismissed in the hands of lesser mortals . Witness the excessive praise
   showed on David Cronenberg's A History of Violence, which featured some
   of the hoariest gangster movie cliches in the book. Or how seriously
   Paul Haggis' pedantic Crash was taken despite its complete disconnect
   from anything resembling the real world (including a final accident
   scene featuring not one, but two leaking gas tanks and a rescue from a
   car about to explode).
