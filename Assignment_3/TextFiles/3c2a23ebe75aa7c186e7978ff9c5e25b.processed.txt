Amber Gulla's Summary

   I'm a 2013 graduate from Northwestern University where I received my
   M.S. in Journalism. I am currently the Public Relations/Communications
   Intern at the Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control.
   As the intern I assist with press releases, schedule social media posts
   and create some of the content, write feature articles for the
   company's intranet site and newsletter, while gaining experience in
   both internal and external communications.
   I am proficient in Microsoft Office (Word, Powerpoint, Excel, Outlook)
   and Adobe Creative Cloud (Photoshop, InDesign, Audition, Premiere Pro),
   and have basic knowledge of HTML/CSS.

       A first-of-its-kind trachea transplant was performed earlier this
       month at the Children's Hospital of Illinois. Dr. Paolo
       Macchiarini, along with other surgeons, also created the windpipe
       via laboratory, which was made of nano fibers and the young child's
       stem cells. With a very unlikely chance of rejecting the
       transplant, doctors hope to make progress in the future with other
       organs.

       The Chicago Department of Public Health released this week a new
       campaign to reduce teen pregnancy. Unlike previous billboards, teen
       boys are the ones pictured pregnant. The new billboards are

       current patients. While many families of the children participated

       hospital as a thanks for all they have done for them.

       Children with autism leave out silly or unnecessary actions when
