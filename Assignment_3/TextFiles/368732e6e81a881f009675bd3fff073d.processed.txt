[69]Who will be the Twins next manager?

   Late Monday morning, the news came out that the [70]Minnesota Twins had
   fired manager Ron Gardenhire. Gardenhire has been offered a job in the
   organization, but he says that he wants to manage again and believes
   that he will.
   So the next question naturally becomes; who will be the next manager of
   the Minnesota Twins?

[79]Twins Trade Targets

   The Twins are closer than they seem. Santana, Vargas, Arcia, Sano and
   Buxton are going to lead this team somewhere. I see no reason why the
   Twins can't be aggressive this off-season and make it happen. If the
   Twins trade for an outfielder and a starting pitcher, the boost we
   would receive mid-summer with the arrival of Buxton and Sano could give
   them what they need to be a legitimate playoff contender. I have
   selected my top five trade candidates for both pitcher and outfielder.
   Obviously, some are more realistic than others.

[82]Should the Twins Emulate the Royals?

   On Friday night, the Kansas City Royals clinched a playoff spot for the
   first time in 29 years. It will be a short postseason appearance if
   they can't beat the Athletics on Tuesday, but finally KC has emerged
   from the void.
   The Twins, now coming off their fourth straight "rebuilding year" where
   little progress was shown in the win/loss column, are becoming familiar
   with a dynamic that characterized the Royals throughout their lengthy
   drought: the moving goalpost. A finish line that inches further away as
   you race toward it.

[92]Twins Top Prospects Part 3: 21-30 (Preliminary)

   Earlier in the week, we started looking at my preliminary Top 50 Twins
   prospects list by reviewing [93]prospects 41-50 and then [94]prospects
   31-40. Today, we’ll look at the next ten prospects, 21-30. This portion
   of the list includes several southpaws, a couple of hard-throwing
   bullpen arms and a couple hitters with potential.

[97]Brian Duensing: Striking Out Batters, Striking Out Cancer

   Brian Duensing did not always anticipate a career in baseball, nor did
   he envision that he would one day have a significant impact on numerous
   families. But now he's doing both.
   Although actively playing sports from the age of six, Duensing
   considered himself a very average athlete. Duensing primarily pursued
   football up until high school. His freshman year, however, he found
   himself a bit undersized.

[100]The 16 Walks of Phil Hughes

   On Wednesday, Phil Hughes made his final start of the season for the
   Twins. It capped a memorable first year in Minnesota for the former
   Yankees pitcher. He signed with the club as the lesser of two big
   off-season upgrades to the rotation but he turned out to be the staff
   ace.
   One of the most amazing parts of this season for Hughes has been his
   ability to virtually eliminate walks while still being a very effective
   pitcher.

[107]If I Owned the Twins

   I’ve been a bit out of touch with Twinsville for a couple of weeks as
   I’ve had some business travel and other non-Twins-related matters to
   occupy most of my time.
   I did catch up a bit on my Twins reading in the past day or so,
   however, and – well – let’s just say I’ve been much more interested in
   the writing about the Twins than I have been with what’s transpired on
   the field with the Twins.

[110]Hughes ends season with record. Without bonus?

   It appears the Phil Hughes 2014 season is complete. He ends the year
   with 186 strikeouts and just 16 walks. The 11.6 K/BB rate is the best
   in MLB history.
   Of course, if he is done, he also finished with 209.2 innings. If the
   rain had not fallen and he recorded one out in the ninth inning today,
   he would have received a $500,000 bonus. 16 wins, 16 walks, 16 HR
   allowed. Pretty incredible season!
