			<p><a href="http://mkdevlin.com">HOME</a></p>
<p>Can you spot a fake? We are notoriously commenting, Twittering, updating, posting, reviewing and spreading bits of information. How on earth are we to trust it all?</p>
<p>What&#8217;s worse than a bad review? Or no reviews? Or reviews from a well meaning family member?</p>
<h4>A FAKE BOOK REVIEW</h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s break it down.</p>
<p>You find a book on Amazon with 2094 reviews. It&#8217;s mentioned online in popular blogs, &#8216;news&#8217; articles, maybe even a morning variety show, and so forth. All those little stars next to the # of reviews are yellow. Hardly any gaps of white (which would indicate bad reviews).</p>
<p>Then you start reading the reviews. The glowing positive ones usually have one thing to say, &#8220;lovely&#8221;, or &#8220;some good advise&#8221;, or &#8220;This book changed my life&#8221;, or &#8220;You have to get it!&#8221;</p>
<p>See the trend? They rarely describe the meat of the book or why they loved it. Trying to fake someone&#8217;s excited, glowing opinion is actually a lot harder than these <em>&#8216;scammers&#8217; -</em>(hacks) think.  Some of the five star reviews are maybe a paragraph or two long. But they sound like they were written by the publisher. Did someone copy the text off the back cover?</p>
<p>Another hint of a possible fake review:  Next to the reviewer&#8217;s name (many times it&#8217;s not a real name), will be the link to <em>See all my reviews. </em>Now, how many of those five star, glowing reviewers have bought much else? How many of them bought other books in the same category? Why are they buying only ONE book about improving your career? Why not buy several? Maybe they bought <em>How to Never Work Again (I don&#8217;t know if this is a real book or not, I just made it up), </em>and then bought a pack of dog biscuits and seat belt repair kit?</p>
<h4>WHY FAKE A BOOK REVIEW?</h4>
<p>Well, as we all know on Amazon, the more reviews, the higher up in the search results your book moves. More reviews = more popularity = your book is seen front and center on pages of Amazon.  You, the potential buyer, is hooked on all the thousands of reviewers giving the book a 5 star review. It MUST be good! You want your life changed NOW! (Like it promises).</p>
<p>But perhaps it&#8217;s really not good. Or it&#8217;s all misdirection. Or it promises things and never delivers. Maybe the writing sucks. Maybe it&#8217;s a snake oil sham. Or maybe it&#8217;s a bunch of carefully chosen words and sentences to motivate you (but you end up depressed). So obviously, to get a bad book some heavy attention and lots of sales, you need to drum up some glowing reviews. Sure, there will be some who honestly liked the book. But when it comes to self help or career coaching or get rich quick &#8211; we&#8217;ve heard the same old thing over and over and over again. The promises get rather familiar. Our brain scours the book waiting, hoping for the one tidbit that&#8217;s going to provide the &#8220;Ah-Ha!&#8221; moment.</p>
<p>When it comes to get rich quick, I have some advice. Here&#8217;s what you need to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a bad book and get a ton of fake reviews.</li>
<li>Get the book mentioned in blogs, social media and saps who actually follow the advice but aren&#8217;t a success.</li>
<li>Find a sugar daddy</li>
<li>Play the lottery (you may have to be dirt poor for a very long time).</li>
<li>Or hope luck will come your way</li>
</ul>
<p>Want to really get rich? Be a doctor or lawyer. Or write a book helping others avoid the pitfalls of GET RICH QUICK schemes that are so artfully hidden in &#8216;helpful&#8217; books.</p>
<p>Otherwise, write honest, truthful reviews, ignore the fake ones. If you&#8217;re like me and have no budget to market a book or lack the morality to blast said book in everyone&#8217;s face, then you work hard, keep writing and plugging away every single day. Yes, weekends too.</p>

<p>Late last night I deleted my personal Facebook account. No, not the one associated with my writing. The one associated with my own personal life. The one only family and close friends are, well, friend<em>-ed</em> on.</p>
<p>I had to do a little internet surfing to find out how to delete my Facebook account. Facebook doesn&#8217;t make it very clear how to close down your account and there are two options &#8211; take a break from it, or actually delete the entire thing. Deleting the whole thing takes time. If you log back on in 14 days, your account becomes active again.</p>
<p>Why go through the trouble to delete a Facebook account? When the real question is,</p>
<h4>Why should you have a Facebook account at all?</h4>
<p>Part of me is old fashioned. A large part. Human contact trumps all other mode of contact. Yes! Face to face speech and eye contact is fast becoming extinct and whether or not you want to believe that or agree with it, just look at cell phone companies. Major cell phone companies now offer plans with unlimited texting and calling minutes. Yet you better watch that data package. Going over your data limit may cost heavily. The point is that people aren&#8217;t calling each other anymore. And even texting is too much effort.</p>
<p>Young people, even the middle aged are &#8216;communicating&#8217; via Facebook posts and comments or Twitter feeds. Instagram and other photo-social media platforms would bring up the rear when it comes to communicating. Some have turned to Skype or other real time video chat, but believe me &#8211; it&#8217;s not the mass population doing this.</p>
<p>Back to Facebook. If you are reading this post, you may be in the minority. People don&#8217;t like to read. They like to interact. That&#8217;s why human to human direct contact is so satisfying (unless you have a disorder, but that&#8217;s a topic for another time).</p>
<p><strong>Reasons I gave up on Facebook (for my personal account):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It feels like high school but worse. It&#8217;s like a giant clique. You&#8217;d better post carefully in order to get attention and followers of what you say. If you don&#8217;t get a response on an update, you wonder, &#8220;What did I do wrong?&#8221; And strange feelings of doubt, anger, sadness, confusion, and even narcissism crop up. WHY ISN&#8217;T ANYONE PAYING ATTENTION TO ME!? My shit is special and everyone is ignoring me!! Whoops. Then you realize you&#8217;ve become one of those &#8216;drama people&#8217; that everyone else complains about by using memes (which I hate). Have a feeling? Then say it darnit, don&#8217;t put up a meme with a dumb photo and poem.</li>
<li>I worry about all that information I&#8217;m posting&#8230;.what I&#8217;m doing, when, how, why. Is someone going to find an old post of a glass of wine I was drinking and call me an alcoholic? Is someone, one day, going to find a rant I wrote and label me bipolar? The future legal implications are vast. I&#8217;m not willing to put my personal life on display anymore &#8211; yet that is the #1 rule of Facebook: GET PERSONAL.</li>
<li>Data mining. Never heard of this? Google it then and come back and ask me if I&#8217;m paranoid for good reason. Yes, the NSA, and every other private and governmental institution is following me and you and taking notes. The real fun begins when the notes become evidence, cataloged and stored, only to be recalled when useful.</li>
<li>Facebook will convince you that your own life sucks. It is dripping with updates of your high school friend showing off her sexy new husband and the insanely cute child they created. It shows you that the boyfriend that took you to the prom is now happily married and has a great job. It makes you compare the body you have tried to sculpt, mold, craft through running 25 miles per week, eating only salads and visiting a gym every day, to a friend who constantly takes selfies in her bikini and has like 4 kids and no stretch marks. You suddenly feel the urge to visit a plastic surgeon. You decide you look ugly because you have blooming grey hair and everyone else is blond and fabulous. Everyone else has awesome cars but yours is 21 years old and looks like a piece of sh**. You can&#8217;t help but wrestle with a new found envy and jealousy - which is the furthest thing that ever used to cross your personality.</li>
<li>Trolls. And I&#8217;m not talking about those crazy fat nerds that sit on a computer all day with pizza crust collections on the edges of their desk and the interior of their house is so dark it dwarfs black holes in the cosmos. I&#8217;m talking about the kind of trolls that look like you and me, or a housewife with cute curly blond hair and updates about the awesome deal she got on QVC &#8211; a glittery lamp in the shape of a tree that uses half a battery to operate. Suddenly she comes out of nowhere and SLAMS you for stating your opinion. Kohls suddenly infects your Facebooks feed with an &#8216;advertisement&#8217; (you never liked Kohl&#8217;s page in the first place) about some butt ugly dolls you can have if you spend $75 bucks at their store. They claim they are going to give you a doll and donate to charity. But &#8211; the dolls are LAME. Not worth $75 of clothing you really didn&#8217;t want to buy anyway but convinced yourself to do so. And Kohl&#8217;s  won&#8217;t tell you exactly which charity they might send .0001% of a your purchase to. Suddenly the curly haired, QVC shopper strikes and tells you for all the world to see on FB that you are a horrid person for not liking these dolls and you are pond scum, refusing to donate to a worthy cause, and that your opinion should be only used on THINGS THAT MATTER. Suddenly you (me) are labled a HATER, a degenerate, the lowest of the low and you are nearly gang raped and beat up on in cyberspace. All for voicing an opinion on Kohl&#8217;s dolls that are made in some Chinese sweat shop, look grotesque and it is so gimmicky you are shocked that anyone would fall for such a stupid ploy. You are ATTACKED.</li>
<li>I actually felt more lonely on Facebook than not doing it at all.&#8221;<span style="color: #4c4c4c;"> <em>In a healthy social life, there is no room for Facebook, because when you are an active participant in the lives of those you love, social media has nothing to offer you.</em></span>&#8221; <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/234598">Hat tip</a>. That&#8217;s just it. Facebook is a FALSE MECHANISM. It does not really gain you true insight into other people or into the lives of those you hold most dear. In fact, it really reinforces the fact that we are all very much alone on this planet. We have to work at it to get along and come together. Facebook is convincingly deceptive that we are all interconnected online and in life. There is much more to life outside of Facebook.</li>
<li>Addiction. I was trying to date a new guy while living in Montana. When he finally &#8216;made time for me&#8217; and came over to my house. All he did was sit on the couch, and do his Facebook app on his phone. Meanwhile anytime my eyes glanced over, he shrouded his phone so I couldn&#8217;t see. I tried later adding him as a friend, but he lied saying he never goes on Facebook. Well, maybe Facebook actually helped me out this time. I learned quite quickly that this guy was a total PLAYER. And he used Facebook to find the next best thing. Which wasn&#8217;t me. But guys (and I assume girls) are so wrapped up in updating and posting, they don&#8217;t give any attention to what&#8217;s happening in real life. How are relationships supposed to get off the ground this way? I have to put Facebook in the category of ADDICTION. If you can&#8217;t go out to dinner or your potential girlfriend&#8217;s house without constantly checking your Facebook account &#8211; something is really wrong with you.</li>
<li>Scammers are making fake profiles and trying to &#8216;friend you&#8217;. If you have 1589 friends, how on earth do you know that each one of them are true and not a hacker or scammer, recording everything you do. Or worse, a stalker. Maybe your abusive ex-boyfriend has disguised himself as someone else and is slowly winning your attention and affection. Ever see MTV&#8217;s Catfish show? Facebook is THE main way these &#8216;Catfish&#8217; operate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh and I could go on and on. Even if you use Facebook only for promotion for a business or product. All it take is ONE negative comment or an unhappy customer to start spreading rumors and lies. You might find yourself shut down, business destroyed and dream disintegrated. Be careful. Facebook can be a very effective weapon and a tyrant when it wants.</p>

										<a href="http://mkdevlin.com/2014/06/leaving/" title="Permalink to Leaving"><img width="700" height="446" src="http://mkdevlin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/P1300458.jpg" class="attachment-700x700 wp-post-image" alt="P1300458" /></a>
			
			<p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;"><em>Above image is the state flower of Montana, the Bitterroot.</em></span></p>
<p><a href="http://mkdevlin.com">HOME</a></p>
<p>I planned on living in Montana forever. But in 12 days I am moving back to the Silver State. There <em>are</em> worse areas to live than Nevada. I&#8217;ve lived in some of them. But the decision was made with a heavy heart and resistant mind to leave Big Sky Country.</p>
<p>I tend to fall in love with nature. The land. The weather, the environment and extremes are really quite thrilling to me. There is a slight midwestern friendliness here in the capitol city but less so in more populated areas of Montana. I will miss the greetings from complete strangers and frequent but random acts of kindness. I keep telling myself that one day I will return and buy a ranch and raise horses. Yet Nevada is known for wild mustangs and there definitively is a lot more horseback riding and equine opportunities.</p>
<p>With most of my family, some aging and some ill, situated in California I knew what my ultimate decision would be some time ago. I am more mobile than they are. And that mobility doesn&#8217;t come easy with two active Labs. Oh yes there are other factors &#8211; the lack of clean, affordable rentals in Montana, good hospitals and extreme weather means being indoors a lot. Yes I fought through negative 40 degrees and played in the snow, burnt off my face, lost feeling in my fingers and plowed a steep 500 foot driveway covered in snow. But I&#8217;ve also given up hiking, bike riding, running, bowling, swimming, inline skating, a leisurely walk with my dogs without carrying some serious self defense.</p>
<p>Nevada has it&#8217;s downsides too. But I was never chased by a deer and left struggling to breathe due to acute asthma exacerbation in the emergency room. I never dealt with a prowling Mountain Lion around my house. I never had to get permission to set foot on a trail or open piece of land. Much of the BLM in Montana is hard to get to and figuring out where private property meets public land is tough. Access to BLM up the road from me is protected at the entrance by big NO TRESPASSING signs. And the one accessible public shore area to swim safely on the Missouri River in Helena is controlled by BLM nazi people that smell like they smoke 30 packs a day.</p>
<p>Neighbors are fickle in Montana. I can&#8217;t express how many people I&#8217;ve met who are born and raised here yet don&#8217;t even know their neighbors or their first names. In the last two years here I&#8217;ve watched some big national chain stores crop up, while locals shake their head and call these businesses &#8220;too fancy for Montana&#8221;. Yet I see fancy cars all over the place and small homes selling for $400,000. I think Montana is going through some growing pains unfortunately. They didn&#8217;t experience much strife during the housing market demise or recession. Employment in Helena hovers around 3.8% yet most of the jobs are part time or low wage. It&#8217;s commonplace to work two jobs. The poor are everywhere. I see one homeless man standing on the way out of Walmart constantly with a cardboard sign that says, <em>Smile, it could always be worse</em>.</p>
<p>Without delving into all the negatives about Big Sky Country, it&#8217;s time for me to move on and leave. I need to pack a few more boxes and sell off some more furniture.</p>
<p>Could the real reason I&#8217;m leaving is to return to the sparkling glacial rock that inspired my first romance novel, White Rock? Yes, perhaps. Nevada has granite beneath all the shifting debris of the high desert. But very close to the western edge of where the grand Sierras meet the Great Basin is a stretch of rock that I cannot resist any longer. It calls to me. It&#8217;s magnetic and mysterious.</p>
<p>Leaving is hard stuff. Returning isn&#8217;t easy either but all I can say now is that I&#8217;m glad I moved to Montana and I&#8217;m a lot tougher because of it. Perhaps one day again I will gaze upon the emerald sea of the great plains with sheer awe and disbelief as I always do. Maybe the Northern Rockies will welcome me back with a rush of sweet breezes and subtle nod to come get fully lost in a land that is truly wild.</p>

<p>Have you ever felt manipulated? Let me re-phrase that: Have you ever had that feeling that something is wrong but you are so confused and doubting every other thought that crosses your mind that you begin to wonder if you&#8217;re going insane?</p>
<p>Welcome to gaslighting. I&#8217;m highlighting this topic today because I&#8217;ve been through it myself but also the main antagonist in White Rock is a skilled gaslighter, or master manipulator.</p>
<p>Think it can&#8217;t happen to you? Guess again. It&#8217;s often hard to recognize at first in a relationship. Left unchecked it can do some serious harm and long term disruption. It&#8217;s slightly different than just an overbearing or controlling person. Gaslighting is often hard to pinpoint and happens over time. Not like a big fight. It&#8217;s very intangible. Other people in your life may chalk it up to something else. The gaslighter or manipulator has convinced you of an alternate reality. Oh, you may come up for air sometimes and see that something is really wrong, or even assert what you know to be the truth. But if the manipulator has his or her hooks deep into your psyche, and it&#8217;s been going on for some time, it may be very hard to identify the situation.</p>
<p>Wikipedia coins gaslighting as a form of abuse. And since I&#8217;ve been through it myself, I would heartily agree.</p>
<p>In a nut shell, the manipulator creates doubt, unease and the victim is lead carefully into a world lacking self confidence. It can go as far as the victim thinking they really are mentally insane, therefore they need to rely on the manipulator since they are convinced that their own functioning, reasoning and beliefs are wrong and faulty.</p>
<p>Of course gaslighting can be extreme or subtle. It can come in layers or waves.</p>
<p>In White Rock, Kris has seen the negative influence Adam has had on her. His charms and delusional tactics  that kept her so blinded to all his other faults are not enough for her to stay with him. But when Kris asserts herself and starts seeing someone new, Adam is unable to let go.  As many manipulators are, he is patient to win over his prize. The darker side of him that is nearly out of control is contained by another obsession. By biding his time anopportunity arises to get Kris back.  I don&#8217;t go to far with the gaslighting tactics in White Rock, but the sequel will demonstrate how and why such a crazy, evil character can keep someone psychologically hostage.</p>
<p>So this type of sociopath &#8211; charming and unassuming &#8211; are really accomplished liars. They aren&#8217;t stupid, although they may come off so arrogant that the target individual may chalk them up to an idiot with low intelligence. The gaslighter may be highly gifted in the powers of persuasion, falsifying, suspending belief and creating an atmosphere of doubt but they may lack true empathy and compassion, although with selflessness.</p>
<p>The gaslighting individual relishes the power he has over his victim. It soothes and satiates for awhile but usually it is never enough. They may be struggling with addiction, mental disorders or even something as extreme as the need for committing serial and horrific acts and crimes.</p>
<p>Kris might seem insecure at times. I wrote her that way on purpose. She often feels confused and doubts honest intentions by those close to her. At times she shuts down, which is almost likened to a mode of self preservation. I touch on some of this with the first book, but I take a deeper look at gaslighting in White Rock II (sequel unnamed as of right now).</p>
<p>Google Gaslighting for a bigger picture of what it is. Or check out an <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/power-in-relationships/200905/are-you-being-gaslighted" target="_blank">article in Psychology Today</a>.</p>

			<p>The internet is a great phenomenon. Do you use Wikipedia to look stuff up? This may have you taking a step back.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2131458/Up-articles-Wikipedia-contain-factual-errors.html" target="_blank">Up to six in ten articles on Wikipedia contain inaccuracies according to new research.</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/04/120417113527.htm" target="_blank">another article here&#8230;</a></p>
<p>I admit I blindly trust Wikipedia on a vast majority of topics. I never question it&#8217;s validity. But I began wondering after I read the above articles. Would the same mistakes happen in a hard copy Encyclopedia Britannica? Maybe not, because there is a lot more editing and fact checking before publishing a book rather than a website. But it sure is a lot harder to update a physical encyclopedia than Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I still turn to the Physician&#8217;s Desk Reference to look up drug interactions and side effects rather than Drugs.com or rxlist.com. The PDA used to be a published manual. A huge, heavy book with tiny print. It was THE reference for pharmacists. I know this because my dad was a pharmacist for 32 years. It&#8217;s accuracy and wealth of information far surpasses the misunderstandings found on the web.</p>
<p>Who, then, has all the answers? Where do we go to find the truth? An iPhone app? Amazon.com? Blogs. Twitter feed. A friend. The answer isn&#8217;t really clear. But what I&#8217;m getting at is that the answers that you find these days usually come electronically off the web, which may be a rather unreliable source or something we don&#8217;t question.</p>
<p>When it comes to self publishing and writing there is a LOT of opinion but very few tangible facts. I admit freely I Google all the time, &#8220;how to make money with self publishing&#8221;, &#8220;how to be a better writer&#8221;, &#8220;how to get more reviews&#8221;, &#8220;how, how, how, when, why&#8230;&#8221; My searches turn up blogs that SEEM helpful but are really advertising ploys. They haven&#8217;t helped me at this point. Or, some have but the help was so small I wonder if plowing and rummaging through so much signing up, and GET MY FREE PODCAST NOW  (laden with incessant talk about nothing of substance), perhaps the tiny grain of useful information was just an enormous waste of my time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>I&#8217;ve come to some conclusions based on wasting a lot of time trying to find self publishing answers:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There is no magic way to get a bunch of reviews unless you have a bag of money.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There is no pot of gold at the end of the self publishing rainbow.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There is no entity that will selflessly take your hand and walk you through it all.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The only way to be a better writer is study writing, learn, write, and read. If you still don&#8217;t get it, maybe writing isn&#8217;t your gift or fortee. I love to sing. But I suck as a singer. I took vocal classes. I still sucked. I can play just about any wind or keyed instrument you put in front of me but cover your ears if I&#8217;m on the drums or guitar.</p>
<p>My point is we all have avenues we excel in. Maybe you are a good writer, but not great. Maybe I&#8217;m a good writer but not great. Maybe I&#8217;m a better storyteller. Maybe I&#8217;m a better illustrator.</p>
<p>Perhaps nobody has all the answers and nobody ever will. You know on the deep interior corners of your mind how to get the good information you seek. It takes effort and time. You can choose to believe my answers or ignore them completely. See how that works?</p>
<p>Lastly I wonder if maybe some answers are true for some people but not other people. People search out the answers mainly to confirm what they already know. And maybe it&#8217;s a total waste of time to find the answers to some questions. It&#8217;s one thing to watch a YouTube video on how to change your oil. It&#8217;s another to watch a long seminar with some dude that needs a large does of Ritalin for his ADHD, telling you how to market a book.</p>
<p>I could of written 6,000 words while the maniac yipped and yapped to get his TRIED AND TRUE method across. What kind of answer is <em>that</em>?</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m here to scream there is nothing wrong with it. Yes your life might be diffucult or limited to live out those dreams depending on what they are. But maybe, just maybe you can make them happen. If you suspend common criticism and the belief that we all need to have a crappy 9-5 job, big house, nice car, white picket fence, blah, blah, blah, 2.5 kids and a dog laying in front of the fireplace, perhaps if you suspend what you think is expected of your life, you will see the bigger picture.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not knocking the average life. I admire people who put all their effort and time into job and family. I do it too, but just differently.</p>
<p>Dreams have a funny way of creeping up in the back of your head and reminding you they are still there. They don&#8217;t want to be squashed entirely. Whether those dreams are living naked on an island in the Caribbean or making it to the top of a Fortune 500 company, dreams aren&#8217;t silly. They are there for a reason. And sometimes you can live those dreams and find out they weren&#8217;t as satisfying as you thought. Or maybe along the way in trying to achieve the dream, you take a side step and go in a different direction. More doors open up and thing start to happen.</p>
<p>I think when you pursue dreams you are taking a risk. And these days with our economy, and uncertain times, taking risks is equated with stupidity. How flagrant you are! Really? Or maybe taking a risk is necessary. To stay one step ahead of the monotony, the downturn, the dark times. Maybe you can continue on with life as you know it right now but change some minuscule thing that will lead to living out a dream you never thought possible.</p>
<p>Decide to pursue your dreams or not. Whatever calls to you is personal and not a bad decision. It&#8217;s your life.</p>

			<p><strong>Don&#8217;t waste an obvious opportunity to make an impression.</strong></p>
<p>Bella Andre doesn&#8217;t. Web site, links to social media, etc. Use that very first page of your book to let the reader know where else they can find you or how to connect.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a fine line obviously of yammering on too much. You don&#8217;t want to<strong> overdose</strong> your potential reader. They&#8217;ll get sick, gulp down some asprin, skip dinner and go to bed without reading your works at all.</p>
<p>I was a little quirky with the revamp of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1493634887/" target="_blank">The Everyday Zombie Handbook</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_633" style="width: 625px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://mkdevlin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/firstpage.png"><img class=" wp-image-633 " src="http://mkdevlin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/firstpage.png" alt="firstpage" width="615" height="361" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The re-done first page of my zombie book for Kindle.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I stated the <em>revision date</em>. I placed a little<strong> logo</strong>, which is also seen further on in the book (visual cues, very important!). I politely asked the reader to leave a review OR contact me at my site. I don&#8217;t bite &#8212;&gt; a little play on words since the book is about zombies.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>So make that first readable page memorable</em></strong></span>. Different. And perhaps you need to do a revision later on just to post updated information on the first page, or some other useful content.</p>

			<p><strong>Use Your Imagination.</strong></p>
<p>To the left is a long winding trail lined with overgrown thorny plants and poisonous snakes (doomsday folk), ready to strike. But in the distance you see a big shining castle poking through the clouds, sitting right on the edge of a sparkling sea. It&#8217;s really where you want to be. It calls to you. You imagine  the salt air rushing over your weary face. You stare down at the snakes slithering around, ready to thwart your attempt at getting past, getting to your destination, achieving your goal. You wonder if it will be worth it.</p>
<p>To the right (no political pun intended), is another trail that looks pretty straight forward, nicely paved, fresh flowers lining the sides. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any danger at all. There&#8217;s even some fat little bakers handing out free cupcakes with cherries on top along the way. You are overwhelmed and drawn to such pretty things and lack of life threatening creatures that you don&#8217;t bother to see where the trail even goes. In fact all you see is a bunch of rain clouds in the distance. But that&#8217;s good right? Rain makes the flowers grow. But it also makes the weeds grab hold as well.</p>
<h4>Which path do you take?</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ll tell you which one I&#8217;m on right now. The one with snakes. Here&#8217;s why. If I took the easy road the end result looks rather ominous and unsure. What&#8217;s behind the clouds? Salvation? Promises? I don&#8217;t know. I look at that shining castle sitting on the edge of a sparkling sea. I can&#8217;t tell how long the path is or how messed up I&#8217;m going to get trying to make my way but I&#8217;m already starting to beat off the snakes (dooms day people) with a couple of those thorny branches I snapped off. Yeah, there is a possibility I won&#8217;t make it. But what if I do? What&#8217;s left if I don&#8217;t? Cleaning houses?</p>
<p>Time is the ultimate factor here. I&#8217;m speaking to you from my heart and my brain. Give your works time. Don&#8217;t expect a quick road to that castle by the sea. You are braver than you think. Don&#8217;t listen to those serpents and naysayers. Why do they feel the need to give us their dose of reality anyway? We aren&#8217;t trying to live their life by their rules. Yes<em><strong> life is hard</strong></em>. We get that. Yes being a writer is tough. If you don&#8217;t think it is then maybe you SHOULD fear the snakes and go the other direction.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided. I will make it to that castle. There may not be silk sheets and servants catering to my every whim but I don&#8217;t want that anyway. So hurry up. I&#8217;ll meet you there.</p>

										<a href="http://mkdevlin.com/2014/04/elusive-review/" title="Permalink to The Elusive Review"><img width="694" height="694" src="http://mkdevlin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/P1070273-e1398972881166.jpg" class="attachment-700x700 wp-post-image" alt="I do that every morning before my contacts are in." /></a>
			
			<p>Unfortunately people want some type of confirmation before purchasing anything these days. Why <em>unfortunate</em>? I think by being so overly dependent on what other entities think of a certain product, movie or book, we fail to take risks. We stay in the mainstream, never deviating from the path. Never discovering new things. Stuff that opens our eyes, challenges our thoughts.</p>
<h4>What works for one may not for another.</h4>
<p>I have purchased a great many things off Amazon based off glowing reviews. I ignored the few negative reviews. What transpired was a situation that had me wishing I&#8217;d saved my money and never read a review in the first place. Stuff that broke. Didn&#8217;t perform. Dare I say total crap that was reviewed as, &#8220;Amazing!&#8221; &#8220;Wonderful vacuum!&#8221; &#8220;The most amazing movie I&#8217;ve ever seen!!&#8221;. I was left shaking my head wondering who these reviewers were and why the hell did I trust them?</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">There are too many choices. But not enough good ones. I recently bought a Brita filter because that&#8217;s all Walmart had. They were out of PUR &#8211; which I really wanted. But Brita pitchers were stacked everywhere. Different models. Different sizes. Different kits. I didn&#8217;t want Brita though. Now I hate the thing. The lid won&#8217;t stay on and it dumps water all over the counter half the time.</span></p>
<h4>The upside to reviews.</h4>
<p>I was really, really going to buy Fifty Shades of Gray. I was intrigued. It was getting a TON of reviews. My cousin was reading it while on an extended stay in Costa Rica. I thought, hey, I&#8217;m an aspiring romance novelist and have read my fair share of erotic fiction.<em><strong> Then I took a closer look at these reviews:</strong></em></p>
<div id="attachment_584" style="width: 452px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://mkdevlin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/review.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-584 " src="http://mkdevlin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/review.png" alt="review" width="442" height="41" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Capture of actual review from Amazon.com</p></div>
<div id="attachment_585" style="width: 646px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://mkdevlin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/review2.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-585 " src="http://mkdevlin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/review2.png" alt="review2" width="636" height="112" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Capture of another review on Amazon.com about Fifty Shades of Grey</p></div>
<p><strong><em>And then&#8230;.these reviews&#8230;</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://mkdevlin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/review3.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-588" src="http://mkdevlin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/review3.png" alt="review3" width="395" height="32" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://mkdevlin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/review4.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-589" src="http://mkdevlin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/review4.png" alt="review4" width="519" height="31" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://mkdevlin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/review5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-590" src="http://mkdevlin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/review5.png" alt="review5" width="625" height="29" /></a><br />
As for 2014 reviews, it&#8217;s a mixed bag. Some good, some not. The average consensus seems to be that it&#8217;s a porn book that isn&#8217;t for everyone. I might have purchased it except for the overwhelming amount of bad reviews and talk of how badly the book is written. <em>Why would I want to waste my time on bad writing?</em> Of course that&#8217;s taking the reviewer&#8217;s opinion as truth. All in all my time is precious and I am glad I didn&#8217;t buy the book and read it. Instead I took some notes on what NOT to do in my own writing.</p>
<p>Whether you slightly notice reviews or put a lot of faith in them, I think they are precarious and we place too much importance on them. Unfortunately books don&#8217;t sell without a plethora of reviews, (bad or good). <em>Reviews get people talking.</em></p>
<h4>Then why do indie authors have such a hard time obtaining a review?</h4>
<p><em><strong>My educated guesses are -</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Regular readers want the promise of a good story, good writing and satiation. They develop a lot of emotion and devotion to a favorite author. Trying out a new one isn&#8217;t always on their list of things to do.</li>
<li>The book is ranked #4,595,3023 on Amazon. How on earth is the casual online shopper going to <em>find</em> it?</li>
<li>Their book sucks. (<em>I hope mine doesn&#8217;t but anything is possible.</em>)</li>
<li>The self published market is flooded and overflowing with ebooks. Many have jumped on the bandwagon. I saw a children&#8217;s book the other day that was shocking. Really. Someone used the shape tool with a bad paint program on their computer to make the dumbest looking creatures I could ever think of. It wasn&#8217;t done by a kid either. Hello?<em> It had many 5 star reviews!</em> The story had no plot, no point, no significance at all! <em>What am I missing here people?  </em></li>
<li>[Deep sigh.]</li>
<li>But it&#8217;s a free country and if you have an idea by all means, create, publish, write, promote. Do what you must. Do what compels you. I just hope people have some ethics and morality not to badger their friends and family¹ for fake-ish, glowing reviews. Or worse, actually write fake ones about their own stuff. (I&#8217;m only observing here&#8230;because what else explains a sea of 5 star reviews on something my dog could do better?).<strong><em> I wonder if this almost brings down the validity of reviews overall.</em> </strong>Fake reviews punish real, well thought out reviews.</li>
<li>We&#8217;re a busy society. Work. Kids. Car trouble. Bad weather. Family dinner. Maybe people read a book they LOVED and just didn&#8217;t remember to write a review. I love John Steinbeck but I have never reviewed any of his books. Same with J.K. Rowling. (I&#8217;m too busy writing blogs, tweets, books&#8230;.). But I do try and review from time to time, especially authors that aren&#8217;t as well known.</li>
<li>Maybe your indie book was so bad the customer didn&#8217;t want to tell you.</li>
<li>Maybe you indie book was so good the customer didn&#8217;t want to be the only one leaving a review. Maybe they weren&#8217;t sure about being the only reviewer. (Insecurity issues?) Or is it a popularity contest? Nobody else reviewed it so I don&#8217;t want to waste my time here. Oops, I forgot what I even read about.</li>
<li>You get the picture.</li>
</ul>
<h4>To sum up.</h4>
<p>That first real review you have been waiting for seems strangely elusive. You poured so much time, effort, hard work, re-writes, editing, proof reading into the darn thing, and yet no reward of just a nice glowing review at the end of this journey. Sometimes I think the more friends you have, especially on FB, the better off you are. The more people talk about what you&#8217;ve created will obviously  generate some interest in your book. Or not. I told my friends but only one read it. (Thank you!) But what about that review from an independent source? Where is THAT review? Even better &#8211; a positive review from a <em><strong>distinguished</strong> </em>source like say NPR books, or <em>gasp</em>, the NY Times?!  Well, one can only dream, right?</p>
<p>¹ <em>Undoubtedly family and friends will want to review your book out of a sense of obligation or support. Some say these reviews don&#8217;t count but at least they took the time to do it. </em></p>
