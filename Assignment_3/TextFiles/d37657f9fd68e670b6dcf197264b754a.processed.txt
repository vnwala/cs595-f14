   excerpt from a book that i have been writing. sorry if it is slightly
   controversial and if the grammar is bad at the moment. just an informal
   collection of ideas right now.

   "i am sick and tired of watching people put all of their stock in
   angels that they hope will come later. so many of us are impatiently
   waiting for angels to come when we die and for them to carry us
   peacefully into eternal light. i’m all for that idea.. but i believe
   that more often than not.. it blinds us of the angels that exist in the
   NOW. sure.. i am guilty of throwing pennies in wells in case i need
   friends in hell.. but why do so many people place so many nets under
   each and every cliff in life? they want to experience the view but
   don’t want to be prepared to feel the fall. isn’t the possibility of
   the fall what makes it grand? isn’t the inevitability of death what
   drives us to feel alive? playing it safe is truly the most dangerous
   way to live. crazy how little of the population sees that the evils in
   life can be the best church. that your sins can be a sermon.. and the
   lack of sanity itself can be the very cathedral they have been waiting
   for but are ironically already standing in. and angels? people pray to
   them and god as if they only exist in the latter pages. or as if they
   can only be found when the book is finished being read. can’t they see
   that there are angels here and now? they are all around us. are the
   halos not bright enough for them? do they feel as if they have not yet
   been saved? the greatest angels aren’t perfect and the highest heaven
   isn’t pure. my angels have chips in their halos… my angels have tears
   in their wings.. scraped knees and holes in their jeans. my angels are
   broken like me.. sad like me.. but also fighters like me. perfection
   isn’t what determines if light exists. all is created by light in some
   way. after all.. light creates shadows. darkness is the absence of
   light. if you leave this life looking pretty… you didn’t do it right.
   scars are the souvenirs and unlike most theme parks.. the exit is not
   found through the gift shop. you can’t buy them at the end of the ride.
   why don’t more believe in that religion? the religion of here and now?
   the religion of seeing god in the eyes and heartbeat of a fellow
   broken, yet beautiful being? the religion of finding nirvana in a place
   here on earth that captures both our breath and imagination? we spend
   so much time pleading for angels that we don’t take the time to ask
   ourselves what angels truly are. we fail to see that both the gowns of
   white and the horns of night can be found in the very mirrors we vainly
   live by. demons? yes.. them too. i’m not running from them. they can
   come along for the ride. because i see myself in those as well. angels
   are just demons that got second chances… and demons are just angels who
   weren’t ready to say goodbye. we are all saints by day and sinners by
   night. it’s what makes us human. that’s what makes it right. why can’t
   the world we live in be good enough? why do we have to count on places
   outside of our reach? if you want heaven and hell so badly i say love
   like heaven and live like hell. THAT is a religion. THAT is something
   that i am willing to put my time and faith in. religion is not somebody
   else’s book.. it is not somebody else’s story… it is your own. if you
   want a bible… write it. believe in belief, have faith in faith itself,
   and learn to feel love towards love. i live by this and most
   importantly live FOR this. hell.. believe in whatever movement, god, or
   idea that you wish to.. but never believe in anything more than you
   believe in yourself."

   [13]love. the ultimate journey. the ultimate consequence. people spend
   all of their forevers trying to find love. we break open our
   piggybanks.. we paint masks… we become top notch conmen. we keep aces
   up our sleeves and the sheep out of our dreams in hope to find the
   final treasure.. the light at the end of a tunnel.. the pot of gold.
   ironically.. we don&#8217;t yet know who we are conning or stealing
   from until it&#8217;s too late.. because in the end.. we are conning
   ourselves. as people.. for whatever reason, we are wired to steal from
   ourselves. to live within the thoughts that we aren&#8217;t good
   enough.. that we have to fit certain molds with the expectations and
   weights of multiple worlds telling us we have to find love (and to keep
   it) to live a life of value and worth. we are rabbits chasing a carrot
   dangling from a string. riding carousels tricking ourselves into
   believing that we sit upon majestic stallions on our way to a promised
   land of gold and eternity. we spend our entire lives chasing these
   crowns. we pick up gems along the way, sliding them into our pockets
   with sheepish grins, being too greedy to share or to allow them to see
   the light of the day. they become hidden mischievous paper weights
   reminding us that even when we find items of worth.. we will always
   want more. after all.. isn&#8217;t that in our nature? to want MORE.
   because sand isn&#8217;t as grand as a pebble.. which will never be as
   prized as a stone… which only dreams of being as mighty as a mountain.
   what we fail to realize is that the more we strain our bodies traveling
   to find these crowns.. to find love.. the more we turn ourselves into
   walking palms across it&#8217;s very face. contradictions of the very
   sermon we intend to preach. we need to stop hiding behind our own
   eyelids. i have found that the crown can be the ground that our
   starving feet stand and dance upon. life isn&#8217;t always love. it is
   the journey TO love. the pain? that&#8217;s a gem. the disappointment?
   another one. life is a journey.. and in turn becomes the destination
   all at the same time. you already have what you are looking for. it was
   found before you ever started searching for it. if you are walking and
   living in a world that you have yet to understand.. then the battle is
   won. understanding is a hand that i hope my mind never shakes. we
   should enjoy living in wonder. we should enjoy feeling small. instead
   of putting the gems in your pocket, upset that they all individually
   are much smaller than you had hoped to find.. gather the gems and align
   them within the gold that can be found within you flowing through your
   veins and allow them to form a crown. wear it upon your head like a
   sky. love does not shape who you are.. because love is actually not
   knowing who you are. we create IT&#8217;S meaning.. not the other way
   around. love is finding and running into people and places that make
   you redefine it&#8217;s very being. love is the journey itself. this
   why i live with such wanderlust. i thank the universe constantly for
   fairy tales.. for the mountains we&#8217;ll never climb.. for the stars
   we&#8217;ll never see… because maybe love isn&#8217;t found at the end
   of the road… maybe it can be found along the way… maybe love is the
   road itself.  -alexander michael deleon

   i never believed in angels… because i had never felt their wings. i
   never believed in paradise… because i had never held the key. i never
   believed in mirrors… because i hated what i&#8217;d see. i never
   believed in love… because it never believed in me. until you.

[22]THESE ARE THE LIES

   i don’t love you, i don’t need you

   i don’t ever want to see you again

   i have moved on, and things are perfect

   i’m okay with us just being friends.

   cuz i don’t think about you, every single night i am fine without you

     i sleep tight when i’m not beside you.

   i’m moving on, moving on

   no, i don’t cry about you, no those ain’t tears in my eyes about you

   gonna be fine if i die without you

   i’m moving on, moving

   these are the lies

   that i tell myself at night

   these are the lies

   that are keeping me alive.

   cuz the truth is i’m in pieces

   my heart may not survive

   i tell myself i’m fine.

   i know i’ll be alright…

   these are the lies.

[28]don’t be afraid to grow old

   when wrinkles paint your skin… i’ll admire every inch… yes, i’ll hold
   you from within… though versus time we never win… i will love you while
   we live.

   when your hair is turning gray… i will remind you every day… that
   seasons, they will change… but through december i will stay… and be
   your march, april, may.

   when you’re far too old to dance… even if i can barely stand… i’ll find
   the strength to grab your hand… i’ll pick you up, love, if i can… and
   spin you slowly to the band.

   when your body’s feeling weak… and your lips can barely speak… my knees
   will still be weak… from the loveliness i see… you’ll still be my
   beauty queen.

   when you’re missing all of your youth… i will take off both your shoes…
   kiss you like young lovers do… hold you tight under the moon… and make
   you feel like you’re brand new.

   when you think that life is done… i will love you like i’m young… like
   the day has just begun… with no clouds to block the sun… i’ll show you
   that there’s no need to run.

   when you’re crying from the pain… i’ll kiss your head and lay… i’ll cry
   too so you’re not ashamed  …while singing songs we used to play… when
   we were young and on our way.

   when you’re too afraid to die… i will lay down by your side… as i look
   into your eyes… tell you we’re never too old to fly… when you sail to
   the other side… i’m prepared to be your kite.

   [34]love is life and life is pain. it&#8217;s all one in the same. you
   grow tall just to fall and are born just to crawl until someone finds
   warmth in your name. if the way to die is through a tale of time then
   please send me on my way. for kingdom come and the wars that i&#8217;ve
   won were just steps to my cheek on your face. stars they shine if not
   just to remind that to be close is to be far away. so the more that we
   reach is the more that we see that heaven is not just a place. a hand
   is a hand to a fool in a land where love does not apply. for what poor
   skin if it fails to begin to let out what&#8217;s been hiding inside.
   like a light in the night, i still reach for the bright in the form of
   your soul next to mine. so why would i lie you are far too divine for
   this love to be close to blind. some kiss to feel missed like a wish
   towards bliss while others may kiss just to play. but your lips take a
   trip to the gold in my ribs when i meet them with all of my pain. the
   roads that i take like the faith that i taste they will always lead
   straight to you. for if love is life and life is pain then to my chest
   i will beg you to shoot.  -alexander michael

   i love you. i love you means that i&#8217;ll always love you. that i
   loved you then. that i love you now. that i will love you after. i love
   you means i loved you before the word was defined. since before life
   existed. it means that i will love you even when earth is just stardust
   scattering across infinite space. i love you means you are felt and not
   just heard. that you exist both behind my eyes and inside my chest. i

   the world around us in our crossfire. i love you means that we may
   burn… but that we would rather burn than to live without knowing what
   it feels like to be ignited. i love you means i won&#8217;t let go…
   that i was holding on before i knew exactly what i was holding on to. i
   love you means i am prepared to free fall… but never prepared to land.
   i love you means i will never intentionally inflict pain upon
   you&#8230; but if for some reason i ever do.. i will hurt with you
   until it is gone. i love you means there will be no one else. i love
   you means that there never was. i love you means a moment. i love you
   means a lifetime. i love you isn&#8217;t just three simple words&#8230;
