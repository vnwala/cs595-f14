About me

   Boy oh boy, where do I start.
     * I was born on September 2nd 1985, I weighed 7.5 pounds. My parents
       named my Robert. I went to school and did alright, I got mostly B’s
       and C’s. Graduated high school in the 50th percentile. Went to
       college for 4 years, took out student loans and graduated with
       $29,400 of debt. I was very nervous about my future but thankfully
       my job hunt lasted only 4 months. I was fortunate enough to get a
       desk job where I basically look at numbers on a computer screen all
       day. (I love it) I work about 40 hours a week and occasionally work
       overtime on the weekends. I make about $45,000 a year right now and
       I’m very grateful.

     * I live in a decent one story house in a suburban neighborhood,
       there’s a couple oil stains in the driveway from the leaking ’05
       Corolla. I have a wife, and two kids. One boy and one girl,
       and we’re considering having another one. My wife stays home and
       takes care of the kids who aren’t yet in school. We enjoy sitting
       around the house and watching television.

     * My hobbies consist of watching NFL games on sunday afternoons,
       watching television game shows and watching Brad Pitt movies. I
       have a gym membership that I’ve used maybe 4 times in the last
       year. Sometimes my friends will come over and watch TV with me,
       we’ll usually order a pizza from little caesars and drink some
       soda’s. My life is pretty much awesome.

   If there is anything else you’d like to know, please let me know by
