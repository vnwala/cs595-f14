[7]Ending Friendships

   Posted by Javier Adan Rico at [8]4:00 PM on Thursday, May 15, 2014
   The normal way I've experienced with friendships that somehow just
   ended were subtle and painless. Time was a huge factor... with time you
   communicate less, you don't see each other as often then the friendship
   basically ends.
   But then there's those that just ended abruptly. Or they NEED to end
   and you just don't know how to do it so you try to let it fizzle out
   but it doesn't. You then find yourself "faking it" most of the time so
   you seem slightly interested by still distant. Boy was that just the
   dumbest thing I have ever done in my life.
   I let the annoyances get to me bit by bit. Before I knew it, every time
   this person contacted me I cringed. But then I still felt obligated to
   respond with something. Some "thing" was compelling me to just keep
   going with this torture of misleading this guy to keep thinking we're
   friends.
   Needless to say, the torture finally ended. I had enough and I couldn't
   hold it any long. I was snappy, brutally honest and upfront with
   everything I was feeling. I let this poor guy have it. And thus, our
   friendship finally ended.
   All these months wasted, trying to make something work but knew it was
   doomed from the start. Though it wasn't a major event in my life it
   still affected me somehow. I've never done this before to a person I
   used to like... loved.

[18]Impatient bitches

   Posted by Javier Adan Rico at [19]11:03 AM on Tuesday, May 13, 2014
   A frequent theme that I despise has been occurring to me with a
   "friend" of mine but mostly happening to some guys I meet (from
   online/apps or social gatherings) and we're at the beginning phases of
   getting to know each other. If I receive a text and I don't respond
   that exact second after you sent it, it simply means I just haven't
   gotten to your message.
   It doesn't mean I'm bored with you, not interested or think you're
   ugly. Its happened once with a friend that I didn't respond to a
   question until maybe an hour later and assumed I flaked. No, *dumbass*
   I was driving, you assumed incorrectly and jumped to conclusions.
   Some of the boys that I meet and are potential "dates" seem to be very
   impatient in getting responses. Yes, I see I have a few text messages
   on my phone... I'm busy, I'll get to it when I can. But as soon as I
   see what the initial question was, they have already made an entire
   conversation for themselves and assumed my silence meant...
     * A) I am not attracted to you anymore
     * B) I am uninterested because I didn't respond immediately
     * C) I'm bored and purposefully not responding to make you angry

   CALM DOWN YOU IMPATIENT BITCHES!! I don't live off my phone and text
   messages 24/7... I have a life, work, school and I prioritize my shit!
   One good thing has come out of this though, I've learned to take this
   as a major red flag and terminate the conversation and cut out whatever
   itty bitty relationship that was growing. As for the friend that keeps
   doing this, I've already told him to stop being such an impatient/needy
   person with me.... first warning and hopefully the last.

[25]Drunk Texts from the Ex

   Posted by Javier Adan Rico at [26]10:07 AM on Sunday, May 11, 2014
   Need to auto-redirect to a far far faaaaaar away place that I should
   never read or hear from ever again!!
   My ex, drunk (obviously) decides to text me last night a bunch of
   empty, full of shit, love texts that just makes me laugh to no end. I
   don't respond to them but man does it just makes me feel SO MUCH better
   that I ended things. However, the thought of him thinking about me just
   sets me off and I don't know why. It wasn't until he sent this

     "You belong to me.. and no one else"

   is when I just couldn't ignore him any longer and HAD to intervine. I
   know now that it might not have been a good idea but it felt so good
   being very horribly honest in my replies. Oh and at the same time I get
   handful of drunken texts from his best friend that he was with at the
   time.
   You know what's worse than getting drunk texts from you ex at 2am in
   the morning? Drunk texts from his BFF! Drunk texts from 2 fucking
   people at the same time is just the worst!!
   I end this rant by saying that he drove home... DRUNK! Again... it's
   only a matter of time before something horrible happens to him or
   someone else because of his immaturity and blatant stupidity.
