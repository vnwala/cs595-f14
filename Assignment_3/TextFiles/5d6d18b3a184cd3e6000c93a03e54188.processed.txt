           [38]INTRODUCING OUR NEW PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY PROGRAM

                         [39]Carnival Foundation

   Cancer Support Community Greater Miami (CSCGM) is proud to introduce
   our new Pediatric Oncology Pilot Program, presented by [40]Carnival
   Foundation. Please follow the [41]CHILDREN & TEENS PROGRAMS link on
   this page for the latest information on our new and exciting programs
   beginning with our currently established monthly [42]Family Networking
   Group, taking place on the third Saturday of every month.

                                                              [ped-onc3.jpg]

   OUR GOALS:

   1. Help children with cancer process feelings, adapt to stress of their
   illness, skill build and learn through age-appropriate interventions
   including therapeutic play.

   2. Give well siblings an opportunity for safe expression regarding how
   cancer has affected them by providing developmentally appropriate
   support for their needs.

   3. Help parents address their own emotional needs so they can better
   manage the tasks of parenting a child with cancer.

   4. Provide schools with information and resources for responding to the
   needs of children and their families living with cancer.
