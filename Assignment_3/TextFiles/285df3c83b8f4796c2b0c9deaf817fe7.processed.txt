   I write music when I'm inspired. Usually the things I write come to me
   in around 45 minutes in their final version, if at all. I'm interesting
   mainly in the idea of combining old styles with new styles & coming up
   with combinations that I haven't heard before. I've played keyboard
   instruments since I was 14 (26 years ago), so I write primarily for
   piano, harpsichord, clavichord, electric piano, synth, etc... Follow me
   here and at [6]Spacecraf if you like what you hear.
