AMID AMIDI: Publisher/Editor-in-Chief

   Photo by [29]Jazzmine Beaulieu.

Amid Amidi ([30]@amid/[31]LinkedIn) is an author, historian, and consultant.

   I’m the official biographer of Oscar-winning animation director and
   jazz bandleader Ward Kimball, and the youngest recipient of the
   [32]Theatre Library Association Award which I received for the book
   [33]Cartoon Modern: Style and Design in 1950s Animation (2006,
   Chronicle Books).

   I’ve written The Art of Pixar: The Complete Color Scripts and Select
   Art from 25 Years of Animation for Pixar; [34]The Art of Robots for
   20th Century Fox about the making of the Fox/Blue Sky computer animated
   feature Robots; A Sketchy Past: The Art of Peter de Sève; and edited
   and designed the book Inside UPA, a compilation of unpublished
   photographs from the legendary UPA Animation Studios.

   I’ve worked in the animation industry in a number of capacities. For
   four years, I worked for the animation company Spümcø, where I served
   as the production manager of Spumco-LA during the production of Ren &
   Stimpy: Adult Party Cartoon (2002-03). Between 1998 and 2006, I
   published nine print issues of Animation Blast, a publication that
   featured interviews and biographies of numerous animation legends,
   including Iwao Takamoto, Gene Hazelton, Pete Alvarado, Ed Benedict, Tom
   Oreb, Jim Tyer and John Dunn. In 1998, Animation World Magazine hired
   me to become the associate editor of their publication, which was the
   first monthly electronic magazine devoted to animation. On multiple
   occasions, I have served as an expert witness on character and
   production design for DreamWorks Animation.

   Cartoon Brew was launched in March 2004 in partnership with Jerry Beck.
   In September 2008, we launched [35]Cartoon Brew TV, an exclusive
   on-line showcase for the world’s finest contemporary animated shorts. I
   became sole owner of Cartoon Brew in February 2013.

   Where I’ve curated programs or lectured:
     * Klik! Amsterdam Animation Festival (2013, The Netherlands)
     * Ottawa International Animation Festival (2012, 2004, 2002, Canada)
     * Elektra: International Digital Arts Festival (2010, Canada)
     * Anima Mundi (2009, Brazil)
     * Fredrikstad Animation Festival (2008, Norway)
     * Platform International Animation Festival (2007, USA)
     * Projector Festival (2006, Scotland)
     * Walt Disney Animation Studios (USA)
     * Los Angeles Times Festival of Books (2006, USA)
     * Comic-Con International:San Diego (2000-’03, USA)

   Where I’ve been a jury member:
     * Anifilm (2013, Czech Republic)
     * Center for Urban Pedagogy’s Public Access Design Grants (2013, USA)
     * Vimeo Festival (2012, USA)
