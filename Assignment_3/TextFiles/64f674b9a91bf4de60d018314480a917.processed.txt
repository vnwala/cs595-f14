[45]Cuban magic at Latin Jazz Festival 2014

   Posted on [46]September 27, 2014September 27, 2014 by [47]aggatha79
   [48]Eliane Correa @ Pizza Express Jazz Club Soho

   For a lover of latin music, London’s Latin Jazz Festival is
   always great news. On its second year, at [49]Pizza Express Soho Jazz
   Club, the festival runs from 23 Sept – 27 Sept. I went to see Eliane
   Correa & En El Project.

   The show opened with a piano-percussion duo featuring curator Alex
   Wilson on the piano and Venezuelan percussion Master Edwin Sanz which
   built up an amazing atmosphere leading to the sector act. I was already
   enchanted!

   Half Argentinian, half Cuban – Eliane is a very talented musician and
   musical director. The En El Project is a result of Eliane’s
   collaboration with a team of brilliant musicians working in a studio in
   Havana for the last few years. This was the very first live
   performance.

   It was 2 hours of beautiful cuban jazz, mixed with soul, sounds as well
   as Eliane’s interpretation of cuban classics with a jazzy twist. I
   could not get enough. The album is expected in late October and if you
   are into jazz you should definitely check them out.

   I hope London’s Latin Jazz Festival grows stronger and longer!

   And another thing…

   I never understood the concept of having a full blown meal while
   artists are giving their best to perform (and this comes from a Greek
   where music and eating is usually an interwoven experience) unless it
   is a street fiesta or something else of a similar objective. At Pizza
   Express Jazz Club I was trying for the first few songs to focus on the
   music while having to hear people’s cutlery mastering pizza eating. Or
   that time at [50]Boisdale  that I had to sit through the loudness of a
   city bankers group dinner while the focus was the beautiful beats of
   Brazilian artist Monica Vasconcelos.

   Music and especially jazz is to be enjoyed with a fine glass of wine or
   scotch not lamb chops. Venues should really consider putting a time cap
   on the dinner timings so that everybody has a good experience. The
   diners, us, and the musicians.

[71]The ‘Raoul’s’ institution

   Posted on [72]September 21, 2014September 27, 2014 by [73]aggatha79

   It’s a comfort that there are some places in London that offer the same
   ambience, quality of food and service throughout the years without
   messing with ‘forced style’ deco or menu changes. Sometimes you just
   don’t like change. If something really works, why spoil it?
   [74]Raoul’s in Notting Hill is one of them. This is my go to place for
   a hearty brunch, great service and a relaxed neighbourhood atmosphere.
   Located in the heart of Notting Hill, this brasserie style restaurant
   offers dishes based on ingredients of high quality. The fresh fruit
   smoothies is always a winner and breakfast dishes is what most Notting
   Hillers are coming here for in the weekends. The place is quite hidden,
   it is popular amongst the locals (as you really need to know where to
   head to) and this provides quite a serene atmosphere. It never fails to
   get me in a great mood and start of the day. 9 years after my first
   visit, it is still going strong. Have a look at the[75] full list of my
   recommendations for great brunch places in London.

[90]Finding old Shoreditch at Dalston’s Street Feast

   Posted on [91]September 20, 2014September 27, 2014 by [92]aggatha79
   [93]IMG_5628

   I resisted visiting Dalston for a while only because I dislike all this
   hype words of ‘the new x’. I must admit, Dalston is indeed quite close
   to what Shoreditch used to be circa 2005. In reality nothing will ever
   be ‘that’ Shoreditch, with its unpolished yet charming style, lack of
   anything called ‘hipster’ and forever unpretentiousness. But for all of
   us who are reminiscing those good old days, Dalston is as good as it
   can get!
   [94]IMG_5626 Street Feast – Dalston Yard

   [95]Street Feast in Dalston Yard was the reason we made our way East.
   Street Feast is a nomadic night market bringing together restaurants,
   street food pop ups, exotic cocktails and a lot of atmosphere. Street
   food markets is the new craze in London and in the era of the ‘foodie
   trend’ I am quite relieved this craze finally made its way to the
   Capital. Mostly because you don’t have to drag yourself in an expensive
   restaurant, put up with the attitude, to enjoy good quality food and
   end up being tensed for most of the night. Street food markets give you
   this opportunity to enjoy the good food in a relaxed setting and
   actually ‘hang out’. Street food markets is all about the food but it
   isn’t at the same time. It is the new social scene. If you get a chance
   to go make sure you stop by [96]Smokestak (don’t think I’ve ever had as
   good as a pork bun) as well as [97]Rola Wala for imaginative Indian
   street food. I already look forward to the new host venue of Street
   Feast. Will be there!
