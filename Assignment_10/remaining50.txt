What Mattered This Week?16<----->The Supremes held off on the headline cases this week, but decided a bunch of others. Those are important, too!<br /><br />What didn't matter? I'm not sure that what happens to Snowden matters very much, I suppose, although I'm open to arguments the other way.<br /><br />That's what I have. What do you think mattered this week?<----->General
Catch of the Day15<----->Kevin Drum's correspondent<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/06/its-amateur-hour-again-house-representatives"> asked</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">So, I'm just waiting for the inevitable piece from Ron Fournier asking why and how Obama and the Democrats could have let the Farm Bill debacle in the House occur. Or, how this demonstrates a lack of leadership in Washington, particularly by Obama. Or, how the leaderlessness of the White House is infusing into the House through some osmosis-like process and corrupting John Boehner.</blockquote>And the winner is...<a href="http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/21/19074847-first-thoughts-what-the-farm-bills-defeat-tells-us-about-immigrations-chances?lite">NBC's First Read:</a> "Leaderless in Washington: [...]&nbsp;&nbsp;Bottom line: Nobody is really running Washington right now, and the public is noticing."<br /><br />So I got cranky, and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/06/21/no-one-is-ever-really-running-washington-never/">wrote something here</a>&nbsp;about "really running" Washington and separated institutions sharing powers and the rest of it,&nbsp;but I'll add one more thing: no, the public isn't "noticing." Mass publics don't pay attention to squabbles such as the farm bill fiasco; they don't pay attention to who is up and who is down in the estimation of the pundits and reporters; they don't know, and don't care, about most of what people obsess about in Washington. Including those things which are terribly important to to their lives!<br /><br />Granted, if pundits constantly repeat that there's a leadership gap or some such nonsense, there's a chance that people will recognize the phrase and echo it back to pollsters. But for the most part, people just don't care about that stuff.<br /><br />At any rate: Nice catch!<----->Obama
Five Points on Farm Bill/Immigration14<-----><div class="tr_bq">Yesterday, I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/06/20/what-the-farm-bill-says-about-immigration-in-the-house/">wrote</a> over at PP about "What the Farm Bill says about immigration in the House." I've already linked to Greg, who had a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/06/20/farm-bill-debacle-shows-john-boehner-needs-nancy-pelosi/">similar view</a>, and there were others, too.&nbsp;</div><br />But Ezra Klein has a<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/21/wonkbook-the-farm-bill-fail-doesnt-mean-immigration-reform-is-doomed/"> bit of a counterintuitive view</a> this morning:<br /><blockquote>Ill admit it: I dont know what the collapse of the farm bill portends for immigration reform. But I suspect the answer is: not much.<br />[...]<br />Will immigration go the same way? Perhaps. But its not a sure thing, either. Theres not going to be an immigration bill that all House Republicans are happy with. And theyre not going to pass an immigration bill because Boehner begs and pleads. But they might, in the end, pass an immigration bill  or allow one to be passed  because they trust the basic strategy.<br /><br />Thats not just the difference between immigration and the farm bill. Its the difference between immigration and everything. Washington is acting surprised that Boehner cant control his members. But we knew that already  remember Plan B? If youre surprised that the House is a mess, you simply havent been paying attention.</blockquote>I think there are a few quick points to be made here.<br /><br />1. He's correct that we're not getting new information here. We knew "the House is a mess." All we had here is yet another example. So in that sense, it's fair to say that close observers of the House don't really have anything new to say after the farm bill. It's less "What the Farm Bill says about immigration in the House" than "What the Farm Bill says about immigration in the House -- if you were just tuning in." Of course, lots of people are just tuning in!<br /><br />2. &nbsp;I don't think it's correct to say that there's a "difference between immigration and everything." Specifically, I don't think it's correct to say that House Republicans don't care about passing a farm bill. Yes, they may be post-policy, but the farm bill? I would think that a lot of them want that to pass.<br /><br />3. Which gets to an important point: it's one thing to say, as I've been saying that it may be the case on immigration that mainstream conservatives want the bill to pass but without their votes; it's another thing to solve that coordination problem. The same applies if their goal is to get something to committee and then let it die; there's still a coordination problem in actually getting that done.<br /><br />4. By the way: yesterday's fiasco notwithstanding, there's still every possibility that we'll still get a farm bill this year. It wouldn't be the first time something collapsed on the floor only to be revived.<br /><br />5. To the extent that the farm bill and immigration have any causal pull on each other, it may well be the other way around: if Boehner thinks he's eventually going to have to pass the Senate bill on immigration with mostly Democratic votes, he may be more reluctant to pass the Senate farm bill the same way. That's assuming the Senate version of the farm bill wouldn't get bipartisan majorities; it receive a fair number of Republican votes in the Senate, but short of a majority.<br /><br />And once again: I still have no idea what House Republicans actually want to do on immigration. They may well want to kill it. We'll just have to see.<----->Obama

Tuesday, or Not?<----->One of the biggest surprises to me recently has been the emergence of National Review as a location for some quality reporting on Republicans. I've thought of NRO as mostly a cheerleader site, but with Robert Costa taking the lead, it's now becoming a place to get information beyond what today's talking points happen to be. That's good!<br /><br />That said...I'm more than a little confused about <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/351534/tuesday-group-still-lives-jonathan-strong">today's item</a>, from Jonathan Strong, claiming that "The Tuesday Group, a moderate-Republican caucus long ignored within the House GOP, is quietly starting to fight back against the conferences right turn."<br /><br />The problem? There's really no evidence that House moderates are having any effect at all. In the article, I mean. Typical anecdote:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Tuesday Group members will get up in a [meeting of the Republican caucus] and express a point of view and basically, the leaders listen to them, but everybody else sort of tunes out, said former representative Steven LaTourette of Ohio, now the president of the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership.</blockquote>It goes on like that, reporting on several recent skirmishes that the moderates lost; there's really nothing at all about any successes.<br /><br />So what's the deal here? Strong noticed the existence of the Tuesday Group, thought there might be a story there, reported it out and found nothing but was already committed to a point of view? Some unexpected editorial decision from NR to show tolerance by throwing a bone to moderates? There really is some sort of resurgence of the moderates -- who, after all, have just as much ability to sink a GOP-only bill in the House as the Gohmert-Bachmann group -- but Strong didn't quite come up with the stories to convince us?<br /><br />I'll admit: I'm puzzled. Interested, but puzzled.<----->Conservatives
The Future of the Real IRS Scandal!12<----->I saw this from <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/06/conspiracy-theory-update-irs-stole-election-mitt-romney">Kevin Drum</a>, who sent me to <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/06/20/irs_scandal_bizarre_theory_asks_whether_the_tea_party_targeting_moved_millions.html">Dave Weigel</a>, and from there to a brilliant paper designed to fuel infinite resentment for conservatives, summarized by&nbsp;James Pethokoukis <a href="http://www.aei.org/article/economics/yes-irs-harassment-blunted-the-tea-party-ground-game/">beginning with this gem</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">1. Lets say Tea Party groups had continued to grow at the pace seen in 2009 and 2010.</blockquote>And ending with the conclusion that the Democrats stole the 2012 election by suppressing the Tea Party vote by foot-dragging on certifying their tax-exempt status.<br /><br />To which my first reaction is: that's nothing! Of course we should assume that Tea Party groups would naturally group in Years Three and Four the way they grew in Years One and Two. And we should further assume that they should grow in Years Five and Six at that same rate, too -- so we're probably talking about them pretty much reaching 60% of the electorate by 2014, and 80% by 2016, and well over 200% of the electorate by the 2020 elections. Of course that's what we should assume! By that logic, it's pretty obvious that by the end of the decade Republicans would have easily had at least 90 Senators and 400 Members of the House, not to mention well over 450 electoral votes in the presidential elections. Anything else is clear evidence of stolen elections!<br /><br />And of course that was only stifled by the insidious IRS plot. Never mind, as Weigel notes, that the real heavy Tea Party lifting was by already-established tax-exempts; never mind also, as Drum notes, that back in the real world the Tea Party was never very popular outside of the Republican core and, by 2011, was quite unpopular with most voters. All that would have been totally completely different if a whole bunch of small, local, groups had been properly equipped with prompt approval of their tax status.<br /><br />At any rate, my other favorite part of this particular conspiracy is <a href="http://www.aei.org/article/economics/yes-irs-harassment-blunted-the-tea-party-ground-game/">this from one of the study's coauthors</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The Tea Party movements huge success was not the result of a few days of work by an elected official or two, but involved activists all over the country who spent the year and a half leading up to the midterm elections volunteering, organizing, donating, and rallying. Much of these grassroots activities were centered around 501(c)4s, which according to our research were an important component of the Tea Party movement and its rise.  Unfortunately for Republicans, the IRS slowed Tea Party growth before the 2012 election.</blockquote>Got it? The complaint is that the IRS was slow in granting all these groups a tax status that depending on them not being primarily devoting to electioneering, thus preventing them from..."volunteering, organizing, donating, and rallying" for the "midterm elections."<br /><br />I mean, as far as I can see (and I only read co-author Stan Veuger's summary post, not the whole paper) the entire thing is premised on a "constitutional right" for these groups to get tax-exempt status so that they can do things they aren't supposed to do with that tax-exempt status. And there's not even a pause to explain why some might see something amiss in that.<br /><br />As I've been saying for some time: they're not even trying.<----->Obama

June 19, 1973-10<----->Everyone is still waiting for John Dean's public testimony to the Senate Watergate Committee, postponed now until later in the month.<br /><br /><a name="more"></a><br /><br />The conversations in the Oval Office are less newsy now; Richard Nixon is no longer talking to his co-conspirators, but to a new staff who (as far as we know) don't realize how involved he was in the cover-up and the White House horrors before that. Typically, Nixon proclaims his innocence, and rails against Dean, or against Archibald Cox. This morning, he meets with Haig, Ziegler, and Buzhardt, who is essentially acting as his lead defense attorney.<br /><br />--<br /><br />President Nixon: [...] One thing I was, noted this morning was that, oh, that fucking shocking statement by Scott, I mean Cox. Good God, that, uh, now look here [...] But that was an ugly shocking thing.<br /><br />Haig: It really was.<br /><br />President Nixon: Because, first, it's wrong, as far as the Constitution; it's partisan...[C]an the President be subpoenaed or indicted, Jesus Christ, he knows better than that....Well, he's highly partisan.<br /><br />Buzhardt: He's a highly partisan fella and he's gonna play it political.<br /><br />President Nixon: Yeah.<br /><br />Buzhardt: Because he knows he can't subpoena the President; he knows he can't indict the President; but he's gonna play this game quite opposite.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Buzhardt: ...[H]e [Elliot Richardson] cannot allow this fella, for the sake of everybody in government, to think that this fella has a hunting license as a Kennedy advocate to go after Republicans any way he can, and the President in particular. ... [After the Ervin hearings conclude], then we meet him [Cox] head-on. And we just blast the fire out of him. That's the only thing we can do. But if we come out of the hearings in good shape, and I believe we will, and the public's gonna be fed up with it at that point. I think, I think at that point, Mr. Cox is gonna reach the point where he's gonna have a very difficult time getting the press to attend his press conferences. It's just not gonna be that kind of news. It's all gonna be re-hash and by that time, I hope we'll have the Committee with enough information on Democrat financing...<br /><br />President Nixon: I wouldn't anticipate it that much. [...]<br /><br />--<br /><br />And more false bravado:<br /><br />--<br /><br />Buzhardt: If he [Howard Baker] sees that Dean is beginning to crumble, if he sees that he's beginning to look bad, then, yes, I anticipate he'll jump on with both feet...I'm convinced that [Dean will]...convict himself.<br /><br />President Nixon: Really?<br /><br />Buzhardt: Yes, sir. As a lar, and we'll give him all the help we can.<br /><br />President Nixon: As a lar, huh.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Buzhardt and Haig at this point are putting their hopes on Dean's weaknesses, particularly a story in the press about Dean "borrowing" $14,000 from the campaign for personal expenses, leaving an IOU in a safe but without telling anyone. The problem is that Buzhardt and Haig believe that Dean's main story will be full of lies, because Nixon has told them that; the president, however, knows that Dean can be devastating while sticking to the truth. Meanwhile, Buzhardt is preparing questions for committee minority counsel Fred Thompson, for the Republicans to use to cross-examine Dean. But Howard Baker isn't acting as a solid partisan ally, which means the committee as a whole is badly slanted against Nixon.<br /><br />Realistically, however, there's just very little they can do at this point, other than to assume that whatever people think of Richard Nixon and John Dean, if it ultimately comes down to choosing who to believe then no one is going to want to bring down the President of the United States based on one man's claims without proof. And of those still in the White House, only the president knows that Dean is telling the truth -- and there is firm evidence to prove it.<----->Liberals
Today's Lesson in Why One Shouldn't Trust Self-Identified "Independents"<-----><div class="tr_bq"><a href="http://politicalwire.com/archives/2013/06/19/extra_bonus_quote_of_the_day.html">Sean Hannity</a>: "I'm not a Republican, though people often mistake me for one."</div><br />(From Political Wire, quoted from a Playboy interview I'm not going to click through to read).<br /><br />Or, <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/2009/12/17/three_myths_about_political_in/">to quote John Sides</a>:<br /><blockquote>The three myths [about independents] are:<br /><br />1) Independents are the largest partisan group.<br /><br />2) Independents are actually independent.<br /><br />3) Change in the opinions of independents is always consequential.</blockquote>Sean Hannity is perfectly free to call himself whatever he wants. But he is obviously a functional Republican.<br /><br />Keep this in mind the next time someone tells you about how independents are a huge group of voters. For whatever reason, our political culture values calling oneself "independent," and discourages people from identifying themselves as party regulars -- if you ask people whether they vote the candidate or the party, an overwhelming majority will go with "candidate."<br /><br />Our political behavior, on the other hand, demonstrates considerably partisan behavior -- most of us, most of the time, do in fact for party, not candidate.<br /><br />All of which is not only very familiar to anyone who has studied the evidence, but should be obvious to anyone who listens to political actors talk.<br /><br />A reminder of my good-enough way of thinking about how the actual electorate breaks down: it's one-third Republican, one-third Democratic, one-third independent...but that final one third is itself really one-third Republican, one-third Democratic, and one-third (and thus one-ninth overall) true independent. And what's more, those true independents are overwhelmingly the least informed and least attentive to politics; the stereotyped careful independent who carefully reads up on the issues and the candidates in order to make up her mind does exist, but she's a tiny, tiny, party of the electorate (I've never seen numbers, but I'm guessing some fraction of one percent).<----->Liberals
No One Cares About the Deficit, Latest Chapter<----->The CBO says: <a href="http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/44346-Immigration.pdf">the Senate immigration bill lowers the deficit</a>&nbsp;(see also a <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/06/19/cbo_score_of_immigration_bill.html">nice explainer</a> from pro-immigration analyst Matt Yglesias).<br /><br />Liberals who support immigration reform have been having fun since yesterday afternoon pointing out that Republicans who oppose immigration are hypocrites because they will surely ignore or dismiss that effect on what is supposedly one of their main priorities. Well, yes -- but I have very little problem with hypocrisy in general, and even less on this "gotcha" kind. Truth is that immigration policy is terribly important to determining what kind of nation you're going to have; if it increases or decreases the deficit a bit, that's really no reason to support or oppose the policy. And $200B or so over ten years is really nothing to get all excited about. It's more the other way around: anyone who claims to care about deficits would have some obligation to change the bill if the estimates had come back the other way; finding that there's a bit of deficit reduction certainly doesn't oblige people otherwise concerned about deficits to support the bill.<br /><br />Ah, but there's one group which really should weigh in: the professional deficit scolds. Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, for example. That is, they should weigh in if they really want people to take them seriously.<br /><br />First of all, they (and anyone else whose primary political project is deficit reduction) should be out there backing up the CBO estimates. It's not their job to say that anyone who cares about deficit reduction should vote for the immigration bill, but it is their job -- if they really care about deficit reduction -- to do whatever they can to establish the idea that CBO projections are real, and should be treated as real.<br /><br />(That's assuming, of course, that they agree with CBO; if not, it's their obligation to do a serious nonpartisan critique).<br /><br />Second, they should be quick to praise those who propose major legislation that helps the deficit. Not the bill itself; again, even deficit scolds shouldn't be suggesting that people support or oppose major substantive legislation because of relatively minor deficit reduction. But there's little reward out there for what deficit scolds certainly should be thinking of as acting responsibly -- the difference, in other words, between Bush-era Medicare expansion and Obama-era ACA. Indeed, that could be especially helpful for deficit-scolds who oppose a bill: "I'm against this, but the authors deserve considerable credit for doing it in a fiscally responsible way."<br /><br />In fact, however, most deficit scolds typically do no such thing. Which is why no one should take most of them seriously on deficits. And why many who otherwise would be sympathetic to their supposed cause wind up thinking that their real goals have little to do with deficits and debt.<----->Liberals

Politico? Why Not?<----->There's an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/113489/john-f-harris-jim-vandehei-interview-talking-politicos-editors">interview</a> of Politico's maestros over at TNR which, to tell the truth, I haven't read yet, but it's causing a bit of a fuss -- Politico and the normally sensible Nate Silver are <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/nate-silver-politico-co-founders-lack-curiosity-for">feuding a bit</a>, for example, mainly (as far as I can tell) because Politico likes to take silly swipes at Silver.<br /><br />But at any rate, I like<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2013_06/for_those_who_cant_get_enough045338.php"> what Ed Kilgore says about Politico</a> (his emphasis):<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Regular readers know that Im not a Politico-hater; I think the site serves a legitimate reporting function and sometimes does it well and other times at least covers a lot of landscape that might otherwise escape attention. Its when Politico tells us <i>what it all means</i> or tries self-consciously to <i>drive narratives</i> that it gets into trouble, often to the point of self-parody.</blockquote>Silver is upset that Politico's style "seem to lack very much curiosity for the world outside of the bubble." I disagree! Kilgore is correct here: what they can do, and sometimes do extremely well, is to let us know what insiders are thinking and doing. That's good enough.<br /><br />Moreover, careful readers can often ignore the "what it all means" nonsense.The only thing I do worry about is when reporters, whether Politico or elsewhere, put that "what it all means" junk into the mouths of insiders who really are just worried about how to get from point A to point B. But if it's the insiders themselves who believe hocus-pocus and flim-flam, well, it's helpful to know that.<br /><br />I'll go back to one of my favorite things -- that the McLaughlin Group promised (or perhaps still promises) "inside opinions and forecasts," and delivered exactly that. Not wise opinions or accurate forecasts -- but they didn't promise those!<br /><br />I'll tie this all back to immigration...right now I've been arguing the key to immigration is whether mainstream conservatives in the House want it to pass, and that will depend on how they balance out what's good for the party and what's good for them personally. For that, I'd much rather know what Republicans perceive about the electoral effects of passing immigration reform, rather than a good study by a political scientist about the <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/2013/06/16/do-anti-immigration-stances-cost-the-gop-votes-from-latinos/">actual effects of immigration reform</a>. And since I'm a careful reader, I don't really care whether reporters mistake House GOP perceptions for reality -- because for this particular question, I want to be in the heads of those Members, and I'm perfectly capable of removing myself from that if I have some other question I want to answer.<br /><br />Again, as long as they keep their own analysis out of the helpful information they are collecting, I'm all for Politco-style reporting. I'm pretty sure the result is that we know a fair amount more than we used to about what's going on in Washington, and that's a plus -- no matter how much nonsense we have to ignore to get to it.<----->Conservatives
Please, More Reporting Like This (Judges ed.)<----->Fascinating parenthetical in Emily Heil's <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/post/senate-finds-pace-on-judicial-nominees/2013/06/18/fe9c5b56-d75b-11e2-a9f2-42ee3912ae0e_blog.html">story about judicial vacancies</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Some vacancies have remained without nominees because home-state senators have yet to make recommendations to the White House to begin with  and in states with two GOP senators, that means they can delay the process there. (However, we hear that President Obama has sufficiently badgered at least Democratic senators to start providing names of judges, and observers are expecting a raft of new names from the White House soon.)</blockquote>First, it's good reporting to note the Senate's role in the delays in judicial nominations at the very beginning of the process.<br /><br />But what's this about Democratic Senators? We know (or at least we think we know) that Republican Senators have been slow-walking nominations in their states, but the general sense I've had is that the delays in Democratic states have been the administration's fault. Here, it's posed as the fault of Democratic Senators -- at least recently. Is that true?<br /><br />One way to look at it is that it's fair to blame Obama up to the point that he makes it clear that he's doing whatever he can; that is, if he hasn't been "sufficiently badgering" in public, we know he hasn't done everything he can do. But overall, it's hard to tell! So, good reporting here, but more, please.<br /><br />Oh - and that "raft" of new names? Seems like we've been hearing that all year, which makes me more inclined to think that the whole paragraph is mainly WH spin. Of course, we eventually did get the three DC Circuit picks, so you never know.<----->general

Breaking: Boehner Is Constrained By His Conference.<----->There's a lot of nonsense on the "Hastert Rule" going around, and a lot of nonsense on John Boehner as a "weak" Speaker.<br /><br />I've talked about many times, but here's the short version:<br /><br />There's just no way that a Speaker is going to habitually do things that his conference doesn't want. Any Speaker who did that wouldn't last very long at all. A Speaker isn't "weak" because he's constrained that way; Nancy Pelosi was equally constrained by her caucus, and so were Jim Wright and Newt Gingrich, and so are all of them.<br /><br />That doesn't need to be incorporated into any formal rule; it's just how it is.<br /><br />What's more, just as partisan context needs to be included to assess how a president is doing with Congress, so does the partisan context need to be included if we are interested in assessing a Speaker's performance. The larger, and the more unified, the majority party, the easier it is for the Speaker to appear "strong." But that's not the Speaker's strength; it's just a function of a large, unified majority. Tip O'Neill didn't suddenly get better at being Speaker in 1983; he just had a liberal majority that wasn't available in 1981-1982.<br /><br />There are variations beyond simple majority size and unity. Newt Gingrich and Jim Wright both alienated Members who didn't like their bullying style (and, in the case of Gingrich, his poor negotiating record with the Clinton White House). O'Neill, Pelosi, and (I believe) Boehner have been particularly good at listening to their Members, and moving the agenda towards consensus positions when they can. But no Speaker simply dictates to co-equal Members of the House what to do, and John Boehner isn't unusually weak because he can't or won't do so.<----->Conservatives
Nuclear Logic (Why Lautenberg Probably Doesn't Matter)<----->Greg has some reporting out today on the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/06/17/do-senate-dems-have-the-votes-for-the-nuclear-option/">concerns among Senate Democrats</a> that Frank Lautenberg's death &nbsp;may tip things against majority-imposed reform; with several Democratic defections possible and at least a couple likely, losing that one sure vote for reform could be the difference.<br /><br />I don't question his reporting -- that is, I'm sure that Democrats are saying what he reports they're saying -- but I don't really believe it. I continue to believe it's highly unlikely that the Democrats will act unless they're very close to being unanimous. One defection, maybe; two, perhaps; more, and I don't think anything happens.<br /><br />That's in part because of the spin on it; I think a lot of Democrats are likely worried that a narrow vote with every Republican and a four (or, previously, five) Democrats opposing reform would mean that they'll lose the spin battle. I think that's probably a foolish reason; it won't really matter who wins the fight over whether majority-imposed reform is "good government" or "majority tyranny." No one cares about Senate procedure; &nbsp;most of the press will forget about it in a couple of weeks, and voters will never have noticed.<br /><br />(Caveat: it's certainly possible that the conservative information loop will find majority-imposed reform to be a product that sells, but that just means it's substituting for some other product; it won't affect votes in 2014 or 2106).<br /><br />However, it's also in part because I don't really think that the most reluctant Democrats are acting independently. I think quite a few Democrats are reluctant to change the rules. The balance here is between the incentives for them as individual Senators to retain their individual influence within the Senate and the incentives for them as Democrats to advance the party agenda. What determines the balance isn't so much individual variation among Democrats, but the level of GOP obstruction. My strong suspicion here is that there will either be 52 or more votes (out of the 54), or there will be well under 50.<br /><br />The tricky part is that no one wants to specify exactly how many and which positions Republicans would have to obstruct in order to trigger that 52+ number, since doing so would give them license to block everything up to that line. What's more, I'm not convinced that any of the Democrats, including Harry Reid, have a precise formula in mind. Instead, I think they'll work it out together, based on what Republicans do, what Democratic party actors do, and perhaps to a small extent what Barack Obama does. But I do think that it's going to be more of a collective decision than a set of separate individual decisions.<br /><br />Oh, and I think some sort of bipartisan efforts to avert majority-imposed reform is fairly likely.<br /><br />No prediction from me on the outcome of any of this. And I'm an outsider here; the reporting could well be more correct than my outsider analysis. But that's how I see the incentives involved.<----->Liberals
Finding a House Majority on Immigration<----->The news on immigration today is <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/john-boehner-wont-back-immigration-bill-without-majority-gop-support/article/2531983">John Boehner rejecting the option of passing a bill with mostly Democratic votes.</a> Or so he says; Jonathan Chait <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/06/gaffe-that-threatens-immigration-reform.html">points out</a> that Boehner's position makes him prone to bluffing. But for now:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"I just don't think that's the winning formula here," Cole told The Washington Examiner. "What the speaker wants to do is have a hopefully bipartisan product -- certainly one that has the majority of Republicans -- pass the House. This has got too much emotional, political impact and I think it really has to be genuinely bipartisan."</blockquote>I'm sure that the Speaker wants a "bipartisan product."<br /><br />I just don't see how it happens.<br /><br />As Greg Sargent <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/06/17/the-morning-plum-marco-rubios-epic-challenge-on-immigration/">explains</a> today, there's really "no papering over" the key question: is there a (real) path to citizenship, or not?<br /><br />If there is, then it's virtually certain that the majority of House Republicans will oppose. If not, it's virtually certain that an overwhelming majority of House Democrats will oppose.<br /><br />That, it seems to me, is obvious and easy. The more complicated question is whether there's any House majority at all behind anything.<br /><br />Is there a GOP-only majority? I really doubt it. There are 234 Republicans right now, so if they lose more than 16 they will need help from the Democrats. It's possible that the whole GOP conference can be rallied to support something, but it's clearly hard work. I'm pretty convinced that there are at least 20 Republicans who would only support immigration-bashing measures, and also at least 20 Republicans who are pro-immigration. As far as I can tell, the only way something gets 218 Republicans is if they wind up putting the value of proving they can pass something ahead of their policy positions, and I'm not sure why they would want to do that.<br /><br />What about a mostly-Republican bill? I'd love to see some reporting on where the remaining "Blue Dog" Democrats are on this. It seems (at least based on what we're seeing in the Senate) that most or all of them would support a comprehensive bill, but they could support, say, a border-security-only bill and still say they were for comprehensive reform. On the other hand, they would be getting on the wrong side of Latino groups -- and, remember, the wrong side of business. My guess, and it's completely just a guess, is that it's going to be very, very difficult to find a mostly-Republicans majority.<br /><br />In other words, the reason I've been saying that Boehner would eventually have to decide whether to move bill with mostly Democratic votes is because I don't really think he has another option. Not just for something that could become law, but for anything to get through the House at all.<br /><br />That could be wrong! A GOP-only bill is possible if Republicans agree to ignore their policy preferences for a while in order to get the "narrative" victory of passing something. A GOP-mostly bill is possible if a fair number of Democrats who would vote for a comprehensive bill would also vote for a GOP-written bill without citizenship. I don't think those votes are there, but I could easily be wrong about it. Note, however, that even if they are, that just gets something to conference...actually getting something enacted into law just gets them back to the original question, because it's pretty certain that nothing becomes law without citizenship. And, once again, most Republicans are not going to vote for citizenship.<br /><br />All of which gets back to my initial sense that the question is all about whether House Republicans want a comprehensive bill to become law, or not. If not, Boehner won't bring it up, and it's dead. If so, Boehner will bring it up, and it probably has the votes (with, that is, a fairly large group quietly wanting that solution even as they vote against it and very likely denounce Boehner publicly for doing what they want him to do).<----->Conservatives

June 16, 1973<----->The Ervin Committee hearings have been continuing. The most important witness so far has been Jeb Magruder, but at this point everyone is waiting for John Dean. On the 16th, Dean does his pre-testimony in a closed session. That was the standard committee procedure, but Dean had resisted -- he and his lawyers wanted to stage manage his own testimony, and the executive session ran the risk that his bombshells would be leaked according to someone else's agenda.<br /><br />Dean was supposed to begin his public, televised testimony during the week of June 18th, but Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet leader, was in the US, and the Watergate Committee agreed to delay until after the Brezhnev-Nixon summit was completed.<br /><br />Behind the scenes, perhaps the most important thing in this period is that the White House and Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox are already beginning to build to a confrontation.<br /><br />Emery makes much of Dean's closed door testimony -- Dean brandished Howard Baker's secret meeting with Nixon, presumably to pressure Baker to play nice in the public sessions (or else Dean would imply that Baker was in the pocket of the White House).<br /><br />And no one wants that. In early June, Nixon's Gallup approval stayed at the same 44% he had been at in mid-May. It's not disaster-level, but his time as a popular president is very much over.<----->General

It's the second election day of the year, and second of the two and four year cycles; I've only had three choices, total, to make so far.

The Anti-Quagmire President (So Far)<----->On Obama and Syria: the one area of national security and foreign policy in which Barack Obama really has earned the benefit of the doubt is about slippery slopes, quagmires, and otherwise getting trapped into military adventurism that expands despite everyone's best intentions.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>His record on this is really quite impressive. He got out of Iraq (yes, he was only following George W. Bush's policy and a signed agreement with the Iraqis, but it wouldn't have been the first time a president managed to keep troops where they weren't really wanted). His intervention in Libya was limited and stayed limited. In Mali, Yemen, and other conflicts, he committed to a minimal level of action and stuck with it. And in Afghanistan, he "surged" -- but then de-escalated and appears to be on a path to continue getting out. At no point that I remember did the Obama Administration give in to the kinds of "in for a dime, in for a dollar" arguments that wind up leading to real messes. The administration has consistently been willing to absorb predictable attacks for bugging out too early or for doing too little.</div><div><br /></div><div>Perhaps Syria will turn out different -- and those who oppose intervention there (or I suppose those who support the current level of intervention but oppose any further action) should obviously be advocating for what they want rather than just trusting Obama. But overall...he hasn't earned anyone's trust on civil liberties or open government, and he's made his share of foreign policy/national security blunders, but he might be the best since Ike at knowing how to keep engagements limited.</div><----->Obama

I mean, we're right to laugh about it, but we also know that Republicans do seem perfectly willing to pretend that Newt is a Wise Man of Conservatives, when they actually know that he's not only not wise, but not particularly committed to being conservative, either.<br /><br />At any rate: Nice catch!<----->Conservatives

ENDA May Have a Chance<----->Here's how fast things are changing on issues affecting sexual orientation and gender identity: there's actually a realistic chance that the Employment Non-Discrimination Act could pass the divided Congress. And it seems very likely that at the very least, Democrats will push it &nbsp;aggressively.<br /><br />That was the word from Harry Reid earlier this week, when he promised that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/10/harry-reid-enda_n_3417653.html">the Senate would take up the legislation "soon,"</a> although he didn't specify when. And now Barack Obama <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/06/13/is-this-the-year-to-end-anti-gay-workplace-discrimination/">may be planning to push it himself</a>. It's no surprise; the current bill has 48 co-sponsors; that's three more than the version which died in the 111th Congress (2009-2010), even though that Senate had more Democrats. Over in the House, &nbsp;the companion legislation has 175 cosponsors.<br /><br />One would expect that the bill would have no chance in the Republican House, but I'm not so sure; it's not impossible that this could wind up being like the Violence Against Women Act, something so difficult to explain opposing that the House would rather just let it pass than stand in the way. ENDA <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2011/06/02/9716/polls-show-huge-public-support-for-gay-and-transgender-workplace-protections/">polls extremely well</a>, with many Americans surprised that employers can fire people based on non-work factors absent of specific laws prohibiting it. I'm never sure how seriously to take that kind of polling, but I can really imagine a lot of Republican Senators being reluctant to filibuster the bill -- and it's even possible to imagine House Republicans wanting to make the bill go away by having John Boehner bring it to the floor for passage (even while they vote against it in order to protect against primary challengers).<br /><br />No predictions. Just taking note of what really is an amazing change -- that ENDA could have reached the status of motherhood and apple pie (and VAWA) to the extent that politicians may actually fear stopping it.<----->General
How Soon Tax Reform?<----->Earlier this week, Stan Collender wrote a longish piece about <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/stan-collender/2743/no-tax-reform-end-decade">the prospects for tax reform</a>. His bottom line? Don't expect anything until 2017.<br /><br />He makes several points, most of which I agree with. But I'm not sure I agree with the conclusion. In particular, Collender argues, essentially, that tax reform will happen only when Republicans give in to the Democratic position that reform should be revenue-positive this time around, as opposed to the revenue-neutral 1986 effort.<br /><br />I strongly disagree with that -- as I've argued in the past, I think tax reform is really only plausible when it's revenue-neutral. Why? Because tax reform by its nature is all about overcoming well-organized, generally influential losers by putting together a coalition of marginal winners. That only works if the end product is essentially an overall net winner (because it increases economic efficiency). Use it to raise revenues, and you lose most or all of that. That's one way to look at it; another is that it's not plausible that a revenue-raising bill of any kind will attract very many Republican votes in the foreseeable future, which means that the votes just aren't going to be there.<br /><br />Because of that, I'd say that the recent reductions in the deficit -- and more importantly, the recent reductions in everyone's focus on the deficit, along with the at least partial demise of "grand bargain" talk -- is extremely good news for tax reform. It still doesn't make it easy, or likely, but I think the only chance for tax reform is to decouple it from deficits and grand bargains. Indeed, that's what happened in the 1980s; tax reform was (as far as I remember) placed on a completely different track from Gramm-Rudman and other deficit-cutting efforts.<br /><br />The other thing I'd say about tax reform is that it's no surprise that it's rising to the top of the agenda during a second term of a presidency and during divided government. Regardless of what House Republicans are saying right now, tax reform is never at the top of any party's agenda -- for example, Ed Kilgore makes the sensible point that <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2013_06/forget_about_bipartisan_tax_re045235.php">the IRS scandal could revive GOP flat tax mania</a>, making "normal" tax reform that much less possible. A new presidency brings a new agenda, and tax reform is unlikely to be near the top. Especially if there's another round of unified government.<br /><br />So while I agree with Collender about all the reasons that tax reform is difficult at best over the next three years, I think this is still the real window; if it doesn't happen now, it's likely not to happen for a while.<----->Liberals

One Small Point for a Plain Blog Theory<-----><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/town-meeting-obamacare-92604.html">A "townhall" meeting in Maryland about the Affordable Care Act</a>&nbsp;(my emphasis):<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">But politics  so entwined with the health law in Washington  barely came up in the 90-minute discussion. <i>The term Obamacare was not uttered</i>. Neither was Democrat nor Republican. The only mention of the president was during a brief history of the laws passage.<br /><br />The only political comment came from a senior citizen who said that he likes some pieces of the law  the age 26 provision and pre-existing condition coverage  but demanded to know if people realize that it also raises taxes.</blockquote>Hey, it's one meeting, one report of one meeting, who knows. But <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-future-of-obamacare-again.html">here's what I said</a> (last summer, but I've been saying it from the start):<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">If ACA survives and is implemented and basically works, then it will eventually lose its name...any name. The exchanges will be called whatever they're called, and the various other pieces of it may have names (so we'll have the IPAB), but most people and even most politicians won't associate that stuff with the ACA or Obamacare. No one will think to call Medicaid expansion anything; it'll just be how Medicaid is. No one will have a name for the subsidies, any more than we have a legislative name for the mortgage interest tax subsidy. We'll have serious mistakes, too: people won't remember what was ACA and what was previous policy and what was in subsequent legislation.</blockquote>Is this the first step on the road to ACA becoming invisible?

As John sums it up,&nbsp;Jeffery Mondak and Jon Hurwitz found:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">For civil libertarians dismayed at many (most?) Americans willingness to accept an expanded national security state, the problem may lie not so much with the threat of terrorism, but with a general failure to defend civil liberties.</blockquote>That's worth knowing; terrorism isn't a special case, but part of a more general lack of commitment to civil liberties.<br /><br />That's generally a pretty big problem for the small group (and I'm in that group) who really do consider civil liberties a priority. Basically, you can get lip service support, but it's not deep at all, and for many it doesn't take much to get to where the trade-offs are worth it.<br /><br />What's more, the incentives for politicians are asymmetrical in a way that biases against civil liberties. That is: the downside of an incremental loss of civil liberties isn't ever going to be very large. But the downside, or at least the perceived downside, of insisting on civil liberties at the expense of some competing value is almost always going to be lopsided in favor of the other value.<br /><br />And unfortunately, I don't think it's a problem that can be solved. About the best we can hope for is either luck of the draw with politicians who just happen to care about these issues, or, more likely, the courts stepping in.<br /><br />At any rate: nice catch!<----->Liberals
Congress Gags Itself<----->I like this Kevin Drum item <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/06/watching-watchmen-nsa-edition">on NSA and oversight</a>, but it repeats something which I think shouldn't be accepted so easily by everyone:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The traditional method of oversight is via congressional committees and the court system. But even if you assume that intelligence organizations are reporting their activities honestly, those don't really work anymore. Once a program is in place, courts end up rubber stamping virtually every application and congressional committees do pretty much the same. They simply become too accustomed to what's going on to truly pay attention. And in the case of Congress, even if some members do have issues, they're all but gagged from speaking out about them.</blockquote>Congress is gagged, yes -- but because they allow themselves to be gagged. It's not inherently up to the bureaucracy or the president to set the rules about secrecy. Congress can do that. And they do, either explicitly or implicitly.<br /><br />Granted: both the president and the bureaucracy can fight for the rules they prefer, too. But Congress, when they really want to do something, have plenty of tools to make it happen.<br /><br />The reality here is that Members of Congress, with only a few exceptions, have been perfectly happy to gag themselves. To some extent that's because they approved of policies they didn't want publicity about, perhaps because they believe publicity would harm the consensus for those policies. To some extent it probably is because they are concerned about actual national security damage if secrets were publicized; that can be sincere even if it's wrong. But to a large extent, it's probably because pretending that they have no ability to do anything -- they can't even talk about it! -- is a very nice way of ducking responsibility.<br /><br />I wrote something over the weekend saying that those upset about the NSA stories should be <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/06/08/blame_congress_for_the_nsas_overreach/">putting a lot of the blame on Congress</a>, and this is yet another part of it. This is Congress's job. no one should let them off the hook with the excuse that they "have to" do what the NSA or the president says.<----->Conservatives

Doug Bailey<-----><a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/blogs/hotlineoncall/2013/06/i-hotline-i-founder-doug-bailey-passes-away-10?mrefid=mostViewed">Doug Bailey, the founder of The Hotline, RIP.</a><br /><br />The Hotline was simply the best way to follow campaign news in 1988. And 1990. And 1992. And every election through at least 2000, which means at least through the point at which National Journal acquired it in 1996. I've had Hotline access on and off over the years, depending on where I worked, and it's been consistently excellent throughout. Not only extremely informative, but always a lot of fun. In fact, just last week I realized <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/newsletters">you could get "Wake-Up Call"</a> via email, and subscribed.<br /><br />Before the Hotline...well, you just couldn't get a lot of information. Polling aggregation, news stories about Senate and House races as well as presidential nominations, the important and the trivial; I don't know whether Bailey invented aggregation on that level, but it was definitely a big step forward for political information, and it was done right. <br /><br />By all accounts, Bailey was also a good guy, and a solid campaign consultant before he left that business. I do know that there are Hotline alums all over the place, and the ones I know of are generally excellent. I assume he deserves a good deal of the credit for that, too, either directly or by establishing the right kind of workplace. <br /><br />The Hotline was a terrific achievement, one that made politics better for a long time. He'll be missed.<----->General
The Changing National Self-Image<----->Not sure if I'm going to get to any regular news posting today and tomorrow, but I've been touristing around Washington all weekend and can at least share a few thoughts on that.<br /><br />Mainly, on the changes to the Mall. I hadn't previously been able to see the WWII and Korea Memorials; I also hadn't seen the King Memorial, although I had seen FDR already.<br /><br />I had a fairly mixed view of the WWII memorial...I really don't have much of a problem with heroic, triumphant national self-celebration. Was it specific enough to the conflict? I'm not sure, and I'm not sure that the size was sustained by the content -- it's very large, that is, and yet it's not entirely clear why.<br /><br />I do find the placement of it, along with the Korea and Vietnam memorials, striking in how it almost completely upends the old feel of the Mall.<br /><br />When I first visited Washington, none of those were there. The Mall was defined by Washington and Lincoln and, although he's off to the side and only visible from a small area, by Jefferson; what's more, it's defined by Congress, on the other end from Lincoln, and then the White House, also only visible from a small area.<br /><br />While the Smithsonian museums (fewer then) do take up a large amount of space, the addition of the war memorials does two things. On the one hand, it makes the national self-image seem far more obsessed with all things military. I really don't like that at all. But there's a second part to it: all three of those war memorials are focused mainly (and with Vietnam exclusively) on the ordinary people involved, not on generals and presidents. That's a real contrast with the old Mall of Abe, George, Tom, the White House, and Congress. Add to that a heroic memorial to an advocate for social justice and a very populist memorial to FDR.<br /><br />So: the theory is that since the 1970s the US self-image as seen in the National Mall is both more militaristic and more democratic.<----->General
Sunday Question for Everyone-21<----->Sorry, on the run, so I'm going to do just one question today and I suspect it's one that I've asked before. But it's newly relevant now, and so: during the 2016 election, are civil liberties/surveillance issues important in the nomination battles? In one party, the other, or both? Are they important in the general election?<br /><br />By "important" I'm just talking about what the candidates talk about and what the press talks about. No matter what, these types of issues are extremely unlikely to move votes, but there's more to elections than what moves votes.<----->General
What Mattered This Week?-22<----->I'm not sure how the NSA revelations mattered, but odds are they did. Alec McGillis has <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/113413/nsa-spying-scandal-could-cleanse-america-post-911-mindset#">one argument</a> on it all; sounds plausible to me.<br /><br />For what doesn't matter...there's a bit of a spin war about how ACA will work out. The substance of that matters a lot; the spin, almost none.<br /><br />So that's what I have. What am I missing? What do you think mattered this week?<----->General

Old, Old, Senate Update<----->Two special elections to replace two older Senators, with the late Senator Lautenberg an especially significant case (he was 89).<br /><br />I think I've written about Massachusetts before, but it's looking very much like a wasted opportunity. Ed Markey, the solid favorite, will turn 67 in July. That's not young!<br /><br />The Republican in the race, Gabriel Gomez, is only 47 (he'll be 48 in August). So there's some hope of a relatively young new Senator. But I'll be pretty surprised if he wins.<br /><br />In New Jersey, the only Republican in the race so far is Steve Lonegan, 57. It's looking as of right this minute that he's reasonably likely to win the nomination, but not be a very strong general election candidate at all in the October special, so the real question appears to be on the Democratic side. Three candidates there: Cory Booker, 44; Frank Pallone, 61; and Rush Holt, 64. C'mon, New Jersey!<br /><br />By the way, it doesn't matter much in the long run, but for whatever it's worth the new placeholder Senator from New Jersey, is...48. Or maybe 47. He was born in 1965, says his newly-updated wikipedia page, and we have him as a 1987 Notre Dame grad, but so far no date of birth.<----->Liberals
PEPFAR and the Presidency<----->I have a <a href="http://prospect.org/article/once-upon-time-there-was-president">new column</a> up over at TAP about the presidency, about how the presidency we have isn't particularly Constitution-based. It goes along with last week's column there, which was about why the myth of the magical heroic-king presidency is so persistent; this one is about how our ideas about the presidency gain strength because the Constitutional version is such an empty shell.<br /><br />I used an example at the end about how George W. Bush's program to fight HIV/AIDS in Africa, PEPFAR, was in part a reaction to the "need" for him to have something feel-good to say in his 2003 SOTU speech. As it happens, I also use that initiative as an example of something else about the presidency, so I'll use this excuse to tell that one, too.<br /><br />What I find in explaining the Neustadtian presidency is that the hard part for people to grasp is the part about how the bargaining presidency needs to do "persuade" people and groups to do things across the board. Everyone understands that Congress doesn't have to do what presidents want (even if they often forget it; see, again, that magical hero-king), but the rest of it seems less intuitive to many people. Sometimes that's because there's a basic assumption that, say, the executive branch has to do what presidents say...that's one of the reasons I find Watergate so interesting, since it's chock full of examples of executive branch agencies and departments ignoring what Nixon wanted.<br /><br />Then there's the president's political party, and party-aligned interest groups. Here, I think the assumption is again too often that they will do whatever the president says; presidents are the "leaders" of the party. But that's wrong; parties, and party-aligned groups, are autonomous, and there's little inherent hierarchical structure. It's often in the interest of the party to go along with the president, but any president who thinks he can just issue edicts and have the party fall in line will be very disappointed -- as George W. Bush was when he tried to put a buddy on the Supreme Court.<br /><br />Anyway, to PEPFAR: I really like this example, but I do have one problem, which is that I'm not entirely sure it's true. I always include that disclaimer when I use it....at one point, I wasted a few hours trying to track it down in sort of a half-assed way, and failed, and concluded that I might as well just keep using it as long as I always remember to mention that I'm not sure whether it's correct or not.<br /><br />The point of the story is that presidents are always asking people for things that those people are free to refuse. In this case, the president was George W. Bush, the people were Christian conservatives, and what Bush was asking for was for them to look the other way. Why? Bush, for various sensible presidential reasons (oh, and perhaps also because it was a Good Thing, I suppose) wanted to do something about the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa. The problem? Doing something about the epidemic was going to mean US money paying for condoms, and a lot of Christian conservatives really don't like condoms. If they opposed the initiative, then the Republican Congress probably wasn't going to pass it, at least not in a form in which it could actually work.<br /><br />Bush didn't need Christian conservative groups to support the program. He just needed them to look the other way. Which they didn't have to do!<br /><br />Again, whether that's fictional or not, it's not unusual. Think, for example, about same-sex couples (and the groups who lobby on their behalf) and <a href="http://prospect.org/article/immigration-gay-community-should-take-one-team">the current immigration bill</a>.<br /><br />The point is that Bush couldn't order Christian conservatives to look the other way. He had to "persuade" them. Usually, that's going to take the form of bargaining of some sort, either in particular deals, or more generally keeping a group "on board" enough that it will go along.<br /><br />Presidents, as Neustadt says, have more things to bargain with than anyone else in the political system; they also, however, have more things to ask for, and more people to ask, than anyone else.<br /><br />At any rate, the Prospect column isn't very newsy, but it does get at one of the core issues with the presidency, I hope. It's just a very difficult office to nail down, and it has been from the start.<----->Obama

Immigration? Maybe<----->I have a post up over at Greg's place <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/06/05/do-republicans-want-immigration-reform/">about Marco Rubio's (perhaps) flip</a> on immigration, and at PP about the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/06/05/of-course-there-wont-be-a-bipartisan-house-immigration-bill/">breakdown of the House bipartisan talks</a>. I'm sticking with what I've always said: the big question here is whether mainstream House conservatives want a bill or not. If they do, John Boehner will bring up the Senate bill and let it pass; if not, he won't. End of story.<br /><br />Matt Yglesias has <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/06/05/rubio_and_immigration_reform.html">the same logic</a>, but thinks that surely House Republicans will want it to fail, as have a few people I've seen on twitter. I've written a bunch of things that all concluded that it was all up to House mainstream conservatives, but haven't engaged at all on what their incentives are. So I'll give it a shot here.<br /><br />Here's Yglesias:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">From the GOP perspective, the calculus of a path to citizenship has two elements. On the one hand, most of these new citizens would probably be Democrats. On the other hand, taking part in a bipartisan immigration reform effort might open Latino voters' ears to other aspects of the GOP message. But the absolute worst-case scenario is one in which <i>a path to citzenship becomes law over the loud objections of GOP-elected officials.&nbsp;</i></blockquote>So he concludes it's "unlikely" that the House would do it.<br /><br />He might be right! But there's another point of view which also might win out. Republicans might decide that there's a collective action problem here in which the party as a whole (and especially their future presidential candidates) are better off if immigration passes, but most Members of the House (and many Senators) are better off if they vote against it.<br /><br />And what Yglesias considers the worst-case might not be. Remember, the bill that's going to move, if one does, is the bipartisan Senate bill -- a bill which guarantees that at least three Republicans (the Gang of Eight minus Rubio) will get a fair amount of the credit and will earn a trip to a White House signing ceremony. So opposition to the bill might not be seen as a partisan split even if the majority of Republicans vote against it, and at any rate it might be better for GOP-Latino relations to have the issue disappear after a bill passes than for the issue to stick around to 2016 and beyond.<br /><br />What it might come down to, really, is that bit about "loud objections of GOP-elected officials." If Congressional opponents of the bill can manage to avoid arguments perceived as bigoted -- if they can restrict themselves to praise for immigrants and immigration reform but just not quite <i>this</i> bill -- then the whole thing could at least plausibly work for both individual Members and the GOP as a whole. But if the debate is bound to descend into immigrant-bashing, then it doesn't.<br /><br />The only other thing I could add here is that all of this is about perceptions, not reality. The question isn't what will actually be good for the GOP as a whole; it's what individual Members of the House believe will be good.<br /><br />I have no idea what House conservatives are actually thinking. I just can't see either side being clear and obvious. And my guess is we won't start to know the answers until after the Senate acts.<----->Obama

June 4, 1973<----->The Senate Watergate hearings resumed after a long recess. There are plenty of important witnesses, but it's clear both inside the White House and outside that John Dean, scheduled soon, will be the star witness -- and will implicate the president in the cover-up.<br /><br />So today Richard Nixon starts a more serious preparation: for the next week, he listens to hours and hours of the White House tapes. More people are learning of the tapes; in the new White House, it's not restricted to just the chief of staff, but in addition to Al Haig, Ron Zeigler now learns of the tapes, as does WH counsel Len Garment and Fred Buzhardt, who is basically Nixon's on-staff defense attorney.<br /><br />For the Watergate Committee, the big issue today is a <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F7071EF738551A7493C7A9178DD85F478785F9">request from Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox</a> that the committee put everything on hold for up to three months so that Cox can move on the prosecutions, and Sam Ervin's decision to refuse that request. It's an interesting question. Which is more important: the prosecution of any criminal activity, or exposing the truth as soon as possible? Of course, there's an institutional struggle, too; rarely is Neustadt's observation that the Constitution established a system of separated institutions sharing powers more obviously true.<br /><br />At any rate: Ervin would win this round, and the next set of hearings would continue.<----->Liberals
Even More on Ted Cruz, Elbows, Senators, and Parties<-----><div class="tr_bq">The story so far:</div><br />John Sides said that Ted Cruz was hurting his chances at the nomination by alienating Republican Senators. Dave Hopkins said: maybe not. I then did a <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/06/01/ted_cruzs_personality_problem/">Salon column</a> over the weekend more or less taking Dave's side. <br /><br />John <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/2013/06/02/further-thoughts-on-ted-cruzs-sharp-elbows/">responded</a>:<br /><blockquote>But any nominee needs broader support in the partysupport beyond his natural base. &nbsp;In fact, Cohen and colleagues show that it is support from party leaders <i>outside</i> a candidates base that is truly potent: it appears to drive fundraising, media coverage, and ultimately poll numbers.[...] &nbsp;My point is that the kinds of behavior that would earn him the endorsements from Senators who are not his conservative kindred are likely to earn him the support of other party leaders who arent in the Senate and are outside his natural base. &nbsp;(And, by the way, thats a base he cant even count on if Paul runs.) &nbsp;And the support of these other leaders is what would be most valuable. &nbsp;Thats why I think Cruzs M.O. isnt optimal. &nbsp;Hes antagonizing some of the same people that would be most useful to have in his corner.</blockquote>And Dave took the bait and responded in detail in the comments. He argues that personal relationships are perhaps less important than other factors in winning endorsements. And he also argues, as I did in the Salon piece, that the kinds of "go along to get along" behavior that winds friends within Congress has rarely helped much on the campaign trail.<br /><br />John then responded to Dave (we're still in comments over at the Monkey Cage), saying "Id suggest that Cruz, by engendering resentment among at least some of his colleagues (and others like them outside of the Senate), may have a harder time convincing enough Republicans" to support him.<br /><br />I'd say the parenthetical is doing a lot of work there -- the "others like them outside of the Senate" bit.<br /><br />What I think, I suppose, is that outsiders -- that is, party actors outside of Congress, and especially outside of Washington -- probably heavily discount either positive or negative reputation for "plays well with others" that's based primarily on intra-Senate testimony. They will look for cues about ideology, sure. But the rest...I'm just not sure that outsiders consider Members of Congress a reliable source of information. Or at least: Washingtonians tend to overrate the extent to which intra-Senate reputation for collegiality will wind up mattering.<br /><br />In other words, what matters here is whether party actors outside of Congress think of themselves as "others like them" or not; that is, whether they think of themselves and the Senators upset by Cruz as part of the same set of non-crazy Republicans, or if they instead them of those Senators as "Congress" and themselves as "not-Congress." And I think there's some evidence, over the years, that it's the latter.<br /><br />On the other hand...there's a lot more of the national Democratic and Republican national parties than there was in 1960, or even in 1980. That might matter, and it might tend to make John's point relatively stronger -- depending, that is, on whether the rest of the national party things of Congress as a body apart or not.<br /><br />What's really at question here is about the various different components of our expanded parties, and how they fit together. Clearly Republican Senators are a part of the larger Republican national party network, and each Senator is part of his or her state's party network, but exactly how important they are to the presidential nomination process, either directly or through their effect on reputation, is a lot trickier to figure out.<br /><br />And I agree with John that we're talking tendencies here, not absolutes. Indeed, on balance I agree with him (and I suspect that Dave does to, although of course I can't speak for him) that "Cruzs behavior, if it continues, is doing more to decrease his chance of winning the GOP nomination than to increase it." I just think it's probably a minor factor, and one that may be in part balanced out by the upside of using the aggressive strategy. But, yes, I think that if Cruz could build his reputation as a demagogue without actually annoying his fellow Senators, that would likely be a bit better for his presidential prospects.<----->Conservatives
Seeking Washington Tourism Expertise<----->A bit off the usual path: we're finally doing a family trip to Washington this weekend, and I'm looking for tourism suggestions. Specifically, any new stuff I don't know about. I haven't done a touristy trip to Washington since Hector was a pup...well, really, not since my wife and I lived there. I have been over to the (mediocre at best, in my view) FDR Memorial, but otherwise I really haven't done anything touristy in a long, long time.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>So, helpful people: what should I know that I don't know? What's new that wasn't there twenty years ago that should be on a can't-miss list, or even an if-you-have-time list? What's changed about visiting the things that were there that I probably don't know about? The (high-school and college aged) kids are excellent tourists with broad interests, so really anything good is worth knowing about. Any help, or any pointers to further help, would be very much appreciated.</div><div><br /></div><div>Thank you!</div><----->General
Assumption GOP Will Blockade DC Circuit Is Probably Wrong<----->With the three DC Circuit Court of Appeals nominees finally getting named and sent to the Senate today, I'm seeing a lot of liberal pessimism about the next step. Kevin Drum <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/06/wee-question-about-republicans-and-dc-circuit-court">says</a> "We already know that Republicans are going to oppose all three of Obama's nominees...because, based on its caseload, the DC Court is too big and should be pared back by three seats." Matt Yglesias is <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/06/04/dc_circuit_fight.html">even more convinced</a>: "Note that precisely because the stakes are high here the odds of Obama succeeding are approximately zero." I know when I write about the possibility of a GOP blockade in these seats, I regularly get comments hitting me for suggesting that such a blockade is only possible, not virtually certain.<br /><br />I guess we'll see soon enough, but I think this is wrong. For one thing, if Republicans really do choose to explicitly blockade the DC Circuit, it would almost certainly push Democrats over the edge into going nuclear. For another, the Republican record just hasn't been one of blockading Appeals Court nominees. Yes, lots of foot-dragging, and yes, 60 votes are required for all of them, and yes, most draw some opposition...and, yes, a few have been defeated. But that's all. The majority of Barack Obama's appellate nominees have eventually been confirmed -- and that's true whether Republicans had 40 or 41 or 47 or 45 seats in the Senate.<br /><br />Here's my guess -- not a prediction, but just a guess based on past patterns. We'll continue to hear the insipid rhetoric about "court packing" and how the DC Circuit doesn't need any judges anyway, but that will be mostly just background music for the rubes. One of the picks will get through fairly easily. One will be killed by filibuster. And the third will be a close call, but probably get through, perhaps with a few Republicans voting yes on cloture but against confirmation. Those opposing picks will mainly focus on claims that the nominees are out of the mainstream ideologically, or will allege lack of proper judicial temperament, or some other such reason -- very few Republicans will claim that they are blockading the DC Circuit Court.<br /><br />It's a guess, not a prediction. But I do think it's more likely all three will be confirmed than that all three will be defeated. Far more likely.<br /><br />And what's more...if the Judiciary Committee, Harry Reid, and Barack Obama are aggressive about the schedule, including a replacement if one of the current nominees is defeated by filibuster, then all three seats will be filled during the current Congress.<----->Conservatives

Wilkins, a federal district court judge in the District of Columbia, is among those being considered by President Obama to fill one of three vacancies on a key federal court, nominations he could announce <i>as early as this week</i>, according to legal experts.&nbsp;</blockquote>(My emphasis.)<br /><br />So last Monday we had three apparent finalists and an announcement any minute...and this week, we have four finalists for three spots, with an announcement still any minute.<br /><br />I might as well toss in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-pushing-to-diversify-federal-judiciary-amid-gop-delays/2013/03/03/16f7d206-7aab-11e2-9a75-dab0201670da_story.html">this WaPo gem from March 3</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The president has named three dozen judicial candidates since January and is expected to nominate scores more over the next few months, aides said.</blockquote>In which gullible reporters gave Obama credit for renominating judges who the Senate hadn't confirmed last year.<br /><br />Hey, maybe it really will happen this time! But, you know, as Woody said: fool me once, Dr. Crane.* I'm not from Missouri, but at this point if Obama wants me to believe that these nominations are happening, he'll have to show me.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Okay: I use that one all the time, but I don't remember which episode it's from. Anyone?<br /><br /><br />[UPDATE: And now, the latest is that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/06/03/obama-expected-to-name-three-nominees-to-d-c-circuit-tuesday/">the judges will in fact be named tomorrow</a>. After an emergency meeting of the Plain Blog board of directors, we've decided to go with "my pressure got them to do it" rather than "perhaps I was just whining a lot over nothing." Although I probably should just wait until it really happens to believe it, anyway...]<----->Obama
Remember: In Democracies, Policy is Contested<----->I wrote: "The chief job of party leaders in the Senate is to look out for individual senators interests and protect their rights." Which led to a letter-to-the-editor denouncing me, or Senator, or someone; my sentence "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-trouble-with-congress--in-one-sentence/2013/06/02/8f1aaeec-ca1b-11e2-9cd9-3b9a22a4000a_story.html">perfectly captured whats wrong with Congress</a>."<div><blockquote class="tr_bq">The chief job of leaders in the Senate is to do the peoples business. &nbsp;The minute people in an organization begin protecting their interests and rights instead of doing what the organization is supposed to do is the minute the organization becomes dysfunctional. Unfortunately, that describes most of the government today.</blockquote><div>I pick on this mainly because I suspect this sentiment is extremely widespread. It is, however, wrong.</div><div><br /></div><div>To the letter-writer, I would say: go back to Madison, and read <a href="http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa51.htm">Federalist 51</a>. For Madison, the self-interest of politicians was a given. What's needed, he says, is a way to harness that self-interest for democratic purposes.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Which is exactly what's happening here. Party leaders in the Senate look out for individual Senators' interests -- which means that they make it possible for Senators to work for their own states' interests.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>More broadly, the entire US political system (and, I think, every representative democracy) is based in very large part on the career ambitions of politicians, and thus on electoral incentives. What's unusual about the US system is that great efforts are made to restrain the maximum influence of any one politician or even set of politicians (federalism, separated institutions sharing powers); and, at the same time, individually empowered politicians are given very different constituencies, thus giving them incentives to see particular, localized interests as well as or even more than the "national" interest.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Indeed, one of the big changes over the last fifty years or so has been the rise of the national political parties, which has balanced out to some extent the constitutionally-mandated bias towards localism and particularism. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing is certainly a question for reasonable disagreement, but that it's happened is, in my view at least, clear historic fact.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>If one believes that "the people's business" is self-evident, and that the majority will agree, then it's natural to conclude that something must be wrong with democracy when those self-evident policies are not being followed. The problem with exhorting politicians to just "do the people's business" is that what constitutes "the people's business" is <i>contested. </i>&nbsp;And what to do when large groups disagree about what is self-evident, or at least what is best, is the whole point of democratic design -- and a difficult problem indeed to solve.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Which is not to say that the Framer's solution, as adapted and modified over the years, is the only solution, or even necessarily the best one. But one doesn't get far in designing a democracy without understanding that basic problem.</div><div><br /></div><----->General
