   step...
   http://horror-writers.net/stories/the-shadow-of-death-by-alan-dale-dalb
   y/

   Nov 2, 2012
   It's the first week of November and I have taken my vacation to get the
   next novel going. I hope all of you are writing too. This is the month
   for it. Any time is a good time to slap your imagination down on the
   page. I look forward to seeing what you all come up with. Never stop.
   If you love it, if it is your passion and your true calling, or just a
   fun hobby to pass the time...never stop creating. You've got great
   stories bubbling in your brain and we think you should share them!
   Cheers everyone!

   I am revisiting and fixing all of my stories for submissions.

   If you have been turned down a lot over the years, go back and give
   those rejected gems another look.

   You've grown and learned and honed your craft.

   You will polish and perfect your seeds of genius and help them flower
   until soon their sweet aroma will open up the nostrils of those who had
   no interest in you before.

   Never give in, never stop working on the same old stuff that you know
   has potential.

   Cut out anything that needn't be there and present the most streamlined
   version of your story that you can.

   With time they have forgotten those submissions they rejected and you
   have the chance to make a second first impression.

   You WILL get there if you keep working, keep writing, keep growing,
   keep up those long sleepless nights of edit after edit until you
   finally have exactly what they are looking for.

   You're already an author. You've already won. All you need to do is
   make it happen.

   Your stories won't fix themselves nor will they run off and find their
   audience on their own.

   These are your children and they are very welcome to stay at home as
   long as they want, but wouldn't you much rather boot them out into the
   world and see them succeed?

   Be a proud parent. Be an author. Be a dreamer and bring your dreams to
   life.

   It's in you. Unleash your power and you can do anything.
