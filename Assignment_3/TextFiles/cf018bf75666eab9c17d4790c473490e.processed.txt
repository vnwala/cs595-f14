[23]Be Bold in the Molding

   by [24]BeautyForAshes61

[71]Pretty Hurts

   by [72]BeautyForAshes61

   Eating disorders continue to surge as women are spoon-fed a variety of
   lies from the media; today blonde hair, big boobs and a thigh gap are
   in, tomorrow it’s the witty, curvaceous brunette. All of these false
   ideals put us on a hamster wheel that progresses in its level of
   destructiveness. It hurts to be pretty, it hurts to believe that
   because you’re not a certain size you aren’t pretty. God didn’t call
   His girls to be pretty though, He called them to be fierce and
   beautiful.
