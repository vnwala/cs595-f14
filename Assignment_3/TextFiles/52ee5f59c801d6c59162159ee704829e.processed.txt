   ----------------------  
   Life Story and BIO:   Isabelle was born in Indianapolis, Indiana to
   Jared and Victoria. Her father, Jared Lawrence was the head sheriff at
   the local metro police station while her mother was a simple housewife.
   She was the second oldest of the Lawrence clan;
   Michael was older by two years while Kristen was younger by six years.
   Ever since Isabelle received the news of her mother being pregnant with
   Kristen, she knew she would be protective over her baby sister. With a
   headstrong and courageous attitude, she wouldn’t let anything come in
   her way of hurting her little sister. After Isabelle was nearly
   kidnapped by a random stranger on her way to her friend’s house, Jared
   hastily rushed to teach her self-defense. Along with her self-defense
   lessons, he reluctantly thought it was a wise decision to teach her how
   to use a gun properly and a knife. It was always in his mind to teach
   his daughters how to defend themselves from an attacker. Little did he
   know that his beliefs would save Isabelle in upcoming end of the world.
   Being the brightest in her classes, Isabelle achieved a 4.5 GPA, giving
   her the opportunity to go to college and major in film. She had always
   been somewhat of an anti-social gal all of her life. It didn’t thrill
   her to go out and party or go dancing at the clubs. She would rather
   stay indoors and watch films with both her father and brother.
   Sometimes her father would take her to the shooting ranges to advance
   her abilities with a gun. Even though it made Isabelle filled with the
   utmost joy, her mother disapproved of her actions. Victoria thoroughly
   despised her father’s actions of taking their daughter to the ranges.
   It was in her mindset for her to go to college and receive a well
   paying job. Isabelle was more of a tomboy than a “girlie girl” which
   was what her mother wanted her to be.
   Isabelle’s choices in life clashed with her parents’ marriage. Jared
   and Victoria would consistently fight about Isabelle’s future. She was
   thrilled when she went off to college to get away from her mother.
   After obtaining her Master’s degree in writing and film, she moved in
   with her close friend to an apartment. Steadily, she found work and
   made a life for herself. But soon, everything she worked hard to obtain
   came crashing down.
   She was in her apartment complex, watching Star Wars when she heard the
   excruciatingly loud shrieks of one of her neighbors. Removing her
   Batman blanket off of her conditioned body, she approached the door and
   opened it, peering her head out. Down the corridor, she saw two people
   both on the floor. Hesitantly, she spoke out in worry as she took some
   steps forward.
   As she reached them, she looked over the person’s shoulder and saw that
   it was her neighbor from across the hall, digging into one of the other
   tenants of their floor. Placing her hand over her mouth to stop herself
   from gagging, she quickly ran back towards her room to call for the
   police. As she was running, she tripped over her own two feet, causing
   a loud thud to resonate throughout the halls; her neighbor slowly
   turned his head then limpidly stood up and made its way towards her.
   Isabelle couldn’t help but scream at the sight of blood and flesh
   gushing down the person from 401’s face. He reached towards her leg but
   thanks to Isabelle’s fast reflexes, she kicked his hand away and
   crawled into her apartment, shutting the door injudiciously. Pants and
   the sound of Isabelle rushing to find her gun filled the room as she
   moved with haste. She wielded it in both hands shakily and opened the
   door only to see her neighbor from 401 right outside. Quickly, she
   pulled the trigger which ending up between his blue eyes.
   “What… what is going on?!” Now panting heavily, she moved into her
   apartment and fixed up a bag of some necessary items before she made
   her way outside. She felt horrible for killing her neighbor but… there
   was something wrong with him. She knew she had to go talk to her dad
   about the unfortunate event.
   While running, she heard a TV speaking the words, “the end is nigh!
   It’s the zombie apocalypse!” Laughter and a smile came forth; Belle
   couldn’t really take it seriously. A zombie apocalypse? That couldn’t
   be possible… could it? Hours later the answer would come to her.
   Using her cardio, she ran down the stairs of her apartment building and
   towards her car, quickly getting inside. Belle drove as fast as she
   could to her parents’ house, entering it to see her parents holding the
   worst facial expressions she had ever seen from them; fear was painted
   all over. Belle went to her father and told him about her neighbor. He
   took Belle in a hug and pulled her close to his warm body.
   “It’s okay, pumpkin. The TV said there have been reports of strange
   behavior coming from people. You were only protecting yourself.”
   Suddenly, their father-daughter moment was interrupted when the front
   door busted open. A rotten body of their neighbor started to attack
   their mother. Her shrieks rang throughout the house as he clawed at her
   body and bit her neck. Jared took Belle’s pistol from her bag and shot
   at the attacker. Michael, Kristen, and Belle all had tears in their
   eyes; they just witnessed their mother being viciously murdered by
   someone they knew.   
   Jared told Belle to go and call an ambulance and get some supplies like
   his pistols and hunting knifes. She quickly looked around the house and
   grabbed the best objects she could and placed them in a bag. She rushed
   and picked up the phone, only to find the lines were dead. Rushing
   back, she heard a deep voice scream; her brother’s. She sprinted back
   into the room and saw her mother literally eating Michael. Nothing but
   a high-pitched scream came out of her mouth, causing her mother to be
   attracted to it. Her mother got up, groaned, and went after Belle. Out
   of pure reflex, Belle raised her pistol and shot her mother in the
   head, right between the eyes.
   Jared backed away towards a nearby wall, taking in what just even
   happened. As he reached towards the wall, another invader pushed
   through the window and bit Jared’s biceps, causing him to roar in pain
   and collapse to the ground. The walker took a bite then size of an
   apple out of her father’s arm. Belle raised the pistol and shot the
   intruding zombie.
   She was losing her family quickly. Kristen and Belle all were left in
   the Lawrence family. Her father whispered for them to come over towards
   him. Belle took his hand while tears obstructed her line of vision. He
   told her to take Kristen and protect her at all costs, to not let her
   fall victim to the outbreak. She promised him. Whispering with his last
   breaths, he said he didn’t want to turn like his wife.   Belle and
   Kristen both gave their last kisses goodbye to their father before she
   stood up and aimed the pistol at her father’s temple.
     “I love you dad…I’ll see you soon.” She cried softly as she pulled
   the trigger; the impact of the bullet hitting her father’s body caused
   it to jolt. She moved towards her brother’s body and aimed the pistol,
   knowing he’d come back just like their mother had. The signs were all
   there. She shot her Michael while covering her sister’s eyes; she had
   seen enough already.
   Belle closed her father’s eyes, grabbed her bag, took Kristen’s hand
   and left their once loving, childhood home.
     ----------------------  
   Three weeks had gone by since the incident. Eventually the two sisters
   made their way to Georgia, hoping some family down there would still be
   okay. Belle tried her hardest to keep her promise to her father but
   failed. One day, she accidentally set off a fire alarm while they were
   getting supplies. Walkers swarmed around her sister and herself.
   Swiftly, they were outmatched as what seemed like over twenty walkers
   appeared.
   Isabelle tightly grabbed her sweet sister’s hand and made a run for it
   towards the nearby fire escape. Both climbed onto the roof of the
   building to try and escape. Kristen and Belle ran fast... but not fast
   enough.
   A walker caught their hands on Kristen and started to attack her.
   Numerous walkers limped up and surrounded Kristen, eventually leading
   to her demise. Belle screamed, shooting as many walkers as she could
   but ran out of bullets and ammo. She ran for it, leaving Kristen to be
   tortured and eaten up by the walkers. Belle jumped and made it on
   another roof, making it so the walkers couldn’t reach her due to their
   decayed legs. Belle screeched out as she watched the walkers eat away
   at her sister.
   She failed her father's last wish.  
   ----------------------  
   A couple of days passed since the incident. Isabelle eventually ended
   up with a survivor group led by Rick Grimes, despite her wishes. She
   felt as if she was a death magnet.   In the survivor group, she always
   did things alone; it wasn’t because she didn't trust anyone, rather she
   didn't want to see anyone getting hurt.
