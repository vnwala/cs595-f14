   "How dare you have an opinion on tumblr, you dumbass bitch. I hope you
   get raped."

   Wow.
   Could you not find something more original to say to me?

[41]I am in no way looking for sympathy with this post:

   [42]toxic-killjoys:

     [43]sempiternal-punkworld:

     I would just like to say my own opinion on this whole Sam Pepper /
     VeeOneEye situation. I am in no way agreeing that either one of them
     was correct with their choices in the matter. But what bothers me
     the most, is that you had to make a video sort of calling them out.
     Yes, I understand that…

     You’re saying it’s wrong that she called him out on getting her
     drunk and having sex with her?? Really?? She’s underage and being
     drunk fucks with your decision-making (which includes saying yes or
     no to sex) and he should’ve been responsible enough to realize that.
     I’m pretty fucking sure his amount of fans doesn’t matter to her.
     Don’t defend his bad actions.

   She could’ve said no to drinking. He didn’t force her to. And, I didn’t
   defend him. I said my thoughts on the situation. I can’t hate someone
   who saved my life bud ✌

[50]Hello again! :3 Excuse The List xx

   There was many questions on my Tumblr in which I have refused to
   answer. Due to the fact that:
   1. I am not a whore for not hating VeeOneEye.
   2. I am not an idiot.
   3. My grammatical issues are due to a mental cause I’m which I can not
   fix. (Dyslexia)
   4. Why am I getting comments about, Alex I think his name is? I do not
   know who the guy was or his situation.
   5. Calling me ugly in this matter does not mean anything?? Sure I know
   I’m ugly but god damn you call me that because I do not agree with you?

   I am sorry for no more questions. I can not answer these questions, for
   I have deleted them.

   Stay Amazing; Stay Rad

   Anonymous asked: People were raped, you can't excuse that.

   Being a person who has been raped I would like to explain something
   about that….
   I read some of the other girls responses, of their “VeeOneEye
   experiences” most of them being that they were his age.
   One that I read was she was at a party and she had been drinking, and
   Jason was there too drinking. They were both drinking and we’re
   drinking by their own hand, meaning they chose to.
   They slept with each other that night and Jason was gone in the
   morning.
   It was a one night stand MOST guys don’t stick around or talk after
   that!
   I’m still not saying that rape is okay. In fact it’s fucking
   disgusting! But sadly it is a part of our world in which we all hate. I
   can in no way stop it. I feel terrible for people who were raped. I
   really do, and I wish them the best luck of getting over the slump you
   fall into after it happens….

   {I in no way agree with sexual harrasment. These are my beliefs choose
   on your own which way you would like to think of them.}
