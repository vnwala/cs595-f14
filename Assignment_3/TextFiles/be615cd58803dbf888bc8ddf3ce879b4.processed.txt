1. Create a Processing Profile

   Complete a short application so that we can match you with companies
   currently looking for processors that fit your profile. This is an
   equal opportunity offer and no one will be discriminated against
   because of age, race, sex, education, employment history and you will
   not be asked for references. No one will be refused the opportunity of
   processing offers for our company.

2. Pick Your Job(s)

   Compare and choose which of our partner companies you would like to
   process trial offers for. There is NO limit on how many companies you
   can start working for because we have such a huge demand for
   processors. You will have multiple companies interested in hiring you
   today. In short...we need Trial Offer Processors immediately to fulfill
   our ongoing demand.

3. Complete Assignments

   You can work at your own pace and choose the days and hours you wish to
   work. If you can follow simple step-by-step instructions and type out
   some basic information, then you can be a Trail Offer Processor. You
   will be paid between $12.33 to $27.90 per hour depending on the company
   and offers you process. Many of our processors are making up to 371.25+
   a week part-time.
