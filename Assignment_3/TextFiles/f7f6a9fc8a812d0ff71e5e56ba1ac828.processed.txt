   Posted in [12]Friday Roundup, [13]Misc. by [14]alifewellconsumed

   Hi everyone!

   [15]postcard
   Curtis and I are currently in sunny, hot Palm Springs this week. Loving
   the heat and excuses to linger in the pool all day. We are planning on
   doing a day trip to [16]La Jolla and staying overnight at
   [17]The Saguaro Hotel to take advantage of their pool, bar and other
   amenities. If you follow me on [18]Twitter or Instagram, you can see
   photos from the trip.

[94]Weekend Recap

   Posted in [95]Misc., [96]Weekend Recap by [97]alifewellconsumed

   Happy Monday!

   Our weekend was an uneventful one. Started out with dining out a
   Mexican joint [98]Topanga Cafe on Friday night. It was delicious!
   Apparently it has been around since the 70s, which is amazing in
   itself.
   [99]Blended margaritas

   Later we watched [101]The Great Beauty an Italian film by Paulo
   Sorrentino. It was an excellent film and we highly recommend it. The
   rundown of it is an older gentleman, a former novelist, has just had
   his 65th birthday. He has been part of the social scene of Rome for
   decades and now is reflecting on his past and future. The dialogue
   between the characters and the scenery of Rome is what makes the film.
   [102]MCDGRBE EC017
   Saturday consisted of errands and taking the VW out for a drive. This
   was Piper’s highlight of his day.
   [103]Saturday's dinner

   Saturday’s dinner

   We picked up ribs on the way home and had a rib charcuterie board. Ribs
   were spicy and fell off the bone. Afterwards we enjoyed watching the
   sci-fi flick [104]Under the Skin with ScarJo.
   [105]film-under-the-skin-1
   Sunday I slept in and read in bed for a bit while sipping some tea. I
   really enjoy those mornings from time to time. With having a mind that
   is always racing with thoughts and ideas, I take advantage of
   those. Curtis was at work and I had the house to myself to do as I
   pleased. When he got home, we went out and ran an errand for my aunt
   then enjoyed a late lunch at [106]Paul’s Omelettery with my sister.
   Paul’s is always a good idea, the food is decent, the prices reflect
   that and the staff are great!
   [107]inside Paul's

   Inside Paul’s

   We took the VW out for might be the last time this year and stopped at
   the beach. It’s always sad to say goodbye to summer here in Vancouver.
   Yes we have it easier than up north and east of the Rockies, but I feel
   it is too short of a season. Another reason why I would like to move to
   Southern California.

   As I’m typing this, I’m enjoying watching the F1 race from this morning
   in Singapore. This season was one of the more interesting ones the last
   few years. The rivalry between Hamilton and Rosberg is exciting and I
   am personally glad Vettel’s lack of skills are showing. Unfortunately
   this race, not much of one between Hamilton and Rosberg since Rosberg
   retired early due to mechanical issues.

   As I said, it was a pretty uneventful couple of days, but sometimes
   those are the best.

[130]Friday Roundup

   Posted in [131]Friday Roundup by [132]alifewellconsumed

   Hi everyone,

   In less than a week I will be in sunny, hot Palm Springs. My weekend
   will consist of running some errands, enjoying the sun that is
   forecasted for Vancouver and celebrating a friend’s birthday. I’m
   really excited that my summer will be extended by the visit to Palm
   Springs where it will be in the 40s. This also means my suitcase will
   be light with mostly summer clothes in it. might be heavier returning
   though! After my return home, I shall post a few Palm Springs Guides
   for eating, shopping, drinks, activities and accommodations.

   Some photos from this week, you can also find them on my Instagram.

[171]What’s Cookin’

   Posted in [172]Recipes, [173]What's Cookin' by [174]alifewellconsumed

   Hi all,

   I appreciate recipes that are easy and flavourful that end up in your
   regular rotation for weeknight dinners. Out of my extensive cookbook
   collection, there is one person with many cookbooks that I turn to on a
   weekly basis for those recipes.

   That author is [175]Donna Hay from Australia.
   [176]image-claremontquartercomau
   She is a food stylist, author and magazine editor. I love [177]Donna
   Hay, from her great cookbooks, her magazine to her TV show. My love
   started for her with looking through my mom’s copies of her books. Now
   all of her cookbooks are in my collection, the photography is amazing
   and just that is reason to buy the books. I haven’t come across a
   recipe I haven’t enjoyed, from her [178]Fresh and Light, [179]Seasons,
   Modern Classics [180]Vol. 1 & [181]Vol. 2 and [182]Fast, Fresh and
   Simple books. Each issue of her magazine is inspiring, all staying
   seasonal. The photos trigger a saliva build up in my mouth, while I’m
   fantasizing about cooking each recipe. If you don’t own one of her
   books, I highly suggest doing so in the near future! You won’t regret
   it.

   One of my favourites is the Lemon-Feta Chicken from her [183]No Time to
   Cook book.

   [184]9780732288167

   Lemon-feta Chicken
   serves 2

   2 x 8oz chicken breast fillets, trimmed
   1 cup of feta, thickly sliced
   5 sprigs oregano
   1 tablespoon lemon zest
   2 tablespoons lemon juice
   olive oil, for sprinkling
   cracked black pepper
   green salad, optional

   Preheat the oven to 180C (355F). Place chicken, feta, oregano, lemon
   zest and juice in a baking dish. Sprinkle with olive oil and pepper.
   Bake for 18 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through. Serve with a
   simple green salad, if desired.

   Enjoy! xo

[235]Design Wednesday

   Posted in [236]Design Wednesday by [237]alifewellconsumed

   Let’s talk about stationery this week. I love receiving business cards,
   especially when they are unique and memorable.

   Stunning and memorable business cards being letterpress to die-cut
   could help beat off the competition. Business cards are the most
   essential tool of any professional in the world. Once you pass it to
   your potential client, there’s no receiving it back so when you take
   that one chance, make sure to leave a terrific impression and not see
   your business card tossed into the nearest trash.

   Below are various examples of what can be accomplished.

   Letterpress
   Letterpress printing has been around for hundreds of years. In this
   printing method, a surface with raised letters is inked and pressed to
   the surface of the printing substrate to reproduce an image in reverse.
