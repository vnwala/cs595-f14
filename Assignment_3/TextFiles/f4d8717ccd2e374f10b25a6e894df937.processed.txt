                           Just for Kids Preschool

   At Just For KIDS Preschool, we provide a variety of programs whose
   primary goal is to encourage exploration of the world while developing
   skills and a love of learning.  All of our programs are designed to
   emphasize the development of building each child as an individual.  The
   child’s social and emotional growth will be stimulated through daily
   interaction with peers, the use of a variety of learning and play
   materials, dramatic play, songs and finger plays.

   Physical growth is developed within our [9]physical education program
   where the emphasis is on hand/eye and foot/eye coordination, balance,
   creative movement and fundamental locomotion skills.  We strive to
   build on the child’s strengths and provide them with the opportunity to
   experience success through appropriate goal setting.

   The child’s intellectual growth and creativity will be strengthened
   through our carefully planned classroom activities.  The children will
   be given an opportunity to explore and discover the world around them,
   while experimenting with new materials, games, toys and books.  Our
   weekly themes will provide variety, imagination and skill development
   as well as supplement the individual attention given to each child.

   Our programs include:

   * Academic ½ and extended day programs for 2-5 year olds

   * Enrichment classes for children 3-6 years including math, reading,
   science, Spanish, art, music, and cooking

   * Lunch Bunch

   * Kids’ Saturday Night at the Movies

   * Birthday Parties

   * Holiday Stop, Drop, and Shop

   * Gingerbread House Workshop
