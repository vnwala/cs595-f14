[10]DEFCON 22: The Con That Keeps on Giving

   Load up this soundtrack while reading this blog
   post: [11]http://somafm.com/defcon/ I'll wait.

                   Alice in Hackerland by Tess Schrodiner
                        Winning artwork for DEFCON 22

Redefining The Experience

   I began my seventh [13]DEFCON looking for a way to give back.
   There's only one other con I hold in as high esteem, and that's my
   hometown science fiction convention, [14]RadCon (this year was my
   [15]18th RadCon). Over the years, I've been to dozens of other cons,
   some regularly (like [16]PAX Prime and [17]Norwescon), but if I miss
   them, no big deal. DEFCON is a pillar of my year, drilled 100ft into
   the earth and rising up to the clouds, and it would take one hell of a
   real-life tragedy to keep me from it.
   And like RadCon, I can no longer just attend. I've been a panelist at
   RadCon for the last two years, and I'm driven to figure out how to
   participate in DEFCON. Not only because of how much I've gotten from
   it, and how much I continue to get from it, but for the selfish fact
   that there are diminishing returns in terms of what I can learn as a
   non-participant audience.
   The few talks I attended were unremarkable. Since I no longer work in
   IT, I avoid highly technical talks, which are no longer useful to my
   career. I know enough security theory to write fiction; readers don't
   want to hear the tech details anyway. If a story is set in a
   far-future, 2014 tech won't matter, and if I need something current,
   like safe-cracking for Through a Shattered Tumbler, I can look it up
   online.
   As a curious person, I often enjoy hearing about new exploits, but even
   those have started to blend together. The message is always the same:
   All things are pwned or pwnable. This is a very worthy message, but for
   me, it's ancient news. It's not as likely to give me a dopamine
   "ah-ha!" or "holy shit!" feeling anymore. After "holy shit did you know
   you can [18]stop someone's pacemaker?" and "holy shit all of
   [19]Boston's transit is owned!" and "holy shit the Russian cybermob,
   [20]the nets are all gonna DIE!" ... You can only get excited about the
   sky falling for so long before even that becomes normal. The sky is
   falling, and it's already fallen, and Situation Normal All Fucked Up
   (SNAFU).

                      [21][Bun6PHvIcAAPztS.jpg:large]
                    This screenshot circulated on Twitter
         of a hacking tool itself being the vector for mass pwnage.
                     Amusing, but totally unsurprising.

   I don't mean to make DEFCON sound unexciting. I had an amazing time
   this year, as always. But as a neophile, I crave new experiences.
   Moreover, I'm writing for neophiles who also crave new experiences, and
   you don't want to read a recap that's a recap of [22]last year's recap.
   So this isn't a regular post describing the talks or hallway
   shenanigans.
   Mostly, this year was about seeking my place, teaching others, and
   enjoying the synthesis that comes from mingling knowledge. i.e. making
   friends and having conversations. This is the true value of any con,
   because we can learn the rest online. We can watch all the talks on
   YouTube. What we can't do is talk and wave our hands about and toast to
   a point that everyone agrees on.
   This year, mingling came easy thanks to my [23]autism diagnosis and
   anxiety medication. This was my second DEFCON since my DX. Last year,
   my SSRI prescription was brand new and I was still adjusting. I noticed
   the improvement then, and all the more this year. The power of
   technology has made social anxiety a distant memory, and I have better
   coping mechanisms and a higher sense self-acceptance since I know that
   there is a medical basis for my quirks.
   However, the meds don't fix everything. The distracting and painful
   sensation of anxiety is quelled, but it doesn't fix my awkwardness, the
   times I'm not sure what to do or what is appropriate. I'm still
   combatting 38 years of overcompensating, learned behaviors I used to
   avoid anxiety. The extra serotonin doesn't cure my autism or sensory
   processing disorders. Sometimes the background noise is too loud and I
   can't tell what people are saying. Sometimes I'm not sure how to engage
   in conversation with people I want to talk to, or leave conversations
   with people I'm no longer interested in.
   Sometimes I lock up and don't know what to say, so I stay silent when I
   should be talking. Or the opposite, a more recent coping mechanism
   where open my mouth anyway, and let words pour out without any filters.
   Which works until it doesn't, and I say the wrong thing.
   The meds really help in all these cases, because when I do make
   mistakes or face uncertainty, I'm not assaulted with waves of anxiety
   that pull me under onto the hamster wheel of self-assault. I'm much
   more resilient and can keep rolling.

                         [24][20140808_130226.jpg]
                              Why Spot the Fed
                     when you can bring the Feds to you?

   This has all improved my experience at DEFCON a hundredfold. It's a
   much more social event than it has been in years past.

I'm-Poser Syndrome*

   * - Attempted pun
   When I arrived at the Rio on Wednesday, I felt pretty wobbly and low,
   and I wondered what right I had to be at DEFCON at all. I'd submitted a
   talk to CFP, which summarized my several years of research on unethical
   persuasion and group mind control (which all culminated in my book
   [25]Recovering Agency: Lifting the Veil of Mormon Mind Control). The
   talk got rejected, partly because it was non-computery and partly
   because the religious criticism it contained was potentially too
   controversial. I would be attending as a non-participant once again.
   And in absence of a tech career, with less hands-on computing in my
   hobby life, with my interests shifting more to psychology,
   neuroscience, and writing, I really wondered why I belonged at DEFCON
   at all. [26]Impostor Syndrome had set in pretty hard.

[35]Reflected in Ice: An Aspergers Review of Frozen

   The following movie review contains mild spoilers. I try to tread
   lightly, but can't avoid addressing a few in-movie moments or thematic
   elements.
   [36][snow_queen_elsa_in_frozen-wide.jpg]
   There are two measures of good art.
   The first is anything that can make me feel strongly. The other is that
   which holds up a mirror to the viewers, in which, each sees herself.
   Frozen accomplished both of these goals with resounding success.

                        [37][reflection_fairy2.gif]
                         Secret Wish - Tami Vaughn
             I had this printed on a mousepad I used for years.

   Good mirrors are composed of metaphors and character traits and plot in
   the right combination of vague and specific to reflect a broad range of
   life situations and personalities. Many types of people see themselves
   in Frozen: girls who are raised to be perfect, sisters who struggle in
   their relationships, women who are deceived by those they trust, those
   who have secrets, neurodiverse people, anyone who is misunderstood, and
   anyone who is rejected for all the wrong reasons. And like the second
   trial in [38]The NeverEnding Story, a mirror which reveals the viewers
   "true self", Frozen's mirror can reflect the ugly parts of some people,
   like the blogger, "Well-Behaved Mormon Woman", who [39]calls Frozen
   part of the "gay agenda to normalize homosexuality" and who says it's
   terrible we're letting kids get the message that rebellion is better
   than obedience.

                      [40][1334552515835_9226445.png]
                        Can you hold it down, please?
                    I'm trying to make history over here.

   Whatever, lady. I have an entirely different view when I look at myself
   in art.

[49]RadCon 6B Report

   What an amazing [50]RadCon was at its best this year. It's not just me
   saying that, but [51]all the [52]blog posts and [53]Facebook reviews
   say the same. I was left yesterday being completely exhausted, that
   type of bone-weary you feel in every cell, like when you're sick, only
   without any symptoms. Today, after resting up, I'm bursting with
   post-con energy.
   I was a panelist again this year, but this time it wasn't a last-minute
   thing, so I had participated in the programming process from the
   beginning. Liz was trying to keep everyone with a maximum of five
   panels to avoid wearing us out, but I'm greedy. I like sitting around a
   table talking about things I know and am passionate about. So I asked
   her for more. I ended up with eight, including my reading. On top of
   that, [54]NIWA scheduled me for five hours running the table in the
   small press room. Even though this meant I had zero time to see the
   rest of the con, I don't regret it for a second.

   This is the first Radcon where I never stepped one foot inside the
   dealers room or the gaming room. There simply wasn't time.
   Friday began at 2pm with a last-minute panel because someone else had
   canceled. It was Professionalism in Indie Publishing, in which I met or
   re-met some great fellow indie authors and publishers, [58]Kaye
   Thornbrugh, [59]Mike Chinakos (former president of NIWA), and [60]David
   Boop. We talked about the importance of presenting a professionally
   written and formatted book, acting professionally, and the differences
   between individual self-publishing and independent publishers.
   At 4:30, I moderated my first panel ever, Picture This! This is an
   unusual panel, and my second time doing it. It's a really fun exercise.
   Three authors (myself, [61]Peter "Frog" Jones, and [62]S. Evan
   Townsend), read some fiction, while pro authors and audience members
   (if they want), draw a sketch inspired by the reading. The Pro artists
   included [63]Howard Tayler, [64]Herb Leonhard, and [65]John Gray. It's
   a really great way for artists and writers to mingle. Our two creative
   crafts can play off one another so well. I've been inspired by art, and
   as they proved in the panel, it works in the other direction.
   I read a draft of my as-yet unpublished story, "Meltdown in Freezer
   Three", which included vivid images of ice cream trucks and praying
   mantises. Here are the three different interpretations of my story:

   Here is my schedule:
   Friday:
   2pm – Indie Professionalism in Self-Publishing
   2205
   Do you have what it takes to be a successful indie? Selling your book
   to hundreds of readers requires more skill than selling it to a single
   editor (not less). Discussing professional behavior in networking, PR,
   and dealing with rejection.
   With: Willich, Dameon      Thornbrugh, Kaye      Chinakos, Mike
   Boop, David
   4pm – Picture This!
   Fan Suite
   Everyone has a mental movie that plays as we read. Our writers bring

   8pm – Polyamory Revival
   2205
   Polyamory is returning to mainstream consciousness with hit shows like
   “Polyamory: Married and Dating” on Showtime and feature stories in
   major news outlets. There are several misconceptions about polyamory,
   the first being that it is a “new” type of relationship model.  Learn
   how polyamory is from times of old, how agriculture and property
   ownership changed family dynamics, and how certain polyamory models are
   especially empowering for women. Enjoy the discussion, and walk away
   with suggested readings to further your knowledge on this fascinating
   subject.
   With: Jones, Peter     Goldstein, Ari     Baldwin, Amanda  Thomas,
   Johnathan   Lindsey, Roland
   9:15 – 50 Shades of Consent
   2205
   With the success of books like 50 Shades of Grey, more people than ever
   are reading about BDSM. But when writing about it, what are some
   misunderstandings or common errors to avoid? How can writers present it
   in ways that are safe, sane, and consensual?
   With: Jones, Peter     Thomas, Johnathan     Baldwin, Amanda  Lindsey,
   Roland
   Saturday:

   12:30pm – Writing Neurodiversity
   2203
   Creating neurodiverse characters with autism, Aspergers, ADHD, bipolar,

[86]Label Me, Illuminate Me

   The label-debate rages on, and now that I know I have autism, I have
   firmly come down on one side: I am in favor of labels.
   Labels can be used to dehumanize, to misconstrue, to overgeneralize,
   and to blind us to a person's humanity and individuality. As Wayne
   said, "If you label me, you negate me".

               [87][Screen+Shot+2014-01-23+at+2.36.18+PM.png]
                            [88]Preach it, Wayne.
                               Then party on.

   Actually, it was the philosopher [89]Søren Kierkegaard who originally
   said this. [90]"Butterflygirl" on Yahoo Answers summarized Kierkegaard
   thusly:

     Once you label someone you cancel out their own individuality and
     replace it within the boundaries of that label, so their
     individually has been restricted within that label and therefore,
     for all those who accept that label for that person they have no
     longer accepted that person for who they really are but understand
     them only to the limit of that label.

   And I know all too well from my research into [91]mind control that
   [92]loaded language combined with us vs. them techniques can indeed
   leverage labels to negate an individual and render her selfless. It can
   be used to dismiss external points of view. Labels can make a group
   insider feel benevolent and normal while demonizing outsiders as
   inhuman and evil.
   Many people fairly point out that labels, particularly psychological
   labels, can divide people. Labels can become truth. We are all
   individuals, but dumping thousands or millions of people into the same
   bucket removes some sense of self. Being labeled in school can make
   kids a target of bullying, not just from other kids but from teachers
   as well. It can impose expectations in education and in the workplace
   and among peers. Labeling can trigger tribalism and hostility. When
   people are unfairly labeled, they end up filling the role others expect
   of them.
   I've met people in person and read blog posts from people who hate all
   labels. Here's a dude summing up this line of thought:
   [EMBED]
   These are certainly valid drawbacks, but like The Spork of Truth, it
   has four tines. Hm, no I need something else... Like the Spoon of
   Truth, it has two edges. The same aspects that make labels problematic
   also give labels power. And when your label has power, you have power.

[101]Persuade the Bystanders

   This post has to do with social justice – you know, topics like
   privilege, racism, sexism, classism, ablism, and all the other ignorant
   and/or hatey "isms" worth railing against. I'll get to those in a
   second.
   In the late 90s, while arguing politics on BBS message boards, I
   realized an important truth that I've carried with me always:
   When people argue in public, they will almost never convince one
   another. But they do influence the lurkers.

                              [102][o9SgB.png]
                          [103]WWIV message boards
                         My view of the world when I
                     learned this important life lesson

   Sometimes the persuasion is instant. Now and then a lurker will timidly
   post and reveal that their minds have been changed. But most keep this
   fact to themselves. More often, the change is slow. These lurkers
   continue to follow similar arguments, until eventually, they are swayed
   by whichever side has collectively made the best case. I myself have
   drastically changed my mind on deeply held beliefs in this way, both by
   debating and merely watching debates. I've also seen it happen to other
   people. But it's rarely instant.
   It's hard to know that these neutral and persuadable lurkers exist.
   They are, by their nature, quiet. Very often, though not always, the
   more vocal a person is, the less likely they are to be convinced. So we
   tend to think everyone who doesn't use a megaphone is just like
   everyone who does. This is not true.
   I think about the topic of persuasion alot. I'm a writer. It's my job
   to persuade. I also love debate, a casual pastime since childhood.
   Roland makes a wonderful and challenging debate partner to help me
   better understand what works and what doesn't. On top of all that, I've
   studied mind control, otherwise known as "coercive persuasion" – the
   ability of manipulators to convince people against their will.

[112]2013 Accomplishments - 2014 Goals

   What a year. In reviewing my [113]goals from last year, looks like I
   got way off track, but I'm very pleased with what I accomplished.
   This year, I:
     * Was a panelist at [114]Radcon.
     * Went to [115]Rainforest Writer's Retreat and met lots of amazing
       people.
     * Sold [116]a story to a pro-paying market, [117]Crossed Genres. It
       will also come out in a [118]print anthology this year.
     * Gave one reading (at Radcon).
     * Released [119]Emerald City Dreamer in print.
     * I got diagnosed with [120]Asperger's Syndrome. And started becoming
       an expert on autism.
     * And now for something completely different, I wrote a 150,000 word
       nonfiction book, Releasing Agency: Lifting the Veil of Mormon Mind
       Control.

   One reason I didn't accomplish all of my 2013 goals is because of that
   little sidetrack. It's a book I had thought about writing based on my
   [121]mind control website in 2005, forgotten about, and then on a whim
   decided to crank it out "real quick". The effort took 7 months (with
   distractions in between). It is currently out to alpha readers.
   Emerald City Iron made it through the writer's group, and is ready for
   the next round of edits, when I can get to it.
   I have a bunch of stories to submit, and one in particular is totally
   publishable. It's been rejected twice, both with a personal note from
   the editor, so I know it will sell. I just have to get it, and the
   others, out there. I set the bar pretty high for myself. I currently
   only submit stories to pro-paying markets until those venues are
   exhausted, and then I might send it to semi-pro markets. My time and
   [122]splines are fairly limited, so I'd rather spend time aiming at
   high targets, being a perfectionist, and working on totally unplanned
   projects. ;)
   So my goals for this year:
     * Publish Recovering Agency in print and ebook.
     * Market Recovering Agency, including launching a new website and
       giving interviews.
     * Be a panelist at Radcon again.
     * Be invited as a visiting pro at another con for 2015. Norwescon
       would be nice.
     * Speak at [123]Defcon.
     * Speak elsewhere, either a seminar, or [124]Exmormon Foundation, or
       some convention related to cults or religion, on the topic of mind
       control.
     * Write a whole bunch of blog posts on autism and mind control.
     * Release Emerald City Iron.
     * Complete a major step in a novel: Either write the first draft of
       the next Dreams by Streetlight book or the second draft of The Sun
       Never Rises.
     * Sell two stories to pro-paying markets. I'd really love to sell to
       an anthology.

   If that seems like alot, it's because it is. So we'll see. :) There's a
   significant chance I will be caught up in marketing Recovering
   Agency for many months. It's already generated plenty of interest. I
   need to be okay with dropping many of the above goals in trade for
   promoting a book that could really help people. And maybe pay some
   bills in the process.
   So here's to 2014. May it be a very good year for all of us.

[132]Autism and Shame

   At the end of the week when I literally wrote the chapter on shame (in
   my book Recovering Agency: Lifting the Veil of Mormon Mind Control), I
   found myself curled up on my bed, sobbing, in the throes of a meltdown,
   feeling like the worst person on earth -- feeling vitally broken in all
   the ways that count -- feeling like the unresolvable source of pain for
   everyone around me.
   And I was helpless to watch from somewhere within, knowing I
   was suffering from shame, but unable to think my way out of its cage.
   What is shame?
   The concepts of guilt and shame are frequently confused with one
   another. They both seem triggered by the same stimuli. Yet they are two
   distinct feelings with quite different implications and outcomes.
   I've seen two definitions of the differences that ring true to me.
   The first is that shame is related to your social position, while guilt
   is a personal feeling. That is, shame requires your sense of relation
   to others -- you have done something and others are exerting pressure
   on you to stop. OR, if they don't know what you've done, you are afraid
   they will find out because if they did, they would exert pressure on
   you. Whereas guilt is the knowledge that you've done something wrong,
   and you feel remorse and a desire to correct the behavior regardless of
   whether anyone else knows about it.
   The second difference is perhaps the most enlightening. Guilt is about
   what you have done; shame is about who you are. Guilt is, "I have done
   something bad". Shame is "I am bad".
   Brené Brown gave two powerful TED talks on the concept of vulnerability
   that both focus heavily on the concept of shame. I cannot overstate
   this concept enough, so I will repeat it in her words: "Shame is a
   focus on self; guilt is a focus on behavior. Shame is I am bad, guilt
   is I did something bad."

[141]Splines Theory: A Spoons Metaphor for Autism

   An incident occurred last week where my child unexpectedly needed a
   ride to school in the middle of my writing session. And it ruined my
   whole day. Why?
   I knew it had to do with [142]Aspergers, but I wanted to know more.
   Puzzling over this question, I went in search for the perfect metaphor
   to describe the experience.
   I love the spoons metaphor for invisible disabilities. It describes a
   portion of my world, and it goes something like this: Every morning,
   most typical people wake up with infinite spoons. They don't even think
   of spoons as a resource because they almost never run out. They can
   easily choose to do this or that without risking much other than time
   consumption. Sure, they get tired by the end of a full day, but
   generally they have enough spoons to do all the normal things. It's a
   gift they take for granted.
   Those with chronic pain or serious illness or certain types of mental
   illness, like [143]depression, only get twelve or twenty spoons a day.
   Each activity, even small things like getting dressed or making
   breakfast, takes a spoon. Careful choices must be made about how the
   spoons are spent; otherwise, they will be gone before the day is
   through. Or worse. A bad spoon-management choice might leave them
   without spoons for several days.

                       [144][There_is_no_Spoon.jpg]
                   There is no spoon. It's just a theory.
                     Which states aren't enough spoons.
     The word "spoon" is actually quite weird, when you think about it.
                          Why is it called a spoon?
                            Oh, [145]that's why.
                              It's still weird.
                  I'm already out of spoons. I wonder why?
                           Oh look, a butterfly!

   For the origin of Spoon Theory, and why spoons and not some other
   eating utinsil, see Christine Miserandino's account on her blog,
   [146]But You Don't Look Sick.
   I relate to this analogy somewhat, but it fails to describe the
   intricate resource-management I must do as an aspie. I wake up with a
   random number of spoons. Why? Why do I mysteriously get a bunch of new
   spoons at unpredictable times? The process of getting ready for a new
   task seems to cost me "spoons", but that model doesn't reflect the
   intricacies of the gathering process itself. What about the frustration
   I feel when I fail to gather or get interrupted? How do I describe the
   sense that a dozen little things need doing before I can start a big
   thing, each costing a fractional "spoon"?
   Spoon Theory didn't fit the all data for my experience, so I went in
   search of a Grand Unified Theory of Resources or Law of Conservation of
   Aspergers Energy that I could use to think about and describe my
   universe.

[155]The Year I Survived Suicide

   [Trigger Warning: Uncensored exploration of self-harm, suicide, and
   extreme exposure to the vulnerable side of Luna's brain. May contain
   trace amounts of navel-gazing.]
   This year, I survived suicide. At least three times. The incidents have
   started to blur together,  so let's go with three. It's a nice round
   number.
   I've only recently stabilized enough to process what that means. Last
   week a friend attempted, and the strong emotions that bubbled up showed
   just how much I needed to process my own recent encounters with death.
   I'm not here to tell her story. It's not mine to tell. But I've decided
   to finally tell my own.
   [156][image_gallery.jpeg]
   There are far more reasons to not talk about it. Those of us who suffer
   from suicidal thoughts also suffer shame for thinking them. The
   illnesses that lead to anguish and despair are themselves shameful,
   without the added "sin" and "crime" of killing oneself. I didn't want
   to talk about it then, not on Twitter, not to friends or family, not to
   therapists, and not even to crisis lines. I didn't want to be drama. I
   didn't want anyone to think I was manipulating them. When I felt
   better, I lied and told myself I was fine. When I felt terrible, I
   wanted everyone to think I was fine. I'm strong, independent, smart,
   rational. All the time. I wanted to pretend my weak times weren't
   really me.
   Even well after the fact, I've hesitated and procrastinated writing
   this post. I've debated the merits and drawbacks. And then, along came
   [157]Suicide Prevention Week. [158]The Bloggess wrote a timely post on
   it, so I figured...
   It's time. I am throwing aside my shame. I will use my aspy powers of
   unorthodox bluntness, and unwise social decisions, and a general
   blindness for knowing what's appropriate, and a pinch of impulsivity to
   tell everyone exactly how close I came to killing myself this year.
   Because the stigma needs to end. Because those in pain need to feel
   okay reaching out. And those who suffer need to realize they're not the
   only ones who suffer. Anyone who finds themselves grasping the sheets
   in despair on those long, dark nights need to know that successful,
   talented, beautiful people also have dark nights, or weeks, or years
   when we hate ourselves. If someone like me can hate myself*, then
   maybe, just maybe, those other beautiful, talented, worthwhile souls
   will realize they, too, have something to be admired for. Something to
   contribute. Just one more little excuse to hang on a little longer.
   Because on those dark nights, every little excuse is a lifeline.
   * Yes, I just called myself successful, talented, and beautiful. I'm
   also impulsive, blunt, socially unwise, and yeah we already covered
   that.

[167]Mind Control 101: Cogs of Dissonance

   Your brain is full of machines. Each machine is made of thousands of
   cogs spinning in tandem with one another, and all the machines are more
   or less connected and dependent upon each other. When a cog starts to
   break down, other parts of the machine pitch in to repair it, replace
   it, or bypass it. This is because your survival is dependent upon the
   smooth functioning of each and every cog.
   Or so the machines want you to think. Because they control you.

                         [168][brain-gears-md.png]
                         This is your brain on cogs.
                               Any questions?

   This is, of course, an analogy which I'm using to illustrate a
   complicated idea -- the theory of cognitive dissonance. A cognition (or
   cog) is any single thought, feeling, idea, concept, perception,
   behavior, social feedback, memory, attitude, goal, value, or
   commitment. When you put them together with other cognitions, they
   build all the belief systems that make up you. Earth is round, tacos
   are delicious, love feels nice, kittens are fuzzy, corporations are
   evil, God is great, and Republicans all suck and should go hide in a
   cave until they come up with some way to not look like a bunch of
   clowns.
   Or whatever it is you believe. I happen to have a moderate opinion on
   the flavor of tacos, and I've never met God so I'm not sure how neat He
   is.
   Each of these cogs, and the belief systems they build, have varying
   levels of importance. There are people who would die to save their
   favorite taco, and other people who don't really care that much about
   food. How strongly you feel when your precious (or not-so-precious) cog
   is threatened will inform your reaction to various kinds of incoming
   cogs that other people throw at you. By the way... you might want to
   duck.
   You see, living in the world means we constantly encounter new
   cognitions every day. [169]The Flat Earth Society distributes
   pamphlets, [170]paleovangelists push their anti-taco propaganda, love
   breaks your heart, kittens are proven to cause cancer, corporations run
   ads about saving lives, atheists say [171]God is not great, and you've
   got friends who are Republican. Everyone has a different message to
   push, and if we really believed everything we heard, we'd change our
   minds everyday about everything. More frighteningly, we'd never know
   what brand of breakfast cereal to buy. (I'm a paleovangelist, so I
   don't buy cereal brands. None of them are true.) Our brains need some
   sort of mechanism to hold all our cogs together or they'd roll bouncing
   our of our heads and people would trip on them and fall down.
   That mechanism is an emotional reward and punishment system known as
   Cognitive Consonance and Dissonance. Consonance is a good feeling. When
   we see a beautiful taco on TV, spinning in a glorious light, with
   beautiful green lettuce hand-picked for its photogenic properties,
   sticking out from the crunchy shell at aesthetically pleasing angles,
   and the announcer shouts, "Recommended by four out of five dentists who
   chew gum for people who like mouthwatering, savory tacos!", we think
   "Yes! I knew it! I knew I loved tacos. And now they're healthy, too!
   Sweet Jesus I was right all along! Baptize me in Fire™ sauce!"

[180]DEFCON 21: L33tism Yields to Unrestricted Access

                        [181][DEFCON+Chills+Out.jpeg]
                             Projector Art in the
                          Chillout Cafe at DEFCON 21

   The hacker community is many things. We are curious, smart,
   knowledgable, subversive, rebellious, libertarian-leaning, technical,
   opinionated, unorthodox, and l33t.
   But most of all l33t. Historically, we felt special, like our merits
   had won us the right to gloat in glory. We dabbled in technoarts and
   arcane secrets of circuits and mystical crypto that put us above
   everyone else. We were the best of the best, we pwned every test,
   earned the right to beat our chest.
   Well, I didn't. Only "real" hackers did, and I wasn't a real hacker. In
   the [182]DEFCON recap [183]I wrote in 2009, I called myself a "Hacker
   Groupie". That was bullshit. Because I am every inch a hacker, and
   always have been, since second grade when I solved the weekly
   brainteaser without fail. When I begged my parents for a chemistry set.
   When I used university lasers to run the [184]Michelson-Morely
   experiment. I'm less technical these days than I ever have been, with
   my shift away from a thirteen-year IT career in 2010, yet I am still a
   hacker.

                     [185][DEFCON21+Playing+Card.jpg]
                                Hax0rz Wild!
                    From the DEFCON 21 Playing Card Deck

   L33tist hacker culture is changing, and it's about damn time. L33tism
   comes with problems. L33t = elite = elitism, and the price for that is
   exclusion of alot of really smart people who belong, but are too humble
   or shy to think of themselves as hackers. For too many wasted years, I
   was one of those people on the outside looking in, wishing to be part
   of an exclusive club that I actually had every right to belong to. It
   took meeting someone who never asks for permission and didn't think I
   should either. Roland taught me that to belong, I had to shove my way
   into the circle and simply be who I am. I had to have the rights
   granted to me by a boyfriend before I could enter.
   No, this is not going to be a rant against sexism, though I will
   address that topic at some point. My exclusion wasn't due to my gender,
   though that was a factor. I self-excluded because I bought into the
   chest-thumping and was unwilling to call bullshit and be who I wanted
   to be. Too many men and women have done the same. I met several of them
   at DEFCON this year, and I tried to talk them into realizing their
   potential.
   In 2009, at my second DEFCON, I somehow considered myself an outsider,
   a groupie, a tagalong. This year was my sixth DEFCON. Why did it take
   so many years to finally stop feeling like a poser? Like any topic
   worth talking about, it is complex and there are many reasons, but I
   want to focus on culture here, since I've been around to observe it
   since 1992.

[194]Touch of Tides - Crossed Genres

   I am exceptionally excited to announce that my story, [195]Touch of
   Tides, was just published in [196]Crossed Genres magazine. Please check
   it out, and while you're there, read the other two stories by
   [197]DeAnna Knippling and [198]Michael Ben Silva III.
   In Touch of Tides, a xenobiologist explores the oceans of Europa. Mara
   has synesthesia, meaning her senses are crossed -- what she feels on
   her skin she also sees with her eyes. Her passion is studying Europan
   life, hands-on. Until she finds something dangerous.
   Here are the opening paragraphs:

   I swim with no light, artificial or natural. A solid ice shell, seven
   kilometers thick, floats above me in this single ocean that covers the
   entire moon of Europa. All I can hear is liquid gurgling in my ears and
   I taste residual salt that leaks in around my gill breather.

   My name is Mara. I am naked except for my equipment belt and a
   molecule-thin coating of nanoscale to protect me from the chill. The
   other biologists at my barnacle wear full wetsuits when they dive,
   relying on augmented reality. My gill could report water conditions,
   geolocation data, and radar sight, if I let it distract me.

   I prefer to let the touch-colors lead...

     - [199]See more at Crossed Genres.

   Crossed Genres also gave me [200]the spotlight interview, in which I
   answer questions about Touch of Tides, [201]synesthesia, [202]autism,
   and more.
   I am particularly proud of this one, because it is my first hard
   science fiction story. I spent a lot of time researching, asking
   experts, sketching, and even doing math, to make sure the details of
   the story were realistic. Science is very central to the plot, and all
   of this could actually happen. (Meaning all my other stories are
   completely impossible, I guess.) It also marks my first pro-rate sale.
   I wrote it for you. Please enjoy reading it.

[210]Mind Control 101: The Basics

                 Remember this? Youre still doing it wrong.
                             Keep trying, buddy.

   We have explored what thought reform is not in [211]Mind Control 101:
   Myths of Brainwashing. But what is it? What force can shut down
   people's minds and get them to do things they otherwise would never
   consent to?
   Cult Conversion Walkthrough (Storytime!)
   No one is immune from mind control. And contrariwise, mind control
   doesn't always work. It takes the right combination of factors;
   specifically trust, common ideals, and receptivity.
   Cults are a good place to study mind control because the changes they
   effect on people's lives are extremely obvious.
   Pretend for a moment you are having a difficult time in your life: a
   recent tragedy or major transition. Maybe you've just gone through
   divorce, lost a loved one, you've moved to a new town, or have recently
   been fired. You're feeling alone, scared, depressed, ashamed, or
   desperate.
   One day you encounter someone who is nice to you. Either it's a friend
   or associate, or even a complete stranger. Maybe it is someone handing
   out pamphlets, or speaking to a crowd. Who ever it is, he has kind
   eyes, and you feel a little better when you're around him. He also
   seems to share your values. Maybe he wants to help the poor, or he
   talks about the power of love, or God, or protecting animals. Imagine
   your greatest value, and he also shares that value with a level of
   passion you admire.
   He invites you to a meeting or a party. Once there, you find a room
   full of people who say nice things to you, lifting your spirits. They
   are involved in a cause you wholeheartedly endorse. They take care of
   the sick or collect food for the poor, or educate kids about
   capitalism, or share the message of God to the world.
   Being around these people makes you feel good. You feel as if you
   belong. You quickly forget your personal problems and begin spending
   more time with this group, working towards making the world a better
   place.
   They have won your trust.
   Now you are fairly receptive to what the leader may tell you. He will
   use this time to win more of your trust and make you more receptive. If
   you've had niggling doubts about your new friends or their beliefs,
   they are easily explained away.
   Slowly, you are introduced to new ideas you may not have accepted at
   first. Over time, more is required of you. More money, more time, more
   sacrifices. Your behavior is slowly restricted. Maybe you are required
   to dress a special way, eat or not eat certain foods, show up at a
   certain number of meetings, be so busy you don't get proper sleep or
   nutrition.
   Now the grip tightens. The leader teaches you doctrines to instill
   phobias about the outside world. You learn that your group has many
   enemies to fear. Those enemies are not to be listened to because you
   will be unable to resist when they try to lead you away from the love
   of the group. You are given thought-terminating cliches, phrases or
   words that help you easily dismiss criticism. You are elite, one of the
   chosen to help save the world from political error, or one of the
   blessed of God. Your very language is altered, as your words become
   "loaded". This prevents you from properly thinking about certain
   concepts, and from properly communicating with people outside the
   group. You have become dependent upon the group for your emotional
   well-being, and you are possibly even physically or financially
   dependent. You are isolated, if not physically, then mentally, because
   there are many sources of information you are taught to distrust.
   When you think about the group and its teachings, you are filled with a
   sense of euphoria. Thinking about outsiders or criticisms makes you
   feel anger or confusion. The thought of leaving the group or "switching
   sides" makes you feel guilty, ashamed, or afraid. If something is not
   going as promised, you blame yourself, not the group. There are no gray
   areas left in your world view -- things are either good or evil, left
   or right, pure or tainted, full of life or death.
   You now automatically reject any criticism, no matter how valid it is.
   You reject any fact that goes contrary to your beliefs, because your
   beliefs have become more important than reality. Certain words are now
   triggers that cause you to reject specific ideas before you even have a
   chance to hear them out.
   You feel yourself to be perfectly rational, far more enlightened or
   intelligent than those with opposing views. Yet instead, your brain has
   been crippled from the mind viruses you voluntarily made part of you.
   What Just Happened?
   Here is the process:

[220]Iceland Fire: A Week With No Night: Part Two

   Please read [221]Part 1 of my Icelandic adventure.
   Before I left, I raved about how excited I was to attend [222]Elf
   School.

                         [223][20130614_144621.jpg]
                           Álfaskólinn, 2nd floor.

   The school was located in a mixed-zone industrial/commercial park, but
   it also seemed like an apartment. The place was piled high with books
   and troll figures and gnome statues. A small reception desk remained
   unmanned, and I called out until his wife appeared, and then summoned
   Magnús from the maze. He looked to be out of a fairy lore himself, a
   giant of a man, tall and round, with a white beard and a bright red
   shirt.
   With regrets and several hugs, he informed me that since I was the only
   attendee, he would not be holding elf school that day. If I could wait
   until Tuesday when a big group was scheduled to come through? But no, I
   would be back in the states by Tuesday.
   To be honest, I had mixed feelings about missing elf school. I was in a
   fair amount of pain due to a minor operation I had just undergone at
   the hospital (more on that later), so was a bit nervous about trying to
   make it through four hours of lessons without passing out. He gave me
   the text book for free, and promised to send an electronic copy of the
   new edition when it comes out. So I got another rare folklore book to
   add to my collection, which made me happy enough. Half of it is in
   German, the other half in English, and I get the sense that the German
   stories are not the same as the English ones.
   I've got a couple of random pictures I'd like to go through. First,
   viking hats. They were everywhere.

Bio

   I am an indie author in Seattle, WA. I have been writing fiction and
   nonfiction since age four, and at some point, became an accidental
   expert on mind control, computers, autism, and faeries. I have written
   four novels and published stories in magazines like Penumbra and
   CrossedGenres.
   I recently finished the second draft of a nonfiction book, Recovering
   Agency: Lifting the Veil of Mormon Mind Control, due out Summer 2014.
