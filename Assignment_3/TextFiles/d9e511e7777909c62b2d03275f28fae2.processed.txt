     * spiritualinspiration: What a powerful promise we have from Almighty
       God! When we put our hope in Him, we will never be disappointed. Of
       course, that doesn’t mean that things will always go our way. There
       may be temporary disappointments, but we will never be permanently
       disappointed. Somewhere down the road, God will cause it to all
       work out for our good. With God on your side, you will always end
       in victory! Are you carrying frustration, worry or aggravation
       about something? That’s usually a clear sign that your hope is in
       the wrong place. If you hope in circumstances, it will deplete you
       of joy and peace. But when you turn those circumstances over to
       God, when you refuse to worry, when you refuse to allow the
       temporary things of this world to dictate your happiness, that’s
       when God can do a work in your life. When you trust in Him, He will
       make your crooked places straight; He will cause you to mount up
       with wings like the eagle. Today, choose to put your hope in the
       Father; you won’t be disappointed. Trust Him because He is
       faithful. Find rest for your soul in knowing that He is good, and
       He has good things in store for your future!

     * [7]spiritualinspiration: “…he who began a good work in you will
       carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus”
       (Philippians 1:6, NIV) Sometimes when God is doing a work in our
       lives, it can begin to feel a little uncomfortable. We may
       encounter people who are hard to get along with or have
       circumstances that seem beyond our control. When this happens,
       instead of complaining, getting sour or trying to change everything
       around you, why don’t you look deep inside and say, “Lord, thank
       You for doing a work in me.” See, I’ve learned that God is more
       interested in changing me than He is in changing my circumstances.
       If I choose to stay sour because I’m not getting my way or
       discouraged because things aren’t happening on my time table,
       that’s going to keep me right where I am. If you want to see
       change, if you want to see God open up new doors, the key is to
       bloom right where you’re planted. You can’t wait until everything
       gets better before you decide to have a good attitude. You have to
       be the best that you can be right where you are. When you bloom
       where you’re planted, you’re allowing God to work in you, and He
       will be faithful to complete what He’s started in you! A PRAYER FOR
       TODAYFather God, thank You for doing a work in me. I choose to
       align myself with Your plan by blooming where I’m planted. Help me,
       by Your Spirit, to be an example of Your love and life everywhere I
       go in Jesus’ name. Amen. [8]spiritualinspiration:

[25]Made for Him
       No one is truly free if he chooses to please others than choosing
       to please God. We were formed from His image, we were made to be
       loved by Him and in return we need to follow Him and with that, it
       means loving Him back by giving Him our lives.
       We don’t even own our lives, it’s His from the very beginning.
       Yes, I’ve been through struggle where I try to please the people
       around me, guys I want to hang out with rather than thinking of
       things I could do that will put a smile on my Creator’s face. Isn’t
       it pathetic?
       I’m writing this because it seems like nothing is happening to me
       for the past few days, weeks..seems like God is actually silent
       although I know in my heart that He isn’t, never will be. I
       honestly know that I will have a deeper relationship with Him when
       He gives me challenges and I’m through trials. I am in a current
       struggle, I need You Lord to be with me and my faith in You is
       tested during these times of silence.
       Reveal Your word to me Father.
       I really really really need You more than anything in my life.

[28]The Struggle and the Salvation.
       I have been into an account of struggles with the people around me
       which all do experience but with my situation being more or less
       pricking my faith.
       Those who criticize my Savior and it hurts even more to only listen
       and not defend Him because you have to respect their opinion as
       much as they respect yours. A fine struggle, a bagful of guilt you
       can only bear with such low esteem. Lord, I pray for those people
       who do not believe in You, who use the pain and hurt they are
       experiencing to question Your plans for them. I pray that sooner or
       later in Your perfect timing, You will reveal Yourself to them in a
       manner no one can explain. Open their hearts Father to listen to
       Your word and use their intellect to know You more and not to break
       their reason. This reason You have given us must be used for Your
       glory and knowing You deeper, it has never meant to detract us from
       the path You want us to tread.
       Give me the courage dear Lord to face these people and may You be
       seen in my life. It’s really indeed sad to think that some of my
       friends do not believe in You because of their own ridiculous
       reasons but all I am asking is that You would make me a good soul
       as I relay to them the joy that You have given me.
       I cry Lord for these people who abandon the thought of Your
       existence and glory. Make me an instrument Lord, please do so.

[42]Albeit
       I have been abandoning the idea and the activity of writing about
       my emotions because I do not want to revisit it someday and just
       hover with the idea again of feeling that way. I want to forget my
       emotions, may not be easy, but I want to do so simply because it
       never lasts and I do not want to get attached to it.
       Albeit a happy or a sad one, I just want to bury them in me like a
       uranium ore never to be dug out.
       I don’t keep a record anymore like I used to. Memories I learned to
       give away because I find it easier to meditate and focus on things
       that will come albeit sooner they will be the past too.
       Is this healthy? I guess so but I miss writing and a sad thing to
       admit is that emotions often are the fuel that drive us to write
       without draft. Such a sad thing to happen for a creative writer who
       used all inches of her emotions to give out a masterpiece. Now look
       at her, contented to write to and fro research proposals and boring
       outputs.
       It’s a choice maybe, but if ever I will get used to it, I won’t
       regret a damn thing I never kept track of what I felt.

     * spiritualinspiration: “The vision is yet for an appointed time…”
       (Habakkuk 2:3, NKJV) The scripture says, “The vision is for an
       appointed time.” That means there is a specific time already
       determined for the fulfillment of the desires God has placed in
       your heart. The appointed time is the best time! We have to trust
       that God can see the big picture for our lives. He knows what’s up
       ahead. He knows what we’re going to need, who we’re going to need,
       and when they need to show up. If God did everything we ask on our
       timetable, it would limit us because sometimes, what we’re asking
       for is too small. Sometimes the person we think we can’t live
       without, God knows in ten years they’re not going to be good for
       us. So He is closing the door right now. Sometimes the promotion we
       want so badly, if God gave it to us right now, He knows it would
       keep us from a much bigger promotion that He has three years down
       the road. Remember, God has the advantage of seeing it all. The
       longer I live, the more I trust Him. The more I see His hand of
       faithfulness, the more I know that His plan is better than my plan.
       Today, trust that He knows what He’s doing. Trust that He has an
       appointed time, and it is the best time to bring to pass His
       promises in your life!

     * [50]spiritualinspiration: If God made everything happen right away,
       or whenever we wanted it to happen, it wouldn’t require anything of
       us. We would miss the opportunity to grow because we grow in the
       difficult times. We grow when our faith is being stretched, when we
       have to believe when we don’t see any reason to believe, when we
       stay in faith when our mind is telling us we’re wasting our time,
       when we give God praise but we really feel like complaining. That’s
       passing the test. When you do that every day, your faith is not
       only increasing, your character is not only being developed, but
       you are one day closer to seeing the promise come to pass. Today,
       don’t give up on a promise just because you’ve been waiting a long
       time. Dig your heels in. Put on a new attitude. God is saying,
       “Every promise I’ve spoken over you, every dream I’ve placed in
       your spirit, even the secret petitions of your heart, the dreams
       you haven’t told anyone about, I still have every intention of
       bringing them to pass.” Stay close to Him. Obey His Word and move

     * Who wants to be lonely in a world that demands a life that needs a
       companion? A definition they perfectly made for a person whom you
       share your thoughts, emotions, time and frantic vulnerability with.
       How hard it is to meet that person, how tragic it is to be alone.
       That, is what social media and the people all around you displays
       in your window..talk about pathetic, talk about telling these
       things and not being bitter.
       Things do not always go our way, they have never been made to
       submit in our randomness and instability of emotions. That is why
       we need a superior Being to lead us, Somebody who knows better than
       us, Somebody who sees the whole picture and not a portion of it. It
       is but God.
       We make a perfect check list of the person who we want to end up
       with. A fleeting time comes and all the boxes have been checked but
       we still feel indifferent or so. This is because we haven’t
       submitted that checklist to God, we haven’t prayed for it, we just
       went our own way and submitted to our selfishness instead of His
       wisdom.
       Why do we need to consult Him? Or the right question is, why should
       we seek a person that has his heart set for God?
       Let’s talk about reality here. Men and women who go to church, sit
       on pews and never miss a Bible study are not perfect, but good
       suggestions for a partner. But let us try to examine those people’s
       hearts. Let us venture out to those who do not attend church
       regularly, look at their hearts and see if we have something to
       get. We must not judge, however we were led to be in that
       character.
       A person who loves God and prioritizes Him more than you is a man
       we ought to seek. That person will never hurt you, he will cherish
       you for the love you give to him is inspired by God and he knows
       well it is not a toy to be played. You are a music to his soul, his
       anchor at times he feels disturbed, the one that helps him to know
       God, a person who you can grow in love and faith with.
       But it takes time and patience to find that person.
       Let us not lose our standards and commit to the empty promises of
       this world. It has always been meant to disappoint, let us not hear
       its voices, let us not conform with it. We are not meant to live in
       it, we were built for eternity. We were made for more.

”Can a mortal ask questions which God finds unanswerable? Quite easily, I
should think. All nonsense questions are unanswerable. How many hours are
there in a mile? Is yellow square or round? Probably half the questions we
ask - half our great theological and metaphysical problems - are like that.
