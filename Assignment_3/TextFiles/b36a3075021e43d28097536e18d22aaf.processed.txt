   eleven

   by tom rogers

   the journey of a boy turning eleven on 9/11

“A thoroughly engaging piece about a very difficult subject. Very well
written – funny and emotional from beginning to end. And I loved Radar.”

   — Alan Horn, Chairman, The Walt Disney Studios

The Book

   [14]book-cover
   Alex Douglas always wanted to be a hero. But nothing heroic ever
   happened to Alex. Nothing, that is, until his eleventh birthday. When
   Alex rescues a stray dog as a birthday gift to himself, he doesn’t
   think his life can get much better. Radar, his new dog, pretty much
   feels the same way. But this day has bigger things in store for both of
   them.

   This is a story about bullies and heroes. About tragedy and hope. About
   enemies with two legs and friends with four, and pesky little sisters
   and cranky old men, and an unexpected lesson in kindness delivered with
   a slice of pizza.

   This is Eleven: the journey of a boy turning eleven on 9/11.

Chapter Excerpts

You Smell Like a Monkey

   Chapter 4 excerpt

   8:05 a.m.

   The yellow bus rumbled through a tumbledown section of town, an
   industrial no-man’s-land of railroad tracks, warehouses, and empty
   factories with broken windows and rusted steel roofs. The bus didn’t
   stop here, because no kids lived here.

   The sound of the tires changed to a high-pitched hum as the bus crossed
   a tall bridge that soared over a rail yard and a narrow river. Alex
   turned to look out the window …

A Dog’s Life

   Chapter 10 excerpt

   10:34 a.m.

   “Here, Max.”

   Alex called to the dog, who had stopped to sniff a light pole. The dog
   didn’t respond but moved on to investigate a trash can.

   Nunu looked at him funny. “Who’s Max?”

   “I’m trying out my top ten dog names. Does he look like a Max to you?”

   Alex made a face. “Muffin?” …

The Man in the White Shirt

   Chapter 13 excerpt

   10:02 a.m.

   The Man in the White Shirt staggered through the choking gray cloud. He
   couldn’t see where he was going. He couldn’t see anything.

   He nearly crashed into a light pole that appeared a foot in front of
   him.

   He heard others around him, panting as they ran.

   Someone slammed into him from behind and then disappeared into the
   cloud …
