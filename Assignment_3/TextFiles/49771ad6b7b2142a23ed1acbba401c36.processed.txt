[3]RIP Cartoonist Pran

   There's something about comic books and train journeys that binds them
   together. Whenever I travel by train, I try to squeeze in a few minutes
   to reach the books and comics hawker and grab a few comic books. I do
   this even when I am carrying my own book to read. When I look back, I
   think Chacha Chaudhary and his creator Pran are to be thanked for this
   tiny custom. The bond between train journeys and Chacha Chaudhary comic
   books seems to be hidden in the perspective that they both offer about
   the idyllic Indian life.
   It's highly possible that the first book outside the curriculum that I
   laid my hands on was a Chacha Chaudhary comic. I remember the plots
   being high on simplicity and the language as chaste as textbook Hindi.
   They were childishly funny and interesting; clearly aimed at younger
   readers.
   Chachaji has no superpower except that his brain works faster than a
   computer. Most of the stories started off with Chachaji at his home
   struggling in a friendly tiff with his wife. A police officer would
   approach Chachaji and ask for his help in solving a tough case. With
   his brain and his accomplice Sabu's thew, the case would be solved in
   about four pages. Most of the stories were signed off with a signature
   "Chalo Sabu," from Chachaji. An extreme show of brainpower came with a
   footnote: 'Chacha Chaudhary's brain works faster than a computer'. A
   panel with a volcanic eruption on Jupiter appeared immediately after a
   panel that depicted Sabu's anger. The footnote said: "Sabu's anger
   leads to an volcanic eruption on Jupiter". You could tell a bad guy by
   his name - Baarood Singh, Gobar Singh, Dhamaka Singh, etc. The
   backgrounds in all the panels were simple with just rectangular blocks
   for buildings. Homes and offices looked the same except that homes had
   clothes drying out on their windows. Every action sequence appeared
   with a sound. Ratatatat for firing of bullets, dhadaam for blasts,
   kikkkk for kick, bhadaam for a punch and hooo-hoooba when Sabu lifted
   heavy things. What fun! I guess it was even the pictorial depiction
   that got me so involved. There was hardly any detailing to the
   backgrounds. But all areas seemed just as they should be - without any
   crowd and with open spaces.
   Here are a couple of plots that I remember:
     * A dwarfish weightlifter named Piddi challenges people to lift
       bulldozers. Piddi lifts his bulldozer easily while the other person
       struggles to even move his bulldozer. Then Chacha Chaudhary finds
       out that Piddi's bulldozer is made of thermocol while the other
       bulldozer is made of steel.
     * A customs officer asks Chacha Chaudhary to come to airport as he
       suspects a possible smuggling of drugs. Chachaji and Sabu are taken
       near an airplane where passengers (after having gone through
       security check) are queued up. Chacha's dog Raaket whiffs out the
       drugs stashed in a huge boil on the forehead of a cancer patient
       and that's the end of it.

   The only series of books that I remember which was dedicated to one
   particular villain was the Raka one. This guy is the biggest nemesis of
   Chacha Chaudhary. I remember he was shrunk, captured in a bottle and
   thrown down an ocean. But he returned. Then he was sent off to another
   planet. But he returned (using a couple's satellite who decide to land
   on that planet and collect some material)! I think currently he's
   locked up in some cave. This was easily the best set of books in the
   series.
   I remember the first page of the comic that gave a brief profile of the
   creator. This profile had the exact same words and never changed. It
   said that he was born in Kasoor which is now in Pakistan. His cartoon
   strips are in some museum in America. He also holds some Limca record.
   Back then, he didn't really seem to be a big deal actually. Whenever I
   looked at his picture, he didn't come across as somebody who'd be into
   making cartoon sketches himself. Donning a wide smile and a posh suit,
   he seemed like somebody who owned the company that had hired some
   hundreds of cartoonists. It was only after the Chach Chaudhary series
   began airing on TV that I read up about Pran.
   To my surprise, he was the force behind it all! The creator! Despite
   the advancements in animation technology, he used to sketch on paper.
   Talk about being a purist. I read a couple of his interviews where he
   talked about starting off in the 1960s as a small time cartoonist with
   the Shrimatiji series. This series that depicts the daily struggles of
   an Indian housewife is still published in some magazines. When asked
   about what made him start Chacha Chaudhary, he talked about creating a
   character that would appeal to the masses and was distinctly different
   from the western comic superhero characters like Mandrake, Phantom,
   etc. As a result, characters like Pinki, Billu, and Raman took form.
   They too had no special powers except the occasional comic instances in
   their lives. He wanted Indian cartoonists to be original in their work
   instead of imitating the works of established cartoonists abroad. He
   wished for a greater recognition for Indian cartoonists with possibly a
   museum dedicated to their work.
   I heard about the news of Pran's demise this morning and my mind went
   back to those amazing days when I spent time with my collection of
   Diamond comics. I read some of them again and again even though I knew
   what was coming next and in fact, knew the lines by heart. It is thanks
   to his simple books that the first seeds of reading were sown in me. It
   was his creativity that had me engrossed in the simplest of tales. With
   all the short stories bound together in comic books and sweet memories,
   I am sure Pran has had an influence on what I have turned out to be. It
   must've been a struggle for him to take his characters from humble
   magazine strips to such a mass-scale publication when cartoons were
   hardly recognized by the Indian middle-5class. I am sure there are so
   many out there thanking him for sticking around. There's immense
   respect for somebody who creates something that is loved by the masses
   for half a century. May there be more Prans who drench our souls in the
   flow of their creativity. May there be immense recognition and reward
   for them.
   It seems like the inner child in the superior power is in desperate
   need of some lighthearted laughter. Rest in peace, Pran.

[15]Goa Trip

   Somewhere around in June, a friend whom I had last met around five
   years ago, messaged to ask if I am free in the last week of July for a
   three-day road trip with two other friends. I instantly decided to join
   in. We kept going back and forth while finalizing the plan. Eventually,
   the full-fledged road trip plan was cancelled since a
   soon-to-be-married friend's family/soon-to-be-family told him that a
   road trip might not be safe. Finally, we decided to meet in Goa and
   take things up from there. Meanwhile, we asked friends on social
   networks about the best pubs, places to visit, etc. knowing fully well
   that we won't be going to any of them.
   The anticipation for the trip showed itself in the form of countdown
   messages like 'Only a month to go', 'Just a fortnight more', and 'Next
   Saturday it begins' that we sent each other on the messaging group.
   I had a stopover at Mumbai airport for a couple of hours. If you're
   looking for an in-your-face scam, look no further than the prices at an
   airport food-court. The ideal place to sit at the 1A terminal
   food-court is the long table that has charging points. It's an
   enjoyable experience to watch people roam around looking at the
   foodstuff, checking out the prices, getting disappointed and going back
   hungrily to their seats in the company of their gadgets. If only WiFi
   connections could feed us... Look out of the window and there's a
   thoroughly contrasting life of slum-dwellers.
   "Can I make a call from your phone? I don't have STD on my phone,"
   somebody said while I was lost in the dark world of A Feast for Crows.
   "Sure," I said and asked him the number. He turned out to be from
   Hyderabad as evidenced by his Hyderabadi accent. I chirped a bit with
   him in Hindi only so that I could amuse myself with his Hyderabadi
   accent.
   The flight was as bland as the cookies that it offered. The only
   chuckle arrived in the form of an aunty's question. She asked if she
   could have a look at the book that I was reading.
   "Which number book is this in the series?", she asked.
   "It's the fourth book," I answered.
   "Have you read the previous three too?", she asked.
   I was stunned as my soul rolled in laughter.
   I had heard that summer and monsoon are off-seasons for Goa. However,
   the Dabolim airport didn't bear any testimony to this. It was abuzz
   with passengers. I remembered what our pilot had said after landing -
   "There's no off season in Goa." The toilets were full and there was at
   least a kilometre long queue at the ladies' toilet - a rare
   disadvantage of being a lady.
   The taxi rules seemed to have changed at the airport and I could take a
   taxi only through the prepaid counters. I remember the last time I was
   there, I had ventured outside the airport building and the drivers had
   offered cheaper fares.
   "So when are you leaving?", the taxi driver asked me as soon as I sat.
   Of course, he was desperate for more business and I managed to extract
   a Rs.100 discount on return fare. He asked if I wanted a place to stay
   or a vehicle on hire or cheap alcohol or some company of girls. Such a
   diversified business was last displayed by the Tata group. Traffic is a
   funny business in Goa. The taxi driver brought excitement into the
   seemingly boring task of driving by engaging into smoking, talking on
   his phone about getting a Portuguese citizenship, and leaning out of
   the window to clean the windshield. There was a time when he did all
   three of these together and I was thinking which of my possessions
   would interest the first person who finds my body. Then the taxi-driver
   asked me where Nagpur is. When I told him that it's near Hyderabad, he
   asked if there's no direct flight from Hyderabad. I was on the verge of
   drawing the map of India in order to explain him that Nagpur and
   Hyderabad are two different cities.
   By the time, I reached the hotel, my friends had left for a beach. They
   promised to return within thirty minutes and asked me to freshen up.
   "People with clean souls don't need to freshen up," I told myself and
   roamed around the hotel to see if I could dig into some fish and pacify
   the parched throat. Alas! Goa off-season struck. Most of the places
   were closed. Fish was at exorbitantly high prices. Thankfully, friends
   arrived soon after. Meeting somebody after years comes with this extra
   discomfort of hesitant hugs where you don't know if you have to hug or
   shake a hand and land up awkwardly somewhere in between.
   We went to Chapora fort to revive the memories of good ol' Dil Chahta
   Hai. Parking a car outside the fort is a bitch thanks to the steep
   slope and I had to struggle while making the car stop. It was so damn
   difficult that I almost decided to jump out of the vehicle while it was
   still rolling down. Thankfully, a friend took the reins and parked it
   as desired. The friends who had gotten down kept giggling throughout my
   battle with parking.
   Chapora fort, did I say? More like Chapora wall. There's nothing that
   resembles a fort except a keep in one corner and a mighty gate. Well,
   whatever it is, the view from the top is amazing. We spent a few
   moments looking at the sea and pondered over thoughts like if one
   starts swimming from here, how long will it take to reach Africa. We
   got out of a small door of the fort and walked down a bit further into
   a flat area that looks into the sea. A friend decided not to come down
   because he'd had a 'life-threatening slip on the pebbles because of his
   slippery slippers'. This became our teasing weapon throughout the tour
   and we kept asking him if he's comfortable in the car and is sure that
   he won't slip.
   The off-season ghost haunted us during dinner too as most of the
   roadside little eateries offering nice yet cheap meals and
   accompaniments were closed. I asked the sea-food craving monster inside
   me to go to sleep and not to wake up until this trip is over.
   The next day we decided to go beach hopping in South Goa. Our hotel had
   a complimentary breakfast. It included the cheapest and worst tasting
   jam and butter. Anyway, we had to have something to replace hunger with
   food.
   We started off with Pallolem beach. It was quite breezy and the sea
   seemed upset. We saw a few fishermen taking their boat out of the
   water. It was a struggle to keep it calm in those restless waters. They
   had a long rope going into the sea. A fishing net was obviously at work
   at its end. We asked a fisherman how quickly the net would be drawn
   out. "An hour," he told. We walked around with the aim of reaching a
   group of rocks at one end of the beach. The walking trail took us
   through a small village and we were lost for a few minutes. Walking
   through densely grown plants showed us that the mosquitoes weren't
   having an off-season. The rocky place turned out to be surrounded by
   extremely dirty water. The villagers had been clearly using it for
   purposes other than fishing.
   Dudhsagar falls were on our plan but we were not quite sure about how
   to reach there. We met an uncle while looking for the way back from the
   rocky part of the beach and asked him about the way to Dudhsagar. First
   he said, "You have phones, right? Look up the maps in your phone and
   go." Wow! Then he said that he provides jeep for the tour but not in
   this season. More uncertainty. By the time we made it back to the
   beach, the fishermen had taken their net out and it was full of fish
   and crabs. It didn't seem to be a big loot though.
   We left the Pallolem beach to reach Agonda beach. It was quite remote
   and there was absolutely nobody except for the four of us and the
   lifeguards. This one was more beautiful and serene than the Pallolem
   beach.
   It was late afternoon by the time we reached the town of Margao. We
   parked the car near a sweets shop that also offered samosas and
   kachoris. The search for a decent eating place turned out to be rather
   disappointing as almost everything, except the bakeries, was closed. We
   decided to stick to the sweets shop. Being so starved meant that the
   first few sips of tea seemed like the first drops of rain on a sap in a
   desert. The shop had run out of samosas. But the kachoris were quite
   decent too and turned out be our only lunch.
   Next, we headed our wheels towards Aguada fort. We saw the Kingfisher
   mansion on the way. A couple of us toyed with the idea of having a look
   at the vintage cars inside but then rain and our tired bodies made us
   decide against it. It was almost sunset when we made it to Candolim
   beach. This one had a few people. The breeze was extremely pleasant;
   one that'd make you look deep into the sea and think about useless
   things like the purpose of life. We decided to eat a little something
   at the 'Sunny Side Up' restaurant at the beach. Here we learnt that
   fishing is prohibited at many beaches during monsoon and they have to
   transport seafood from the beaches where it is allowed. This shoots up
   its price during the off-season.
   After our dinner, we roamed around in the seemingly hip areas that host
   pubs like Titos, Mambos, Mambas and similar sounding words. The streets
   were full of guys. The looks on their faces suggested that they were
   expecting to be swooped up by girls in bikinis arriving straight from
   heaven. We kept driving until we reached a place that was so deserted
   and had the airs of being haunted. The walls around had words like
   tantra/mantra and we hurried back to the hotel. Dudhsagar was on the
   cards for the next day and based on inputs from rather untrustworthy
   sources, we decided to leave for Kulem station early morning.
   The dread of the horrible breakfast was soon overtaken by the joy of
   the lovely road that leads up to Kulem. It was surrounded by a dense
   cover of trees on both sides and had frequent ups and downs that made
   the ride thoroughly delightful. Even when we reached Kulem, we didn't
   quite know our way to Dudhsagar. A few locals offered to take us
   pillion on bikes for around Rs.700 for a two-way ride. At the Kulem
   station, more uncertainty followed as there was only one train to
   Castle Rock and it didn't even stop at Dudhsagar which was
   inconveniently located mid-way between Kulem and Castle Rock. The only
   solution was to take the train to Castle Rock and take another train
   back that halted at Dudhsagar. But from there, there was no other train
   and we were to walk back 12.5 kms.! The stationmaster heard our
   disappointment at the prospect of walking and gave us a line to keep
   our hopes high - "Kuchh paane ke liye kuchh khona bhi padta hai."
   We pleaded the train driver to make a stop at Dudhsagar. Some dude
   quoted a figure of 200 people who wanted to get down at Dudhsagar but
   the train driver refused plainly. During our journey to Castle Rock, we
   got a good look at the falls. It was funny how people at the falls
   hi-ho'd at us train passengers as if they were teasing us. Castle Rock
   station seemed to be on the verge of being taken over by plants. Almost
   every exposed area was under a carpet of algae. We had tea on the
   station and got the much needed tar-o-taazgi. We asked the
   stationmaster if there'd at least be a goods train to carry us from
   Dudhsagar. He said that there won't be any more trains in the day after
   the passenger train that dropped us off at Dudhsagar. The unreserved
   compartments of the train from Castle Rock to Dudhsagar were completely
   packed and utterly filthy so like law-breaking posh citizens, we
   entered the reserved compartment  The ticket checker dutifully asked us
   to go to the unreserved compartment. We merely switched from one
   reserved compartment to another.
   We reached Dudhsagar falls and what a sight it was to have a look at it
   up close! I have never seen any waterfall as big as this one. It was
   big not just in height but also in width. We oooh-aaah'd at the fall
   for sometime. Now the toughest task began - walking back to Kulem for
   12.5 kms. There is no separate walking track and one has to walk along
   the train tracks which is full of rocks.
   Walking through tunnels is a different experience altogether as they're
   pitch dark in the middle portion. Also, their narrowness doesn't make a
   happy experience. If you're on the side of the track and a train
   approaches, all you'll be able to do is cling to the nearby wall (which
   might be soaked or worse still - have snakes or rats on it). While we
   were about to enter one such tunnel, we heard a train's horn. We
   thought that it was far way away. But towards the last few meters of
   the tunnel, it became clear that the train was quite close and was
   coming at us at a scary speed! We dashed out of the tunnel just in the
   nick of time and had a hearty laugh about it. Talk about being Aamir
   Khan in Ghulam!
   We saw a small automatic carriage carrying a bunch of people on the
   track. We asked them to let us get on it but they turned us down.
   "You're too many," one of them said. Four of us? Too many? In India?
   Sonalim is a station between Dudhsagar and Kulem which offered us the
   much-needed shelter during a slightly harsh rainfall that appeared just
   as the automatic carriage ignored us. The stationmaster told us that
   the falls had hardly any visitors until they were recently featured in
   the movie Chennai Express. He also told us that the automatic carriage
   is only for saahibs. This one had come from Hubli. May his shoe lose
   its sole for not taking us on-board! The writing was clear on the wall
   of this small station. Kulem was a good 8 kms. away. The stationmaster
   then asked us to go away because our talking was disturbing him in his
   communication with the aliens.
   After walking a few more kilometres (around 4 which seemed like 400),
   an old man was walking with us. He asked us to stop the approaching
   goods train. The goods train passed us and we requested the person in
   the last carriage to make it stop. But it kept running away from us. We
   had gotten used to this kind of disappointment by now. But then it
   magically slowed down. We unleashed our inner Usain Bolt and started
   running towards it. Then it picked speed again. Bloody hell! We thought
   the train driver was playing a trick on us. And then suddenly it
   stopped. We made a dash towards it again and caught it. Phew! After
   walking 8 kms, the joy derived by catching something that would carry
   you for 4 kms is difficult to put in words. The crowd on the train had
   a cruel laugh at us. They had walked back to Dudhsagar station and had
   asked the station master to flag down this goods train. We reached
   Kulem, made it back to our hotel, dined and slept.
   The next day was the day of departure from Goa. We talked about going
   for a similar trip again. We all knew that it won't happen any time
   soon. May be it won't happen ever. But if a chance arrives, I'll
   definitely be in.
   Besides the whole experience of visiting amazing places, this short
   trip was memorable because of the endless talks that touched important
   topics like why are there no girls in bikinis in this season, why's
   this an off-season in Goa, how can we improve access to remote touristy
   places, evolution of life, end of world, etc. All the talks were kept
   alive and kicking by random lines from Andaz Apna Apna, Vicky Donor,
   Khosla ka Ghosla and Dil Chahta Hai.
   Wish there are more such fun times with friends. With a nice company,
   there can be no off-seasons.

[28]A Bit about Coffee

   In my part of the world, for ages unfathomed, "Tea please," used to be
   the most probable and ideal response most of our guests would give to
   the question - "What will you have - tea or coffee?". In fact, it was
   so customary, that so many days had passed between our coffee purchase
   and the dawn of its use that, forget the expiry date, we couldn't even
   read the brand name on our coffee bottle.
   When we finally got the 'I'll have coffee' response from an uncle, the
   talk of the household was that, "Now that this person is
   a proven menace to the society, we should cut off all ties with him."
   Almost agreeing with our worries, we found that the monsoon moisture
   had devoured a better part of the coffee and had left a symbolic lump
   in the throat of the coffee bottle. It was to our pleasant reprieve
   when the uncle's wife said, "Don't worry. He doesn't really know what
   real coffee tastes like and you might even pass off tea as coffee and
   he'll remark, "It's quite strong. Just the way I like it.' I have even
   given him Bournvita and have still managed to extract exactly the same
   response."
   Having grown up in a household that's so passionately hostile to
   coffee, it's nothing short of a shame that I do not quite recollect
   when or how I had my first cup of coffee. But my guess is that, like a
   first time adoration for a movie star, it must have happened sometime
   during a night of intensely educational rote learning. Or it could have
   simply been a whim of the curious that made me have a hot liquid
   version of the coffee toffee. When I lived away from home, coffee was
   what my day began with. The love grew stronger with the strength of the
   coffee and every cup was a toast to the seemingly never-ending affair.
   Corporate offices introduced me to machine coffee. Whoa! You hold a cup
   under a coffee tap, press a button and bhzzzzzzzzz the coffee pours
   out. Besides, there's nobody to keep a track of how many cups you gulp
   down in a day. Is the idea of heaven built around the concept of coffee
   machine? How about I get a tap diverted to my desk? The excitement of
   machine coffee died down with the first sip. It was as if tea was being
   jealous of coffee and was pouring itself out of the designated outlet.
   Sometimes it was just cardamom water. Sigh, the betrayal.
   It wasn't long before I got sucked into one of the coffee cafes. I kept
   thinking why'd anybody start a coffee cafes business. Aren't the
   roadside folks making great coffee already? Living in a cave meant I
   had an unashamed and complete lack of knowledge of types of coffee and
   the sort of experience people look for while indulging in the
   horrendous act of meeting each other. I don't remember whom I met the
   first time I visited a coffee shop, but I quite remember the coffee. It
   was nice and creamy though extremely costly. It had a weird shape made
   of cream on top of it. For a moment, I kept wondering whether it's a
   heart or a butt.
   I dislike the concept of coffee shops. They make a nice place to listen
   to loud music and look at college kids bursting with energy enough to
   giggle non-stop for a day. But they're not a great place to have
   coffee. I'd be a liar if I say that their coffee isn't nice. There have
   been times when their coffee was so good that it is with my tongue that
   I've rolled out money notes from my wallet.
   Then there's this seemingly never-ending global experiment that goes
   around in an effort to obtain a nearly perfect coffee from mixing the
   contents of coffee sachets, milk powder and hot water. This happens
   when you are trapped in the murk of airports, airplanes or costly
   hotels. You take the coffee powder, milk powder and hot water in any
   proportion and in any order and, without failure, you end up with
   something that tastes utterly horrible.
   I don't understand people who compare coffee with tea. Of course, taste
   is a matter of personal choice but really, tea lovers, how can you even
   love tea? That too when you have to have biscuits to go along with it.
   Thankfully, coffee has no such rotten partners to spoil its effect. The
   taste-buds of people who have cookies, cakes or pastries with coffee
   deserve all the sympathy from the universe.
   It may be as useless as any other form of love but my love for coffee
   has offered me the answer to the hypothetical question, 'What would you
   do if you had only an hour to live?'. I'd grab my cup and sit out in
   the garden looking at the trees. Rainfall and a Gulzar song would be
   such a beautiful combination to go with the setting. It'd be quite
   magical how one'd move the spoon in the cup and feel the soul
   stirring.
