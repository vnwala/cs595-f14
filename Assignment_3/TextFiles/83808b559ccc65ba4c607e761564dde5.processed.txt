I Know These Things to Be True

   Expression makes my world go 'round.

06 August 2014

[3]:*

   I crave touch. And my very favorite touch is the touch of lips. There's
   something thrillingly delightful about lips. Specifically, kissing. I
   love to kiss. When the opportunity is afforded me, I kiss frequently.
   Playfully, tenderly, passionately, sweetly, interspersing nuzzles,
   whispers, nibbles, licks and giggles. Kissing is amazing and beautiful
   and intimate.
   Compared to my friends at the time, I was a late bloomer when it came
   to kissing. I was 13 and despite several illicit games of Truth or Dare
   and Spin the Bottle, I'd somehow managed to avoid anything more than
   kisses on cheeks, neck nuzzles and booty rubs. I had a boyfriend at the
   time. A boy two years my senior who made every effort to get us time
   and space alone. I, on the other hand, endeavored to do the same but
   in... less obvious ways. I spent a large amount of time at church and,
   at the time, he and I didn't attend the same school. He'd started
   showing up at my church with his boys (didn't we all travel in packs)
   and, eventually, our groups melded into a group of couplings. Youth
   retreats and rallies and camping were events that brought on renewed
   excitement when you knew you could sit next to your boo and canoodle
   during travel to and fro. It was at one such event that my first kiss
   finally happened!
   We were at an event late. Meals had been eaten. Laughs had been had. I
   was basking in the glow of teen happiness when I suddenly had an urgent
   need for my lip balm. It was pineapple-mango scented and flavored and I
   kept having to reapply it because I was constantly licking it off my
   lips. Somehow, I'd left this new wonder in the van and I wandered to
   the parking lot to retrieve it. Walking back to the building, with my
   lips slathered in deliciousness, I encountered my boyfriend. The sun
   had just dipped below the horizon and the lights in the parking lot
   were beginning to flicker on. He pulled me into a hug and I eagerly
   leaned into him. I'm not sure what compelled me to look up into his
   face. Just like that, with the tilt of my head and the briefest inhale,
   I'd embarked on my first kiss. It was like many of life's other firsts,
   exciting, terrifying, full of fumbles, but triumphant. I remember
   pulling back and smacking my lips together. He tasted of Winterfresh
   gum and now I did, too. I wondered if he was tasting pineapple-mango.
   He looked at me expectantly and it occurred to me that I had no  clue
   what was supposed to happen after a kiss in real life. My TV/movie
   research and practice had not prepared me for what was supposed to
   happen after the kiss. I wracked my brain and kept coming up empty.
   So.
   I thanked him. And because he was barely more well-versed in life as I
   was, he said, "You're welcome."
   And that is the story of my first delicious kiss. My technique has
   improved since that evening. I rarely use flavored lip products and I
   don't know when I last tasted Winterfresh. But when I think of that gum
   and when I think of flavored lip balm, I always fondly remember that
   first kiss.

[8]Unsaid Words

   I sat quietly, sitting in the middle of a scene from which I was
   inadvertently excluded. My mother was telling a joke that she clearly
   found hilarious, as she dissolved into peals of laughter before she'd
   arrived at the punch line. I watched my brothers roll their eyes in
   amusement and knew that if I could see myself an indulgent smile would
   be playing over my lips. I looked at my mother, still mid-laugh but
   pretending to be grumpy that none of us were laughing as uproariously
   as she was. Clearly, our senses of humor weren't sophisticated enough
   for her caliber of joke. I had something I needed to tell her. And I
   worried that after we talked, she would never look like this again.
   Happy. No, more than happy---joyous. An abiding joy that resided within
   her, regardless of what else she went through.
   My mother has encouraged me to do things that would create happy
   memories. While we were growing up she would spend hours regaling us
   with stories from her childhood and stories her parents had told her
   from their childhoods. As a young girl, I worried that I wouldn't live
   my life well enough to regale my future progeny with such enthralling
   stories. I still worry about that. But these memories are shocking in
   their unpleasantness. I'm not sure why it's so important to me to talk
   with my mother about these things.
   I've always felt that my mother and I were at odds. She loved me, of
   that I had no doubt. However, it was clear that our personalities were
   at opposite ends of the spectrum. Our rough patch began when I was 16
   and it endured until I was 24. I was determined to assert my
   personality but after a lifetime of never seeing this sassy, defiant,
   cold-eyed side of me, my mother felt certain that what she was seeing
   wasn't really me.
   It was. I'd just finally found my voice. But the voice I'd found was
   still unable to tell my mother the things I should have told her when I
   was 7, 8, and 9 years old. I couldn't speak the things that had plagued
   me at 15 and 19. The years went on and I found myself choking over all
   the unsaid words. Every conversation was a minefield and I was
   constantly and obviously tense. Who am I to dash her knowledge of me to
   the ground? To dig up my long-buried hurts and display them before her
   like a dog with a favorite bone? What right do I have?
   Two teenage boys, the sons of family friends who we hadn't seen in over
   15 years. Their names were as ashes, dusted out of my mind as though a
   great wind had swept them away. Separate occasions, years apart, but
   somehow mirroring one another in the terror, the confusion, the guilt
   that welled up within me. I locked it all away for years, tucking it
   neatly into a chest that was welded shut. I had no need to revisit.
   Ever.
   It happened again. Someone I trusted, someone who'd been a safe harbor.
   We were in what I thought was a safe space. There, he pressed his
   advantage. The chest cracked, the contents seeped out. They'd been
   stewing, rotting for years. An ingredient added...
   I was lost. I was to blame. I had to be. Something was wrong with me.
   The last time it happened I determined it would be the last. And it
   was. Unlike any time before, this man intended to press to completion.
   And he took. The last time it happened I determined it would be the
   last. And it was. Any other encounter would be on my terms and my terms
   only.
   I looked at my mother with laughter in her eyes, telling a story she'd
   told us dozens of times and singing a song she'd learned as a child. I
   searched her face, searing everything about her in my memory. Because
   if I uncorked this bottle, spilled out my hurts, sipped the bitter
   elixir and faced the aftereffects... this would be the last time I saw
   her this way.

   He found her at her worst.
   Her hard exterior cracked, exposing her tender innards. She trembled
   when he came near and hesitated when he smiled. Her past acceptance of
   gentleness and kindness had caused her to lay her soul bare. It was
   certainly her soul that suffered the most when that gentleness and
   kindness slipped away to the place where sweet feelings go to die.
   This approach was very different but smacked of more of the same. With
   shadowed memories crowding her mind, she changed her tact. She felt
   certain this could be different. This would be different.
   After all, she was a changed SHE. And HE was certainly a different HE.
   He found her at her worst and she strove to be her best. Now, she knew
   it was different. She did more for herself while with him. She wanted
   more for him. She dreamed bigger dreams, reached for higher peaks. In a
   twinkle of happiness, a flash of laughter, a burst of embraces, it was
   over.
   He found her at her worst. And when he was done with her, he put her
   back where he'd found her.

[19]And He Knew

   The rain pelted the windows as the parking lot lights seemed to glare
   between the blinds. The wind screeched past, proclaiming the chill it
   would leave to greet them the next morning. He rolled onto his side and
   reached out in a gesture that had somehow become automatic. Every time
   he touched her, he still wondered how her skin was so soft. He’d
   showered with her; even used the same products, but she her skin was
   impossibly soft to the touch. He trailed his hand down her spine,
   testing to see if she was awake. He almost felt her smile in the dark
   as she rolled toward him. “Yes,” she queried. The single word dripped
   with the strangest combination of mirth and sensuality. She scooted
   closer to him bringing the heat that she literally seemed to radiate
   from her body. He wondered how someone who was always shivering from
   cold managed to give off so much heat. He kissed her forehead and
   caressed her cheek, enjoying the freedom to touch her at will. She lay
   still, curled in his arms as he ran his hand smoothly down the line of
   her body. Following her arm to her hip to her thigh, he paused to
   tickle the sensitive spot behind her knee. He loved to feel her squirm
   next to him and continued to tease her in these little ways. She
   giggled, releasing a short burst of minty breath onto him. He knew that
   she would never know much how he loved these moments with her. Her
   happiness was nearly tangible. And it warmed his heart in an
   inexplicable way. He smiled as he listened to her fuss about being
   unable to doze off, and moments later, he listened to her breathing
   become even as sleep claimed her. She never went willingly, but she
   always went quickly. He leaned away to look down at her sleeping face
   and placed a gentle kiss on her forehead.
   And he knew it .  He loved her.

[25]Sickening

   My skin tingled as it cooled. He stood beside my bed, his shadow
   falling across my midsection as he shrugged into the shirt I’d hastily
   snatched from his body hours ago. “This isn’t working out,” he said.
   “This?” “Yeah,” he replied, “this. Us. We. It’s not working for me
   anymore.” I grunted, choosing not to speak than to spew the acidic
   words I was feeling. I sat up, pulling the sheet to cover my bare
   breasts. Some part of me would not allow me to be dismissed from his
   life while lying naked in the afterglow he’d created. I felt the warmth
   draining out of me. I climbed out of the bed, both irate and unsure of
   what to do now that I stood before him. Our juices trickled down my
   thighs, causing the sheet to stick to the intimate crevices he’d so
   ardently caressed moments before. A thrill ran down my spine, my
   attraction to him nearly overpowering my growing disgust. “What is it
   that suddenly isn’t working, Brian?” His gaze went blank, as it always
   did when he was confronted. His face was absolutely still; he didn’t
   attempt to look like he was thinking of an answer. He just shook his
   head and turned away. I felt something inside me deflate. Suddenly I
   felt wretched and cheap. I imagined this moment painted. A woman,
   clutching a sheet to her breasts, standing in the shadow of a man who
   no longer wanted her. Her face dejected as he gave her his back. Her
   shoulders trembling in an effort not to slump. The woman I imagined was
   me, and she was sickening.

[31]Things He Love(d)

   He loved her lips. Truly, the credit was due to her mouth, although her
   lips were nothing to discount. He was fascinated by the constant
   motion. He would see her, sitting or standing utterly still and there
   it would be. A glimmer of action on her face. It made him smile just to
   think of it. He wondered if she knew she was doing it. No, he decided,
   definitely not.
   He’d been so immersed in watching her mouth that he had only half-heard
   what she was saying. He watched as she paused and applied gloss to her
   lips. He laughed, poking gentle fun at her to cover his affection. “Now
   why would you need to make your lips stand out more?” He knew he
   certainly didn’t need any more excuses to look at them. She smirked,
   the corner of her mouth adding a curious twitch that intrigued him.
   “Boy, please,” she laughed, “you can look away if you have a problem
   with it.” It was as if she was reading his mind.
   He eyed the beauty mark on her upper lip and fought the urge to run the
   pad of his thumb across it. Her silence marked the wait for a question
   he’d never heard. She shook her head, amused at his distractedness
   tonight. He was usually an avid listener, a pretend-reluctant
   participant in their roundabout conversations. He focused himself,
   really listened to what she was saying. He loved this game. He’d charm
   laughs out of her, waiting for his name, mingled with mirth roll from
   her tongue. Her eyes would sparkle in such a way that he had not
   recalled ever seeing before, piquing his curiosity to learn how deep
   the sparkle went.

[37]Battle

   I've been fighting a war I can't win. Fighting a memory of something
   that used to be, oh, so sweet.
   To call this memory precious now would be a lie, as it only plagues me.
   It drags me down into the depths of confusion and despair.
   My focus is on getting angry, staying angry, hoping that my anger will
   burn all remnants of my thoughts, feelings, memories.
   So focused am I, that I'm suddenly unfocused. Blurred hindsight, bleary
   insight, no foresight.
   What am I really fighting for?
   "I will spend the rest of my life mourning someone who isn't dead. I
   will die considering my life unfulfilled due to a single moment."

[42]Untitled

   Her position was a strange one. When she thought about it, it was where
   she'd always been. She was popular, but somehow not. When she accepted
   an invitation others seemed glad to see her. But when she declined, she
   was not missed. It had always been that way. Co-workers, friends, even
   family. She'd resigned herself to this position, telling herself that
   it didn't matter. But in what had started as the smallest way, it
   mattered. And finally, it had come to matter very much.
   But something paralyzed her. She found it unthinkable to ask how she'd
   come to this position. Frankly, she didn't even know how to formulate
   the question, let alone who to ask.
   She felt an inexplicable emptiness and frequently took little social
   breaks, isolating as much as possible without causing alarm. Her
   closest friends began recognizing the breaks, welcoming her back with,
   "Been on intermission?" She was grateful for their acknowledgement,
   even if they didn't quite understand.
