   Name: Douglas Reed
   Age: 30
   Former occupation: Mechanic
   BACKSTORY
   From a young age it had always been Doug's responsibility to take care
   of his younger brother Scott. When his dad left him at four and his mom
   died at sixteen, the pressure was on. Doug and Scott were only four
   years apart, but Doug always had to be the father figure in the boy's
   life.
   Throughout the majority of his and his brother's life, they moved
   around. Doug got odd jobs here and there, but he and Scott never had a
   proper place to stay, no semblance of peace or normalcy.
   By the time Scott turned fourteen, they were able to settle down in
   Georgia. Scott started his fresh man year of high school and Doug got a
   job as a mechanic. It was good enough for the two brothers to get by.
   Scott graduated with flying colors and it wasn't a shock to Doug when
   he got a full scholarship to some fancy college up in Michigan. As much
   as he wanted to protest, he had to let his brother go and live his
   life.
   THE OUTBREAK
   For weeks there had been broadcasts talking about the new disease and
   city after city was being evacuated by the day. Soon chaos began
   flooding the streets.
   Doug paced back and forth angrily throughout his primarily empty
   apartment, phone in hand.
   "Dammit, Scotty! Answer the god damned phone!" He dialed his brother's
   number again, this time it went straight to voice mail.
   A loud knock on his door tore him from his worry driven stupor. He
   pulled open the door and took a step back, letting his brother step
   inside.
   "What the hell, Scotty! You almost gave me a god damn heart attack!"
   Doug yelled, relief and anger replacing the worry he felt.
   "Doug we gotta get out of here. You don't understand how bad it is out
   there." He pulled at his older brother's sleeve in an attempt to get
   him out the door.
   "And where do you expect us to go?" Doug questioned.
   His brother shook his head on a sigh, "I don't know, Doug. The news
   says head to the cities, but I think our best bet would be to head
   south. To the country side." He shrugged "Less people to worry about."
   And with that the two brothers were off and back on the road fending
   for themselves, much like their childhood.
