<p><span style="color:#000000;">Not long ago I watched the film <em>We Need to Talk About Kevin </em>(2011), a bleak tragedy starring Tilda Swindon as a mom who suspects that her adolescent son has some serious behavioral and mental issues. Her husband shrugs it off, thinking it’s just a phase he’ll grow out of. She watches with an increasingly helpless feeling as he becomes more and more dangerous, ultimately shooting up his high school, and killing most of his family, with a bow-and-arrow set. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">That’s how I’ve been feeling for much of the summer as I read CharismaNews.com every morning and scanned the comments. I understand that the magazine was once</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a style="color:#0000ff;" href="http://sarahbessey.com/afraid-letter-charismatic-brothers-sisters/?utm_content=buffer311e1&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">the flagship publication of the Charismatic / Pentecostal movement</a></span><span style="color:#000000;">, and that there are still</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> <a style="color:#0000ff;" href="http://t.co/acNUd1qeQs">many sincere, good-hearted people</a> </span><span style="color:#000000;">who work there. This is not a judgment on them. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">That being said, we need to address what <em>Charisma </em>is turning into. Something has gone dangerously awry inside the once-venerated institution. It is not healthy. It is not good. And, more and more, it is not safe. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">First, as I read, I saw that many of the articles were beginning to sport sensational headlines that prominently targeted a hated group or individual and offered them up as rage-bait for Christian viewers: </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“President Obama, You Have Crossed a Dangerous, Unprecedented Line.” </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Some Honest Questions for Professing ‘Gay Christians.’” </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Vicki Beeching and the Reason So Many ‘Christians’ are Coming Out as Gay.” </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“A Shameful Day in Christian Publishing” (accompanied by a picture of young Evangelical author</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a style="color:#0000ff;" href="http://rachelheldevans.com/blog/god-gay-christian-invitation?utm_content=buffer34042&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">Matt Vines</a></span>).</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Second, based on the comments section it became clear that the site was attracting a toxic demographic: people who were willing to believe any slander, embrace any accusation, as long as it was directed at someone they were predisposed to hate. I watched them arguing with non-believers and less extreme Christians (who were invariably labeled “trolls” and “atheists” and told they were going to hell because <em>the Bible says so</em>). They were immune to reason, immune to all appeals for compassion, immune to any scriptures that contradicted their preferred narrative of fear and demonization. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Terrifyingly, their endless diatribes against—you name it: gays, blacks, refugee children, pop stars, Christian entertainers, Democrats, evolutionists, filmmakers, conservative pastors—were routinely interspersed with the insistence that their venomous hate speech was “loving” and “holy.” <em>Love tells the truth. Love judges. Love hates what is evil</em>. Etc., etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">The following comment is typical:</span> <br /> <a href="https://thetalkingllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/plantation.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1180 size-medium aligncenter" src="https://thetalkingllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/plantation.jpg?w=300&#038;h=203" alt="Plantation" width="300" height="203" /></a><span style="color:#000000;">As is this one:<br /></span> <a href="https://thetalkingllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/scary-posts-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1181 size-full" src="http://thetalkingllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/scary-posts-1.jpg?w=640" alt="Scary Posts 1"   /></a><span style="color:#000000;"><br />And, with a few exceptions, it felt like the broader Christian community was unaware of the evils being promoted and perpetuated at Charisma. But two things happened last week to change that.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">First, the magazine ran an article with a shamelessly slanderous headline questioning the faith (and, by implication, the salvation) of Christian musician Michael Gungor. Gungor re-tweeted the headline, along with a plea for help:</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><br /></span> <a href="https://thetalkingllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/gungor.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1182 size-full" src="http://thetalkingllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/gungor.jpg?w=640" alt="Gungor"   /></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Following a public backlash, Charisma changed the headline (but kept the URL). Weirdly,</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a style="color:#0000ff;" href="http://www.donotlink.com/bk2r">the article itself</a> </span><span style="color:#000000;">barely mentions the divinity of Jesus.</p>
<p>And then on Friday—I don’t know how else to put this—it ran an article by</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a style="color:#0000ff;" href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2014/09/08/so-who-is-this-gary-cass-guy/">Gary Cass</a></span><span style="color:#000000;">, founder of the Christian Anti-Defamation Commission, </span><span style="color:#0000ff;"><a style="color:#0000ff;" href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:gQnz8-xV2L8J:www.charismanews.com/opinion/45300-why-i-am-absolutely-islamaphobic+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us"><span style="color:#000000;">calling for the</span> <em>sterilization, deportation, and killing of all Muslims</em></a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">If you haven’t actually read the article, that’s going to sound like the same sort of gratuitous hyperbole that Charisma traffics in. It is not hyperbole. Cass begins by laying out the arguments for enforced sterilization and deportation. But these measures will not work, because according to the Bible “Arab Muslims are God’s sworn enemies and are ordained by God to be against everyone.” Muslims, he goes on to say, can never be saved in large numbers. They are doomed in their billions to perdition.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And what’s worse, they’re creating a hell on earth for Christian believers <em>right now</em>. “ISIS is doing . . . what every true follower of Muhammad wants to do to you and yours—subjugate or murder you. They believe they have been given a mandate by Allah (Satan) to dominate the world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Which is why, in the end, only his last solution will be effective:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#000000;">“<strong>3. Violence.</strong> The only thing that is biblical and that 1,400 years of history has shown to work is overwhelming Christian just war and overwhelming self defense . . . This is not irrational, but the loving thing we must do for our children and neighbors. First trust in God, then obtain a gun(s), learn to shoot, teach your kids the Christian doctrines of just war and self defense, create small cells of family and friends that you can rely on if some thing catastrophic happens and civil society suddenly melts down . . .</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Militant Muslims cannot live in a society based on Christian ideals of equality and liberty. They will always seek to harm us. Now the only question is how many more dead bodies will have to pile up at home and abroad before we crush the vicious seed of Ishmael in Jesus’ Name?”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> Where to begin?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> I’ve been holding my own emotions in check for much of this post because I wanted to be careful. Anger in the pursuit of justice can so easily turn us into the monsters we fight against. But this is not the kind of article that calls for a cautious response. A mainstream Christian publication, a magazine that hundreds of thousands of Christians read and respect, published a call for the killing of over a billion people. It was not subtle. It’s not like you had to read between the lines to realize the full horror of what he was advocating—he came right out and said it. You’d have to be in massive denial</span> (<span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#0000ff;"><a style="color:#0000ff;text-decoration:underline;" href="https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&amp;disqus_version=f658bb91&amp;f=charismanews&amp;t_i=8ebe1c7940_id45300&amp;t_u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.charismanews.com%2Fopinion%2F45300-why-i-am-absolutely-islamaphobic&amp;t_d=%0A%09%09%09%09%09%09%09Why%20I%20Am%20Absolutely%20Islamaphobic%09%09%09%09%09%09&amp;t_t=%0A%09%09%09%09%09%09%09Why%20I%20Am%20Absolutely%20Islamaphobic%09%09%09%09%09%09&amp;s_o=popular&amp;l=">as so many were in the comments</a></span><span style="color:#000000;">) to not see that he was saying what he frankly and explicitly said.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And that scares me. Not just because my father was Muslim. But because, as an Irish-Pakistani-American with a bronze complexion, I don’t have <em>any </em>faith in the ability of Cass or his followers to distinguish between different groups of brown people.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Because, given his ignorance of the fact that</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a style="color:#0000ff;" href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/06/07/worlds-muslim-population-more-widespread-than-you-might-think/">only about 20 percent of the world’s Muslims are Arab</a></span><span style="color:#000000;">, I wouldn’t expect Cass to know the difference between a radical Islamist, a Sikh, a Hindu, and a Palestinian Christian.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Because it would not stop at Muslims. Because the commenters who lapped up that article, who overwhelmingly applauded Cass’s call to violent action against their Muslim neighbors</span>, <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a style="color:#0000ff;" href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2014/09/07/charismanews-com-goes-full-on-hutu-radio/">like the crowd that demanded the death of Jesus</a></span><span style="color:#000000;">, have already made clear that they have no tolerance for anyone who rejects their white fundamentalist culture and their extreme interpretation of Scripture. And a call for the death of all Muslims, printed on the front page of a widely-read Christian website, is a shot fired across the bow warning that none of the rest of us—Arabs and blacks, the university-educated, liberals, gays and lesbians, artists and entertainers, women, Catholics—are safe. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">But in a way, I’m grateful. Because even though the post was taken down following a massive public outcry on Sunday afternoon, the murderous spirit that was already operating at Charisma, even before last Friday, has been openly manifest. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I’ve written before on this blog</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a style="color:#0000ff;" href="http://thetalkingllama.wordpress.com/2014/06/30/12-years-a-slave-and-the-pyramid-of-hate/">about the pyramid of violence</a><span style="color:#000000;">.</span></span><span style="color:#000000;"> The thing we have to realize is that the mindsets that make genocide and other acts of violence possible are already in place <em>before </em>the call to violence is given. It begins on the lowest levels with name-calling, false accusations, slander, rumors, and verbal aggression. If you’re in a community where people are constantly shaming you, refusing to acknowledge your preferred identity (“You may think you’re gay, but we know better”), subjecting you to de-humanizing jokes and vicious insults, <em>and refusing to listen when you tell them to stop</em>, you are already in danger. You are being subjected to violence, even if no punches have yet been thrown. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And, as I’ve said before, if they’re <em>already </em>not listening when you tell them to stop verbally abusing you, if the Bible is already powerless to stop them, they will not listen when you’re insisting that you have a right not to be physically assaulted and murdered. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And that’s why Charisma is out of control, and that’s why it needs to be held to account. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Because “Why I am Absolutely Islamaphobic” was not an isolated column, but only the latest and most glaring manifestation of a much larger problem. “Malice eats it like a cancer,” in the words of Faramir, “and the cancer is growing.” </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Because if you go back and read the snippets from the comments that I posted earlier, and the hundreds of comments in response to Cass’s article, it’s clear that the site has become a beacon for bullies and extremists, for those <em>who don’t listen</em>, those who despise anything “different” or “weird” and would not be averse to using violence to be rid of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I realize that Internet comboxes are often cesspools of hatred and villainy. But until this weekend I’d never seen a commenter advocate the mass extermination of millions of people. The fact that this idea was first given voice by one of the site’s writers, in an article apparently read, reviewed, and printed with the editor&#8217;s stamp of approval, says everything you need to know about how dangerous Charisma has become.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Of all the tweets I read on Sunday, this is the one that probably best expresses what I’ve been feeling these last couple of days:</span><a href="https://thetalkingllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/natalie1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1194 aligncenter" src="http://thetalkingllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/natalie1.jpg?w=640" alt="Natalie"   /></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Reading the Gospels would be a start. In the meantime we can all pray that God will transform them through the light of the good news about Jesus.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">            — The Handsome Family, “Lake Geneva”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> My last year in high school was a strange time in my life. <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">It’s a year that I haven’t talked much about <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/06/the-seven-signs-youre-in-a-cult/361400/"><span style="color:#000000;">since I left the dangerous group</span></a> a few years ago because it’s hard to describe what happened without sounding a little insane. But I’ll try. <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Eric Booth had been my best friend for about three or four years. To the rest of our friends, we were an inseparable duo, one of the classic teams, like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Boze and Booth. We were always getting into trouble and wreaking havoc. <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And we were a great match. Booth was tall, outgoing, and good with women. I was quiet, bookish, a little awkward, and spent most of my time writing down entire conversations in a notebook I carried around everywhere. And while I was whimsical, romantic, and full of weird ideas, Booth was rational, pragmatic, and rigorously logical. (Once when a friend boasted that she was “one in a million,” Booth did the math and pointed out that there were at least 6,000 of her.) <br /></span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_1134" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://thetalkingllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/young-bobby.png"><img class="wp-image-1134 size-medium" src="http://thetalkingllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/young-bobby.png?w=300&#038;h=206" alt="Young Boze" width="300" height="206" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Me, my senior year of high school</p></div>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Booth and I had a teacher I’ll call Mr. McGowan. Mr. McGowan was our European History teacher, but he seemed to view himself as an entertainer first and teacher second. On the first day of my last year in Alvin in 2003, the day our story begins, he delivered a ten-minute monologue on the day’s news. “My Middle Eastern friend hasn’t been happy ever since we had that talk about Allah,” he said. “You know, Allah this, Allah that…” <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">(“Welcome to Mr. McGowan’s stand-up comedy class,” whispered Booth.) <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I’d been feeling sort of anxious about going back to school. So, to alleviate my concerns, Booth tried to think of the <strong>worst</strong> things that could possibly happen. “Watch, you’ll get put in the Criminal Law class!” he teased me. To our friend *Brandon he said, “Your counselors will mess up your schedule so bad, you won’t be able to fix it. And, you’ll get put in Child Development with all the pregnant chicks!” <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">So our whole first day back at school was interesting, because yes, I did get put in Criminal Law, even though I hadn’t signed up for it. When Brandon went to the counselor that afternoon to complain about his schedule, she tried to put him in Child Development. By the end of the day Booth had also correctly predicted that *Lauren, a girl I was interested in, would call me, even though she hadn’t done so in almost two years. <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">But we thought it was all just an incredibly weird string of coincidences—until the next day. <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">New England was experiencing a tremendous electrical shortage. The night before, over 45 million Americans had lost power in eight northeastern states. Mr. McGowan decided to begin his daily monologue by plugging the virtues of the Texas electrical system when compared to the infrastructures of New York and California (which was currently going through a recall election in which actor Arnold Schwarzenegger was the clear frontrunner).           <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“See, here we have a superior electrical system,” said Mr. McGowan, slowly warming up to his audience. “On the East coast, their facilities are sixty and seventy years old, and no one even knows how to fix ‘em anymore. Whenever a generator blows, they have to call out these really old men to take care of it. That’s why the New York electrical system <strong>sucks</strong>!” <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Booth leaned over and whispered, “Watch, the lights suddenly go out!” <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Oh, and Ah-nold!” said Mr. McGowan, shaking his head and grinning slightly. “Can you imagine? ‘Governor Schwarzenegger, we have a problem with immigration!’” He held up an imaginary gun. “<strong>‘I VILL TAKE CARE OF IT!’”</strong> <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">But at that moment the laughter of the class was interrupted by the lights going out. There’d been a power spike across the entire east side of Alvin and over a thousand homes had lost power. <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Booth denied it as best he could, but I could no longer doubt it: he was a prophet. Something strange and uncanny was happening in Alvin, and him and me and Brandon were about to be swept up in it. <br /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">*           *           *</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Brandon and I became convinced that tragedy was going to strike our campus. In the swirl and haze of late summer, omens were all around us. Thirteen ravens sitting on a power line, the mysterious imprint of a child’s hand on the window of a car, the continual recurrence of the number 42. One Sunday the <em>Houston Chronicle</em>’s daily Bible verse was Isaiah 13:13, in which God warns that judgment is about to fall on the land. <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">On the thirteenth day of school the three of us took a walk around campus during our last class, and we saw some strange things. Total strangers who looked just like people we knew (“Doppelgangers,” I explained to Brandon. “Omens of death”). Two ambulances flashing their sirens in the exact same place. (We fled when we heard a third one coming). <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">The whole day had a weird, uncanny quality about it. Booth and I spent most of the evening on the phone, speculating about what it all could mean. But then at about a quarter to nine, Brandon called and explained everything. The parents of a good friend of ours had just been caught up in a high-speed police chase. A man had rammed their car, and the three of them had been life-flighted to a hospital. <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Do you need me to spell it out for you, Boze?” said Brandon darkly. “We know two of the three people in that accident. Just like we <strong>saw </strong>three ambulances, but only heard the third one.” <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“We saw it,” I said quietly, my eyes brimming with sudden awareness. “We saw the whole thing.” <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Yes,” said Brandon. “And this is only the beginning. Whoever is behind this is trying to warn us of something. Something big that’s about to happen. Someone is going to die, unless we can stop it.” <br /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">*           *           *</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> The whole world had become a secret code begging to be deciphered by us. At first it was an exhilarating feeling, being privy to secrets that were hidden from the rest of our classmates and teachers. Mr. McGowan, the only person who seemed willing to listen, encouraged us to stay alert and pay attention to the numbers and patterns all around us.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> He urged me to keep journaling our encounters, but he also advised caution. “Your senses are keen and you’re making connections; you just may not be correct about them. That’s the strength of a novel: it’s <strong>fun</strong>.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> And it was, at first. But the longer it went on, the lonelier I felt. I was getting trapped in the maze of my own connections, and I wanted out, but there was no way back. Sometimes when I went into the cafeteria at lunch I would see four people I knew in succession, and the order in which I saw them would show me, with uncanny precision, how my relationships would unfold going into the next semester: which of my friends would suddenly betray me, which one would make an unexpected return to my life. And I was never wrong, and it was scary, in a way, because I felt sure I could see the future but I didn’t have anyone else except Brandon and Booth who believed me, and increasingly I felt isolated even from them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> And sometimes I wondered if I really <em>was </em>crazy, like that woman in the old song “who wrote poems to Jimmy Carter but forgot to feed her kids.” Though, as the first trimester of school wore on, a lot of strange things were happening and people were beginning to notice. Booth and our friend *Adriana had the same dream on the same night. I heard the exact words Brandon was thinking, as though he had said them aloud, as I lay on the floor half-asleep. Mr. McGowan’s wife saw an angel in their house. <br /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">*           *           *</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">In November I reconnected with *Blazes O’Reilly, a friend who had recently left Alvin to attend an advanced school for mathematics in north Texas. Blazes had been in love with Booth for a long time. (Those were his two major temptations, he had once told me: homosexuality and witchcraft). Before we’d been on the phone for more than a minute I asked if anything strange had happened to him lately.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Funny you should ask,” he said. He told me that since the middle of August demons had tried to possess him on ten different occasions. He would start cursing and throw his promise ring across the room. “It’s like Satan and the angels are fighting a war over my body,” he explained matter-of-factly.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“And what do you think it all means?” I asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Well, I was going to say, you’re going to think I’m crazy, but after the story you just told me, I’d be very surprised. I think we’re heading into a major spiritual battle, possibly the <strong>final </strong>battle, and both sides are gathering their key forces for a major offensive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Blazes O’Reilly seemed to think I had a major role to play in the final end-times battle. That was insane, crazy. I told no one what he had said to me on the phone that night, because my reputation had already suffered enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">A few weeks later, on a cool, sunny Saturday, Adriana came and sat down next to me at a UIL competition in San Antonio. She was a thin, quiet girl with short black hair and blue, sprightly eyes, and every time she watched the trailer for <em>The Return of the King</em> she wept, because it reminded her “of the great battle that is coming for us all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“What would you say if I told you that Jesus is going to return in our lifetime,” she asked me, “and that I will be one of his closest followers?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I was too polite to tell Adriana what I really thought, which is that it sounded like Satan was preparing her heart to receive the Antichrist.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">But apparently Adriana had similar feelings. Feeling encouraged by our conversation, she wrote me a letter that weekend. In it she revealed the horrible truth about her life. In dreams and visions God had shown her that she was soon going to meet the Antichrist. She would fall hopelessly in love with him, and the fall of men would begin.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“In a battle,” she wrote, “my love will be wounded and killed, though not by my hand, and he rises again. In the last battle, I am able to get past his defenses and, in the most horrifying moment of my life, kill the darkest love in the universe. And though I realize that I have saved my life and my fellow men, I know that my life will never be normal. I will never again feel the all-powerful passion of that love or the security of that touch. Though I know it was worth it, I can’t help but hate the loneliness that will accompany me for the rest of my life.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Can I deny this fate and give it to someone else? And if I do, will there be someone to answer my call? Am I the only one who can achieve this end? I need to talk to someone, but no one but you believes me.”<br /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">*           *           *</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">On the night I returned home from a long trip at the end of January, I called Booth and he filled me in on</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;"><span style="color:#000000;">what had happened in Alvin</span></span> <span style="color:#000000;">during the week I was gone. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Winter had taken over our high school. Friends were behaving differently, not like themselves at all. They were grumpy and depressed. They walked through the halls with scowls on their faces, barely lifting their heads to greet one another. Even the timid and pure were drinking, throwing wild parties, having sex. Booth had been invited to an orgy, but politely declined: he could see what the lure of sexual temptation was doing to the rest of his friends, and it scared him. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">But the biggest changes of all had taken place in Brandon. He had injured himself playing soccer and was no longer sure he would be able to attend the school of his dreams. His teammates had held him down and shaved his head. Now he was bald and wore a hood all the time like a Sith lord.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And he hated me. “I hate Boze,” he told Booth. “And you’re turning into him!” </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">For much of the first half of the school year Booth had been skeptical of our prophetic encounters and the battle that Adriana and I both felt was coming to our campus. But now he was beginning to reconsider. He told me how Brandon had yelled at a girl and threatened her with a baseball bat because she took a kitten that he wanted. He related how Mr. McGowan had snapped in the middle of class and started running through the room with a pair of scissors, screaming and laughing. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“I walk through the halls in the mornings,” said Booth, “and all I can see are faces of despair. I look into their eyes, and there is no hope. One by one, it’s overtaking everyone.” </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">It was after midnight. Booth told me to hang on for a second and put down the phone. When he returned a moment later, there was a note of worry in his voice. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“I don’t know what that was,” he said. “There was this thing, this noise… I think it was coming from under my bed…” </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And then, without any warning, he began yelling hysterically. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">He took the phone and ran from the room. From the safety of the kitchen, clutching a knife, he explained to me what had happened. There was a heavy breathing sound, and at first he thought it was the cat. But the cat was in the other room, and the noise was getting louder, and closer… </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">When Booth’s parents found him sleeping in the hall the next morning, they grounded him. But it didn’t matter. He knew what he had heard that night, and for the first time all year we were unequivocally on the same side. Too long had the darkness lingered. It was time to take back our campus. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">*           *           * </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Over the Christmas holidays Blazes O’Reilly had returned home and summoned a council. Though I had not mentioned to him the specifics of Adriana’s prophecy, I told him I felt they needed to become better acquainted, so the three of us gathered one wintry night in a back room of his parents’ house. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">The reception was not cordial. From the beginning of the meeting Adriana sensed a dark aura around Blazes, “the darkest I’ve ever seen.” At one point when he left the room to make tea, she confided, “My voices just told me not to trust him, because he’s been tempted”—an assertion that was seemingly affirmed a moment later when he returned and told her as much of his story as he had already told me. <em>How could she possibly have known that? </em>I wondered. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">For his part, Blazes swore he could see spirits of deception circling around Adriana. “There were three of them,” he explained with a casual air. “They were each taking turns whispering lies in her ear.” </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Oddly, though, Blazes couldn’t deny that he felt a strong sense of destiny about her. “I just have this feeling about her, like our fates are intertwined. Like we’re destined to fight to the death. Kind of like Lucifer and Gabriel, only I’m not sure which of us is which.” </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Adriana was sure, though. “My voices have shown me,” she said, “that Blazes is the Antichrist!” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">*           *           * </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">For my own part, God had revealed to me during the break that Lauren and I would be sexually tempted in the first week of March. Each of us who were called to be players in the end-time drama would be tempted by the end of the trimester. Whether we passed on to the next stage of our mission would depend on whether or not we passed the test. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">As if to confirm my suspicions, my first week back on campus I was propositioned by a sweet blonde girl with a twangy East Texas accent and her best friend in gym class. They wanted to know if I would have a threesome with them. I reached into my tote bag and pulled out a copy of the most recent edition of the school newspaper, in which I had written a long article about the importance of saving yourself for marriage. They read the article with expressions of deep fascination and thanked me. I implored Booth not to tell anyone else, but the whole school knew before lunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">As a result of some back-room finagling, I began giving a short message on the intercom every morning right after the Pledge of Allegiance. I urged the campus to pursue joy and beauty and resist the darkness that was seeking to devour. Together Booth and I wrote six pages in the next issue of the newspaper exclusively devoted to that subject. I negotiated with Mr. McGowan to let me teach European History for an entire week, and performed a spontaneous musical with Booth on the importance of enjoying life.<br /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">*           *           *</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">We waited for the first week of March, for the end of the second trimester.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I began having utterly terrifying dreams in which I seemed to be traveling out of my body at night and wandering through the rooms and halls of the trailer in which I lived. There were things in my bedroom I had never seen before. I heard footsteps in the hallway and saw strange lights outside my window.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I received my letter of acceptance from Southwestern University. I wondered if it was wise to go. I thought about staying in Alvin and fighting alongside my friends in the battle that was soon to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And then the trimester ended. We all settled into our new classes. And nothing happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">There was no battle, no moment of tempting. Lauren started dating a guy she had met two weeks before. And I could feel the ground giving way beneath my feet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">*           *           *</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">On a quiet and warm afternoon near the end of that week, Booth, Adriana, and I sat facing Mr. McGowan from across the desk in his classroom. We were all disconsolate and hoped he could give us answers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Adriana told the story of how she had nearly died the summer before, and how she began hearing the voices shortly after. Booth and I tried to explain all that had happened since Christmas, but it was clear from the moment we began talking that Mr. McGowan didn’t believe us. And by the time we related how Adriana learned that Blazes was the Antichrist, and how Blazes himself seemed to think that he was, and how we had briefly debated using physical force to try and subdue him, small beads of sweat were breaking out on the sides of his round face.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I watched him imploringly. I just wanted someone to explain what was going on. My prophetic gift had never been wrong before. Why had it failed me now, at the most critical time?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“First of all,” he said, in a very low and quiet voice, “what you’re going through is not unusual.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I’m not sure what I had been expecting, but it wasn’t this. “Are you serious?” I asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">He nodded. “For one, the three of you are reading from a shared text. Whenever three or four people read from a shared text, it’s not hard to induce shared delusions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Second, I think you’re scared. You’re scared because you’re about to graduate, Boze, and you two will be graduating in about a year. And you’re leaving the only home you’ve ever known, and that’s an incredibly traumatic experience. And it’s not uncommon for students who are juniors and seniors in high school to start having apocalyptic visions, because it’s their way of expressing kind of the terror they feel at the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Because, let’s face it, the world may not be ending, but the only world <em>you’ve </em>ever known is ending. You know how they say, ‘You can’t go home again.’ You may come back in a few years, but the school that you knew will be gone. Reality won’t live up to your memories. When you go away to college, you’ll forget about me. And when you think about me at all, you’ll think of me as some sophomoric teacher who liked to pretend he knew everything. But I don’t. And some day you’ll realize that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">My entire experience of the last eight months, all I had felt and foreseen and suffered, was slipping away. The apocalypse wasn’t going to happen, it might never happen, or else it had been postponed. But I was determined to hold on.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“What about all the others?” I asked. “We’re not the only ones. What about Blazes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Mr. McGowan shook his head. “There’s something very dark and unnatural about that man,” he said. “He went wrong somewhere… became something different than what God intended.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">He stood up summarily from his desk, as though to suggest that the meeting was over. Together the four of us walked to the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Booth turned in the doorway and faced him.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“I do have a question,” he said. “Was it you? Were you the one who orchestrated… you know, all of that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Mr. McGowan stared at him quizzically. “No,” he said with finality.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">We waited. I looked at him, more confused than ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Do you mean, was I pandering and manipulating you?” He laughed lightly. “Oh, of course.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">He clapped us both hard on the shoulders. “It was quite fun, actually. I’m honestly kind of sad it took y’all that long to figure it out. Your senses were picking up on stuff, but I was putting a spin on it. It’s good that you wanted an order to life, but you have to want it in order to see it. That’s why the super-sensible is so hard for empiricists to get.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">He closed the door behind us. Adriana and Booth and I walked forward into the harsh sunlight.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">*           *           *</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">It’s been ten years since that conversation in Mr. McGowan’s room, but the course my life has taken since graduation has been in a lot of ways a vindication of his warnings. Sociologists tell us that conspiracy theories and apocalyptic thinking are deeply intertwined, and that wherever you find one, you’re likely to find the other. It’s a pathology in the American psyche, a sickness, this fascination with the end times. There’s something deeply un-Christian about it. It’s as though Jesus and the Bible have become nothing more than cultural totems with the power to drive us mad.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I’ve held on to my faith, but just barely. The realization that I was not a prophet was devastating, but what has been much worse is seeing the damage caused by End-Times fanaticism, the toll that it takes. I’ve seen it drive otherwise sane people to the brink of madness. I’ve watched it transform them until they were no longer recognizable, until they were willing to do the most horrible things to even their closest friends. I’ve seen it <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/06/the-seven-signs-youre-in-a-cult/361400/"><span style="color:#0000ff;">claim the life</span></a></span> of one of my dearest friends in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">So I find myself thinking about the events of that year, and the great disappointment of third trimester, and Mr. McGowan’s explanation for what had happened to us. I think about it whenever a good Christian whom I respect is incredulous that I’m not prepping for the end times, as though it makes me some lesser species of Christian that I don’t have an opinion about when Jesus is coming back. I think about it when I’m sitting on the shuttle next to a man who wrote a 200-page book about the role of the nephilim in the last days that he’s trying to sell me,</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a href="http://thetalkingllama.wordpress.com/2014/02/24/the-scariest-thing-about-my-abuser/"><span style="color:#0000ff;">when I’m in a meeting with Christian counselors</span></a></span> <span style="color:#000000;">who are demanding that I pray out loud to accept my calling to battle the forces of the Antichrist. I think about it whenever someone on Facebook tells me</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bobby.herrington.1/posts/706016046407"><span style="color:#0000ff;">they can’t wait to be martyred</span></a></span><span style="color:#000000;">, that they hope they continue to laugh long after their head has been severed from their body.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Boze, where do you <strong>find </strong>these people?” Bethany once asked me, the first time I recounted my story—back when the dangerous group was just forming.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And sometimes I listen to that song, “<span style="color:#0000ff;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjVB8zM-xuQ"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Lake Geneva</span></a></span>,” by The Handsome Family, about a woman whose husband is hospitalized because he sees visions of the heavens in the stumps of falling trees:</span></p>
<blockquote><p> </p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“You remember how he cried</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">When they strapped him to the stretcher</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Convinced his arms were burning</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">With electricity from heaven</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“You remember how he told you</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Black holes were like Jesus</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And the crucifix was a battery</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">That filled the air with fire”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And I hear that and I think, isn’t that my story, and the story of our country? That we’d rather read about</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Harbinger-Ancient-Mystery-Americas/dp/161638610X"><span style="color:#0000ff;">the mysterious code</span></a></span> <span style="color:#000000;">that foretells the day of judgment than lift a finger to help the teeming masses on whose treatment the nations will be judged? And aren’t we a sick society, when conspiracy theories and end-times mania, the province of the young and confused and deranged and scared, are mistaken for true worship?<br /></span></p>

<p>A<span style="color:#000000;">fter my last conversation with Mr. McGowan, I accepted the nature of the fantasy I had been living in. I was no prophet. I wasn’t destined for greatness. The only certain thing in my life at that moment was graduation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And instead of running away from it, as I had been doing all year, I learned to accept it. I embraced my own normalcy, and in doing so I found freedom and a certain measure of happiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And at the end of May I graduated and left high school behind me. I worry that some of us are there still.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"></p>

		<p><a href="https://thetalkingllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/if-youre-feeling-sinister-belle-sebastian.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1163" src="http://thetalkingllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/if-youre-feeling-sinister-belle-sebastian.jpeg?w=300&#038;h=300" alt="if-youre-feeling-sinister-belle-sebastian" width="300" height="300" /></a><span style="color:#000000;">In 1995, Stuart Murdoch’s life did not seem to be moving anywhere fast. The twenty-seven-year old Scotsman had been suffering for upwards of six years from the effects of myalgic encephalomyelitis, better known as chronic fatigue syndrome. Because his condition made even playing on the piano an exhausting endeavor, he was unable to find work. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Living in Glasgow on public assistance, Murdoch joined “beat box,” a government program for the unemployed. He would later compare it to a “refugee camp for unemployed musicians.” The unemployed took a music training course and played music together. Once a month they were given access to a recording studio. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">It was here that Murdoch first connected with the people who would form Belle &amp; Sebastian; and it was here in the summer of 1996 that they recorded what are now widely regarded as two of the best albums of the 1990s, <em>Tigermilk </em>and <em>If You’re Feeling Sinister</em>. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Though the beloved indie band has covered a range of genres in their nearly twenty-year career, from folk to shoegaze to chamber pop, and has stylistically referenced bands as disparate as The Left Banke and The Smiths, the elegiac wistfulness of <em>If You’re Feeling Sinister </em>has become their defining sound. Even after they gained renewed critical acclaim and an unprecedented level of public attention with <em>The Life Pursuit </em>(2006), a collection of irresistibly danceable power-pop anthems, critics and long-time fans rightly pointed to their earliest work as their magnum opus.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Writing and recording twenty songs in the space of a few weeks would be a career-worthy accomplishment for any band. But Belle &amp; Sebastian went a step further, crafting songs that seem to have been whispered out of the ether, songs that don’t so much seem to have been written as captured. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Take, for example, the Satie-like simplicity of “Fox in the Snow.” With piano, guitar, violin, and vibraphone, the band conjures up a serenely autumnal world in which soft-hearted youth have fallen on hard times. For me the special gift of Belle &amp; Sebastian, my all-time favorite band, has always been its ability to evoke the rhythms and changes of the seasons, using lyrics and music to engage the senses so fully that it really feels as though the listener is standing on a wintry street corner in Edinburgh.</span></p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/bKSI1idOUzM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Fox in the snow</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Where do you go</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><em>To find something you can eat?</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Cause the word out on the street is</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><em>You are starving<br />
</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">If the lyrics are precious, they’re also devastatingly effective, compressing whole years of hope and despair and angst into the space of a few verses. “Fox in the Snow” showcases what would become one of Belle &amp; Sebastian’s hallmarks, their knack for writing realistic, sharply observed character sketches about people who are young and lost and very much in over their heads. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Just prior to the recording of <em>If You’re Feeling Sinister</em>,</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a href="http://christandpopculture.com/ready-every-song-i-ever-wrote-was-written-for-you-belle-and-sebastian/"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Stuart had moved into a bachelor flat above a church</span></a></span><span style="color:#000000;">. There he worked in the parish hall and sang in the choir in between writing songs for the album. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“I always wanted to write about normal people doing normal things,” he recalls</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/49599-pitchforktv-presents-a-documentary-on-belle-and-sebastians-if-youre-feeling-sinister/"><span style="color:#0000ff;">in a Pitchfork documentary about the making of the album</span></a></span>. <span style="color:#000000;">“Because I wasn’t normal, I was out of the game. It was very attractive to me what normal people were doing.” So he set out to write songs about the “normal” folks he ran into in the streets and on the buses of Glasgow, though his own sly perceptiveness was always winking through, creating vividly eccentric figures who are instantly recognizable and yet somehow bigger than life: a track star who was driven to fame by the lure of getting to wear terry underwear; Hilary, who’s into S &amp; M and Bible studies; Judy, who walks the streets dreaming of horses. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Of the ten songs on this album, the penultimate song, “Boy Done Wrong Again,” is the weakest, a slow sleeper that saps much of the energy from an otherwise rollicking back half. Like <em>Tigermilk </em>before it, the album begins in minimalistic fashion, with only the quiet plucking of strings to accompany Murdoch’s voice. But as “Stars of Track and Field” progresses, the rest of the band gradually joins in, adding new instrumentation (organ, trumpets) layer upon layer, building slowly and progressively to a powerful conclusion that promises good things to come. “Seeing Other People” is a near-perfect evocation of early morning and the ambivalence of two people trying to let go of each other but not being able to. “Me and the Major” explores the unbridgeable gaps between classes and generations with lyrics that are both spirited and resentful: “We’re the younger generation / We grew up fast / All the others did drugs / They’re taking it out on us.” </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">In terms of pure atmosphere, the next two songs are probably the album’s high point. “Like Dylan in the Movies” recalls Murdoch’s experience of having to walk through Kelvingrove Park, a shady Glasgow park. The combination of guitar, strings, and xylophone powerfully evokes a sense of the year ending, of autumn, and twilight. “Dylan” is followed by the wintry and underrated “Fox in the Snow.” The placement of these two songs on the album, and their musical kinship, seem to suggest that one is a continuation of the other. It’s worth listening to the two back to back. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Get Me Away From Here, I’m Dying” is a light rocker about a naïve young man. Musically it’s as good as anything on the album, but the lyrics are achingly, almost embarrassingly sentimental. “I always cry at endings,” Murdoch sings, and then, as if already regretting this exercise in vulnerability, adds in the next verse, “Oh, that wasn’t what I meant to say at all.” </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">However, the shortcomings of this song are more than offset by the eerie brilliance of the one following. <em>If You’re Feeling Sinister’s </em>title track is also the album’s standout, with a backing track of children playing and enigmatic lyrics that have been variously explained as a satire of organized religion and the final thoughts of two people preparing to kill themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/8Yznz_oncrI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Finally, “Mayfly” is a jangly guitar ballad in the style of The Byrds, while “Judy and the Dream of Horses” closes the album in high spirits with an almost pure distillation of pop craftsmanship.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Not satisfied with the production quality of the original recording, Belle &amp; Sebastian recorded a live performance in 2005 for All Tomorrow’s Parties. It’s worth hearing just to assess the differences between the two recordings—in 1995, the band was young and unproven, while in 2005 it was one of the most successful indie rock bands in the world. But the original is the reason for their breakout success, and it remains the better version of their best album.</span></p>

		<p><a href="https://thetalkingllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/xander-zeppo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1157" src="http://thetalkingllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/xander-zeppo.jpg?w=640" alt="Xander zeppo"   /></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">One of the best episodes of <em>Buffy </em>shows Xander having his own crazy adventure while in the background the other Scoobies battle to save the world from being destroyed by a hideous monster. We catch glimpses of their battle throughout the episode. They’re all crying and yelling at each other. At the end Buffy tells Giles he did one of the bravest things she had ever seen (but we never learn what he did).</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">It reminded me very much of the weekend in 2007 when <a title="The Bethany Deaton Case: A Blogging and News Roundup" href="http://thetalkingllama.wordpress.com/2014/06/20/the-bethany-deaton-case-a-blogging-and-news-roundup/"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">our cult</span></span></a> had to unite and battle the demonic spirit that was over Southwestern: all the feelings that come to the surface when you’re fighting an enemy that only a few people are able to see.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And then I got to thinking about… something I thought a lot about in the aftermath of that weekend: the scary things I used to see in my bedroom that weren’t normally there. <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a title="“The Apocalypse Has Been Postponed Until Gym”: My Last Year of High School &amp; the End of the World, Part 2" href="http://thetalkingllama.wordpress.com/2014/07/23/the-apocalypse-has-been-postponed-until-gym-my-last-year-of-high-school-the-end-of-the-world-part-2/"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Traveling out of my body</span></a></span> was an experience very much like that of Frodo when he put on the Ring. He went into another realm and could see things no one else could. And basically, when the group started, we were all doing that.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And then I read a story about how Rwanda’s Christians are</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/07/24/the_woman_who_came_back_from_hell"><span style="color:#0000ff;">coping with the aftermath of genocide</span></a></span><span style="color:#000000;"> by turning to Pentecostalism. It provides them a framework for understanding the supernatural evil that was unleashed on their country in 1994. This article in <em>Foreign Policy </em>magazine tells the story of a young woman named Rebecca whose family was offered sanctuary in a Catholic church. It turned out to be a trap, and her parents were killed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And then this happened:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">Two years later, having found a home with a foster family, Rebecca made friends with a girl of her own age named Alice. One day, Alice led her into a cemetery, and there, as Rebecca tells it, the ground opened up, revealing a flight of stairs that led down into the realm of Satan. “It was a place where there was always twilight,” says Rebecca. “It was a world of bad spirits. They put an evil spirit into my body and then they sent it back out into the world.” For the next five years, she says, her body wandered the land, causing ill wherever it could. “I had the power of causing accidents on Earth. The demons gave me that power.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;">It took her five years to fight her way back. She suffered terribly, she says. But one day she encountered a group of Pentecostal Christians who prayed for her release from the powers that plagued her. With their help she finally found release, and “accepted Jesus as my king.” At age 17, she converted from her ancestral Catholicism to the Pentecostal Church, a move that finally brought her “inner peace.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">So when I think about The Children, and invisible realms that are super-imposed on this one, and mysterious invisible objects, and the Air Loom Gang, and my own made-up kingdom of Elsia, I can see a mythology emerging. Inevitably, I think the story will have to be about four or five kids who have, or think they have, unusual powers, and who are at war with unseen forces that no one else sees. And they belong to a society of people who have these gifts. And this society believes the end of the world is imminent. And it provides a place for the kids to learn and grow up and fall in love when they’re not saving the world. And the world itself seems to be going to pieces around them, with living houses and nightmare clouds and whatnot, strange disturbances in nature. And as the series goes on they begin to question the nature of their mission, especially as friends die and the “enemy” becomes not just invisible creatures but real people. And they begin to wonder whether they really are doing the right thing, and whether they’ve been misled, and whether the world is really ending.</span></p>

		<p><span class="userContent"><a href="https://thetalkingllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/12-years-a-slave-lynching-scene-02-720x300.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1153" src="http://thetalkingllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/12-years-a-slave-lynching-scene-02-720x300.jpg?w=640&#038;h=266" alt="12-Years-a-Slave-Lynching-Scene-02-720x300" width="640" height="266" /></a>On April 23, 1899, a man named Sam Hose was stabbed, burned alive, and cut to pieces.</p>
<p>Sam was a black farmhand from Georgia who was suspected of murdering his master. On the run from the law, he fled across country, was captured and taken <span class="text_exposed_show">into custody. But as he was being transported by train to Atlanta, word leaked out that the infamous fugitive had been arrested and was going to be lynched.</p>
<p>Hose was hauled off the train at gunpoint and taken to a nearby farm in a small town while a crowd gathered round him. Some estimates place the size of the crowd at over 2,000 people. The news sparked a mad rush of worshipers from churches in Atlanta, where Sunday services were just ending. Demand to see the lynching was so great that the railroad company arranged several unscheduled runs, while those who were unable to buy tickets climbed in through the windows and clung to the sides of the trains.</p>
<p>Sam Hose was chained to a pine tree. His ears and fingers were cut off, and as the crowd cheered, he was stabbed and set on fire, dowsed with kerosene they had been given by a local vendor at no cost. He tried to pull himself out of the fire with his fingerless hands, but was pushed back in.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, he died. His last words were, &#8220;Oh my God. Oh, Jesus.&#8221;</p>
<p>What remained of his body was cut into pieces and passed among the crowd as souvenirs, like a twisted form of communion. His knuckles were placed on display in the window of a grocery store in Atlanta.</p>
<p><a href="https://thetalkingllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/sam-hose-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1154" src="http://thetalkingllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/sam-hose-1.jpg?w=640" alt="sam-hose-1"   /></a>Sam was one of 27 people lynched that year.</p>
<p>This is why I can&#8217;t understand when people say America is more wicked than it&#8217;s ever been, when they long for the glory days of our Christian past. Sam Hose was murdered by the honest, God-fearing folk of Atlanta. Sam Hose was burned into cinders by a crowd on its way home from church. And when I think about the rhetoric used in our churches to demonize outsiders, when I think about how so many believers are gearing up for what they believe is an apocalyptic war between the forces of good and evil led by a vengeful, slaughtering messiah, I can no longer accept the lie that a true Christian would never be swayed by a mob, that we could never find ourselves fighting on the wrong side in the conflict of right and wrong.</p>
<p>Some people say, &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to see how conditions in America could ever get so bad that Christians would be willing to murder.&#8221; But the truth is, it already happened. And it happened for a long time.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">On the night I returned home from a long trip at the end of January, I called Booth and he filled me in on</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a title="“The Apocalypse Has Been Postponed Until Gym”: My Last Year of High School &amp; the End of the World, Part I" href="http://thetalkingllama.wordpress.com/2014/07/22/the-apocalypse-has-been-postponed-until-gym-my-last-year-of-high-school-the-end-of-the-world-part-i/"><span style="color:#0000ff;">what had happened in Alvin</span></a></span> <span style="color:#000000;">during the week I was gone. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Winter had taken over our high school. Friends were behaving differently, not like themselves at all. They were grumpy and depressed. They walked through the halls with scowls on their faces, barely lifting their heads to greet one another. Even the timid and pure were drinking, throwing wild parties, having sex. Booth had been invited to an orgy, but politely declined: he could see what the lure of sexual temptation was doing to the rest of his friends, and it scared him. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">But the biggest changes of all had taken place in Brandon. He had injured himself playing soccer and was no longer sure he would be able to attend the school of his dreams. His teammates had held him down and shaved his head. Now he was bald and wore a hood all the time like a Sith lord.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And he hated me. “I hate Boze,” he told Booth. “And you’re turning into him!” </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">For much of the first half of the school year Booth had been skeptical of our prophetic encounters and the battle that Adriana and I both felt was coming to our campus. But now he was beginning to reconsider. He told me how Brandon had yelled at a girl and threatened her with a baseball bat because she took a kitten that he wanted. He related how Mr. McGowan had snapped in the middle of class and started running through the room with a pair of scissors, screaming and laughing. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“I walk through the halls in the mornings,” said Booth, “and all I can see are faces of despair. I look into their eyes, and there is no hope. One by one, it’s overtaking everyone.” </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">It was after midnight. Booth told me to hang on for a second and put down the phone. When he returned a moment later, there was a note of worry in his voice. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“I don’t know what that was,” he said. “There was this thing, this noise… I think it was coming from under my bed…” </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And then, without any warning, he began yelling hysterically. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">He took the phone and ran from the room. From the safety of the kitchen, clutching a knife, he explained to me what had happened. There was a heavy breathing sound, and at first he thought it was the cat. But the cat was in the other room, and the noise was getting louder, and closer… </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">When Booth’s parents found him sleeping in the hall the next morning, they grounded him. But it didn’t matter. He knew what he had heard that night, and for the first time all year we were unequivocally on the same side. Too long had the darkness lingered. It was time to take back our campus. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">*           *           * </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Over the Christmas holidays Blazes O’Reilly had returned home and summoned a council. Though I had not mentioned to him the specifics of Adriana’s prophecy, I told him I felt they needed to become better acquainted, so the three of us gathered one wintry night in a back room of his parents’ house. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">The reception was not cordial. From the beginning of the meeting Adriana sensed a dark aura around Blazes, “the darkest I’ve ever seen.” At one point when he left the room to make tea, she confided, “My voices just told me not to trust him, because he’s been tempted”—an assertion that was seemingly affirmed a moment later when he returned and told her as much of his story as he had already told me. <em>How could she possibly have known that? </em>I wondered. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">For his part, Blazes swore he could see spirits of deception circling around Adriana. “There were three of them,” he explained with a casual air. “They were each taking turns whispering lies in her ear.” </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Oddly, though, Blazes couldn’t deny that he felt a strong sense of destiny about her. “I just have this feeling about her, like our fates are intertwined. Like we’re destined to fight to the death. Kind of like Lucifer and Gabriel, only I’m not sure which of us is which.” </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Adriana was sure, though. “My voices have shown me,” she said, “that Blazes is the Antichrist!” </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">*           *           * </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">For my own part, God had revealed to me during the break that Lauren and I would be sexually tempted in the first week of March. Each of us who were called to be players in the end-time drama would be tempted by the end of the trimester. Whether we passed on to the next stage of our mission would depend on whether or not we passed the test. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">As if to confirm my suspicions, my first week back on campus I was propositioned by a sweet blonde girl with a twangy East Texas accent and her best friend in gym class. They wanted to know if I would have a threesome with them. I reached into my tote bag and pulled out a copy of the most recent edition of the school newspaper, in which I had written a long article about the importance of saving yourself for marriage. They read the article with expressions of deep fascination and thanked me. I implored Booth not to tell anyone else, but the whole school knew before lunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">As a result of some back-room finagling, I began giving a short message on the intercom every morning right after the Pledge of Allegiance. I urged the campus to pursue joy and beauty and resist the darkness that was seeking to devour. Together Booth and I wrote six pages in the next issue of the newspaper exclusively devoted to that subject. Booth even penned an article about the “Economics of Joy” in which he graphed the school’s GDP: “Good Deeds Potential”:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> <a href="https://thetalkingllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/gdp.png"><span style="color:#000000;"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1145 size-medium" src="http://thetalkingllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/gdp.png?w=300&#038;h=168" alt="GDP" width="300" height="168" /></span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I negotiated with Mr. McGowan to let me teach European History for an entire week. On Friday I announced that I had brought in a motivational speaker, Mr. “Ebenezer Scrooge” of Scrooge &amp; Marley’s. The entire class groaned as Booth strode up to the front of the room. Then, as if out of nowhere, music began playing. Scrooge and I spontaneously broke into a dance and were joined by a guy in the third row who knew all the lyrics to the original song (from the 1970 <em>Scrooge </em>musical). For four and a half minutes we twirled around the room and sang about the pleasures of enjoying life:</span></p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/KpTxBuo8zno?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Where there’s music and laughter</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Happiness is rife!</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Why?</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Because I like life!<br />
</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">The entire class watched with mounting incredulity, and by the end of the song Lauren was in tears. “That was the most bizarre thing I’ve ever seen,” she said sadly. Booth and I sat quietly back down as though nothing had happened.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">*           *           *</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">We waited for the first week of March, for the end of the second trimester.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I began having utterly terrifying dreams in which I seemed to be traveling out of my body at night and wandering through the rooms and halls of the trailer in which I lived. There were things in my bedroom I had never seen before. I heard footsteps in the hallway and saw strange lights outside my window.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I received my letter of acceptance from Southwestern University. I wondered if it was wise to go. I thought about staying in Alvin and fighting alongside my friends in the battle that was soon to come.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And then the trimester ended. We all settled into our new classes. And nothing happened.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">There was no battle, no moment of tempting. Lauren started dating a guy she had met two weeks before. And I could feel the ground giving way beneath my feet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">*           *           *</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">On a quiet and warm afternoon near the end of that week, Booth, Adriana, and I sat facing Mr. McGowan from across the desk in his classroom. We were all disconsolate and hoped he could give us answers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Adriana told the story of how she had nearly died the summer before, and how she began hearing the voices shortly after. Booth and I tried to explain all that had happened since Christmas, but it was clear from the moment we began talking that Mr. McGowan didn’t believe us. And by the time we related how Adriana learned that Blazes was the Antichrist, and how Blazes himself seemed to think that he was, and how we had briefly debated using physical force to try and subdue him, small beads of sweat were breaking out on the sides of his round face.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I watched him imploringly. I just wanted someone to explain what was going on. My prophetic gift had never been wrong before. Why had it failed me now, at the most critical time?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“First of all,” he said, in a very low and quiet voice, “what you’re going through is not unusual.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I’m not sure what I had been expecting, but it wasn’t this. “Are you serious?” I asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">He nodded. “For one, the three of you are reading from a shared text. Whenever three or four people read from a shared text, it’s not hard to induce shared delusions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Second, I think you’re scared. You’re scared because you’re about to graduate, Boze, and you two will be graduating in about a year. And you’re leaving the only home you’ve ever known, and that’s an incredibly traumatic experience. And it’s not uncommon for students who are juniors and seniors in high school to start having apocalyptic visions, because it’s their way of expressing kind of the terror they feel at the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Because, let’s face it, the world may not be ending, but the only world <em>you’ve </em>ever known is ending. You know how they say, ‘You can’t go home again.’ You may come back in a few years, but the school that you knew will be gone. Reality won’t live up to your memories. When you go away to college, you’ll forget about me. And when you think about me at all, you’ll think of me as some sophomoric teacher who liked to pretend he knew everything. But I don’t. And some day you’ll realize that.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">My entire experience of the last eight months, all I had felt and foreseen and suffered, was slipping away. The apocalypse wasn’t going to happen, it might never happen, or else it had been postponed. But I was determined to hold on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“What about all the others?” I asked. “We’re not the only ones. What about Blazes?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Mr. McGowan shook his head. “There’s something very dark and unnatural about that man,” he said. “He went wrong somewhere… became something different than what God intended.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">He stood up summarily from his desk, as though to suggest that the meeting was over. Together the four of us walked to the door.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Booth turned in the doorway and faced him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“I do have a question,” he said. “Was it you? Were you the one who orchestrated… you know, all of that?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Mr. McGowan stared at him quizzically. “No,” he said with finality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">We waited. I looked at him, more confused than ever.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Do you mean, was I pandering and manipulating you?” He laughed lightly. “Oh, of course.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">He clapped us both hard on the shoulders. “It was quite fun, actually. I’m honestly kind of sad it took y’all that long to figure it out. Your senses were picking up on stuff, but I was putting a spin on it. It’s good that you wanted an order to life, but you have to want it in order to see it. That’s why the super-sensible is so hard for empiricists to get.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">He closed the door behind us. Adriana and Booth and I walked forward into the harsh sunlight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">*           *           *</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">It’s been ten years since that conversation in Mr. McGowan’s room, but the course my life has taken since graduation has been in a lot of ways a vindication of his warnings. Sociologists tell us that conspiracy theories and apocalyptic thinking are deeply intertwined, and that wherever you find one, you’re likely to find the other. It’s a pathology in the American psyche, a sickness, this fascination with the end times. There’s something deeply un-Christian about it. It’s as though Jesus and the Bible have become nothing more than cultural totems with the power to drive us mad.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I’ve held on to my faith, but just barely. The realization that I was not a prophet was devastating, but what has been much worse is seeing the damage caused by End-Times fanaticism, the toll that it takes. I’ve seen it drive otherwise sane people to the brink of madness. I’ve watched it transform them until they were no longer recognizable, until they were willing to do the most horrible things to even their closest friends. I’ve seen it <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/06/the-seven-signs-youre-in-a-cult/361400/"><span style="color:#0000ff;">claim the life</span></a></span> of one of my dearest friends in the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">So I find myself thinking about the events of that year, and the great disappointment of third trimester, and Mr. McGowan’s explanation for what had happened to us. I think about it whenever a good Christian whom I respect is incredulous that I’m not prepping for the end times, as though it makes me some lesser species of Christian that I don’t have an opinion about when Jesus is coming back. I think about it when I’m sitting on the shuttle next to a man who wrote a 200-page book about the role of the nephilim in the last days that he’s trying to sell me,</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a href="http://thetalkingllama.wordpress.com/2014/02/24/the-scariest-thing-about-my-abuser/"><span style="color:#0000ff;">when I’m in a meeting with Christian counselors</span></a></span> <span style="color:#000000;">who are demanding that I pray out loud to accept my calling to battle the forces of the Antichrist. I think about it whenever someone on Facebook tells me</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bobby.herrington.1/posts/706016046407"><span style="color:#0000ff;">they can’t wait to be martyred</span></a></span><span style="color:#000000;">, that they hope they continue to laugh long after their head has been severed from their body.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Boze, where do you <strong>find </strong>these people?” Bethany once asked me, the first time I recounted my story—back when the dangerous group was just forming.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And sometimes I listen to that song, “<span style="color:#0000ff;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjVB8zM-xuQ"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Lake Geneva</span></a></span>,” by The Handsome Family, about a woman whose husband is hospitalized because he sees visions of the heavens in the stumps of falling trees:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“You remember how he cried</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">When they strapped him to the stretcher</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Convinced his arms were burning</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">With electricity from heaven</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“You remember how he told you</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Black holes were like Jesus</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And the crucifix was a battery</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">That filled the air with fire”</span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And I hear that and I think, isn’t that my story, and the story of our country? That we’d rather read about</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Harbinger-Ancient-Mystery-Americas/dp/161638610X"><span style="color:#0000ff;">the mysterious code</span></a></span> <span style="color:#000000;">that foretells the day of judgment than lift a finger to help the teeming masses on whose treatment the nations will be judged? And aren’t we a sick society, when conspiracy theories and end-times mania, the province of the young and confused and deranged and scared, are mistaken for true worship?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">After my last conversation with Mr. McGowan, I accepted the nature of the fantasy I had been living in. I was no prophet. I wasn’t destined for greatness. The only certain thing in my life at that moment was graduation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And instead of running away from it, as I had been doing all year, I learned to accept it. I embraced my own normalcy, and in doing so I found freedom and a certain measure of happiness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And at the end of May I graduated and left high school behind me. I worry that some of us are there still.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><em>To comfort an old woman</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Or see visions of the heavens</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><em>In the stumps of fallen trees?”</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">            — The Handsome Family, “Lake Geneva”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> My last year in high school was a strange time in my life.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">It’s a year that I haven’t talked much about <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/06/the-seven-signs-youre-in-a-cult/361400/"><span style="color:#000000;">since I left the dangerous group</span></a> a few years ago because it’s hard to describe what happened without sounding a little insane. But I’ll try.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Eric Booth had been my best friend for about three or four years. To the rest of our friends, we were an inseparable duo, one of the classic teams, like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Boze and Booth. We were always getting into trouble and wreaking havoc.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And we were a great match. Booth was tall, outgoing, and good with women. I was quiet, bookish, a little awkward, and spent most of my time writing down entire conversations in a notebook I carried around everywhere. And while I was whimsical, romantic, and full of weird ideas, Booth was rational, pragmatic, and rigorously logical. (Once when a friend boasted that she was “one in a million,” Booth did the math and pointed out that there were at least 6,000 of her.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<div id="attachment_1134" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://thetalkingllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/young-bobby.png"><img class="wp-image-1134 size-medium" src="http://thetalkingllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/young-bobby.png?w=300&#038;h=206" alt="Young Boze" width="300" height="206" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Me, my senior year of high school</p></div>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Booth and I had a teacher I’ll call Mr. McGowan. Mr. McGowan was our European History teacher, but he seemed to view himself as an entertainer first and teacher second. On the first day of my last year in Alvin in 2003, the day our story begins, he delivered a ten-minute monologue on the day’s news. “My Middle Eastern friend hasn’t been happy ever since we had that talk about Allah,” he said. “You know, Allah this, Allah that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">(“Welcome to Mr. McGowan’s stand-up comedy class,” whispered Booth.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I’d been feeling sort of anxious about going back to school. So, to alleviate my concerns, Booth tried to think of the <strong>worst</strong> things that could possibly happen. “Watch, you’ll get put in the Criminal Law class!” he teased me. To our friend *Brandon he said, “Your counselors will mess up your schedule so bad, you won’t be able to fix it. And, you’ll get put in Child Development with all the pregnant chicks!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">So our whole first day back at school was interesting, because yes, I did get put in Criminal Law, even though I hadn’t signed up for it. When Brandon went to the counselor that afternoon to complain about his schedule, she tried to put him in Child Development. By the end of the day Booth had also correctly predicted that *Lauren, a girl I was interested in, would call me, even though she hadn’t done so in almost two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">But we thought it was all just an incredibly weird string of coincidences—until the next day.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">New England was experiencing a tremendous electrical shortage. The night before, over 45 million Americans had lost power in eight northeastern states. Mr. McGowan decided to begin his daily monologue by plugging the virtues of the Texas electrical system when compared to the infrastructures of New York and California (which was currently going through a recall election in which actor Arnold Schwarzenegger was the clear frontrunner).</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">           </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“See, here we have a superior electrical system,” said Mr. McGowan, slowly warming up to his audience. “On the East coast, their facilities are sixty and seventy years old, and no one even knows how to fix ‘em anymore. Whenever a generator blows, they have to call out these really old men to take care of it. That’s why the New York electrical system <strong>sucks</strong>!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Booth leaned over and whispered, “Watch, the lights suddenly go out!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Oh, and Ah-nold!” said Mr. McGowan, shaking his head and grinning slightly. “Can you imagine? ‘Governor Schwarzenegger, we have a problem with immigration!’” He held up an imaginary gun. “<strong>‘I VILL TAKE CARE OF IT!’”</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">But at that moment the laughter of the class was interrupted by the lights going out. There’d been a power spike across the entire east side of Alvin and over a thousand homes had lost power.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Booth denied it as best he could, but I could no longer doubt it: he was a prophet. Something strange and uncanny was happening in Alvin, and him and me and Brandon were about to be swept up in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">*           *           *</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Brandon and I became convinced that tragedy was going to strike our campus. In the swirl and haze of late summer, omens were all around us. Thirteen ravens sitting on a power line, the mysterious imprint of a child’s hand on the window of a car, the continual recurrence of the number 42. One Sunday the <em>Houston Chronicle</em>’s daily Bible verse was Isaiah 13:13, in which God warns that judgment is about to fall on the land.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">On the thirteenth day of school the three of us took a walk around campus during our last class, and we saw some strange things. Total strangers who looked just like people we knew (“Doppelgangers,” I explained to Brandon. “Omens of death”). Two ambulances flashing their sirens in the exact same place. (We fled when we heard a third one coming).</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">The whole day had a weird, uncanny quality about it. Booth and I spent most of the evening on the phone, speculating about what it all could mean. But then at about a quarter to nine, Brandon called and explained everything. The parents of a good friend of ours had just been caught up in a high-speed police chase. A man had rammed their car, and the three of them had been life-flighted to a hospital.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Do you need me to spell it out for you, Boze?” said Brandon darkly. “We know two of the three people in that accident. Just like we <strong>saw </strong>three ambulances, but only heard the third one.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“We saw it,” I said quietly, my eyes brimming with sudden awareness. “We saw the whole thing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Yes,” said Brandon. “And this is only the beginning. Whoever is behind this is trying to warn us of something. Something big that’s about to happen. Someone is going to die, unless we can stop it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">*           *           *</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">The whole world had become a secret code begging to be deciphered by us. At first it was an exhilarating feeling, being privy to secrets that were hidden from the rest of our classmates and teachers. Mr. McGowan, the only person who seemed willing to listen, encouraged us to stay alert and pay attention to the numbers and patterns all around us.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">He urged me to keep journaling our encounters, but he also advised caution. “Your senses are keen and you’re making connections; you just may not be correct about them. That’s the strength of a novel: it’s <strong>fun</strong>.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And it was, at first. But the longer it went on, the lonelier I felt. I was getting trapped in the maze of my own connections, and I wanted out, but there was no way back. Sometimes when I went into the cafeteria at lunch I would see four people I knew in succession, and the order in which I saw them would show me, with uncanny precision, how my relationships would unfold going into the next semester: which of my friends would suddenly betray me, which one would make an unexpected return to my life. And I was never wrong, and it was scary, in a way, because I felt sure I could see the future but I didn’t have anyone else except Brandon and Booth who believed me, and increasingly I felt isolated even from them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And sometimes I wondered if I really <em>was </em>crazy, like that woman in the old song “who wrote poems to Jimmy Carter but forgot to feed her kids.” Though, as the first trimester of school wore on, a lot of strange things were happening and people were beginning to notice. Booth and our friend *Adriana had the same dream on the same night. I heard the exact words Brandon was thinking, as though he had said them aloud, as I lay on the floor half-asleep. Mr. McGowan’s wife saw an angel in their house.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">*           *           *</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">In November I reconnected with *Blazes O’Reilly, a friend who had recently left Alvin to attend an advanced school for mathematics in north Texas. Blazes had been in love with Booth for a long time. (Those were his two major temptations, he had once told me: homosexuality and witchcraft). Before we’d been on the phone for more than a minute I asked if anything strange had happened to him lately.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Funny you should ask,” he said. He told me that since the middle of August demons had tried to possess him on ten different occasions. He would start cursing and throw his promise ring across the room. “It’s like Satan and the angels are fighting a war over my body,” he explained matter-of-factly.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“And what do you think it all means?” I asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Well, I was going to say, you’re going to think I’m crazy, but after the story you just told me, I’d be very surprised. I think we’re heading into a major spiritual battle, possibly the <strong>final </strong>battle, and both sides are gathering their key forces for a major offensive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Blazes O’Reilly seemed to think I had a major role to play in the final end-times battle. That was insane, crazy. I told no one what he had said to me on the phone that night, because my reputation had already suffered enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">A few weeks later, on a cool, sunny Saturday, Adriana came and sat down next to me at a UIL competition in San Antonio. She was a thin, quiet girl with short black hair and blue, sprightly eyes, and every time she watched the trailer for <em>The Return of the King</em> she wept, because it reminded her “of the great battle that is coming for us all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“What would you say if I told you that Jesus is going to return in our lifetime,” she asked me, “and that I will be one of his closest followers?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I was too polite to tell Adriana what I really thought, which is that it sounded like Satan was preparing her heart to receive the Antichrist.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">But apparently Adriana had similar feelings. Feeling encouraged by our conversation, she wrote me a letter that weekend. In it she revealed the horrible truth about her life. In dreams and visions God had shown her that she was soon going to meet the Antichrist. She would fall hopelessly in love with him, and the fall of men would begin.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“In a battle,” she wrote, “my love will be wounded and killed, though not by my hand, and he rises again. In the last battle, I am able to get past his defenses and, in the most horrifying moment of my life, kill the darkest love in the universe. And though I realize that I have saved my life and my fellow men, I know that my life will never be normal. I will never again feel the all-powerful passion of that love or the security of that touch. Though I know it was worth it, I can’t help but hate the loneliness that will accompany me for the rest of my life.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Can I deny this fate and give it to someone else? And if I do, will there be someone to answer my call? Am I the only one who can achieve this end? I need to talk to someone, but no one but you believes me.”</span></p>
