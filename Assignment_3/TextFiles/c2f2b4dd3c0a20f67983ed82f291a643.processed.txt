[9]That time of the year: Hollywood and piracy

   By [10]moviedisplay

   Just like the weather here in Sweden started out slow, so did the
   blockbuster season this summer. Compared to 2013 (with movies like Iron
   Man 3, Man of Steel and Despicable Me 2) it was a 20% difference, even
   though there was new superhero movies, the return of Godzilla and then
   came Transformers: Age of Extinction which has made more than a billion
   dollars. And, if that wasn’t enough, along came Guardians of the Galaxy
   and made, not only a lot of money, but more money on it’s opening
   weekend (around 20 million dollars) then expected. So, everything is
   good again right? We still have a blockbuster season and movies that
   makes millions and millions of money?


   Well, along came a little movie called The Expendables 3 that had it’s
   theatrical premiere this august. Building on a franchise and having
   several big action names in the cast a movie like this should have a
   solid fan base and a good run. But, there was just one thing. Two weeks
   before it premiered it leaked online. While not the first time a big
   budget Hollywood studio movie leaked, it still was different from the
   Wolverine: Origins leak of 2009. While the leak of Wolverine: Origins
   was an unfinished movie, lacking CGI, whereas the leaked version of The
   Expendables 3 was a finished version with DVD quality. To this day,
   there has been 2.2 million downloads, estimated to have taken around 4
   millions dollars from the box office.

   The Expendables 3 hasn’t really worked out as well as the first two
   movies and with the leak the discussion has of course been, is this due
   to piracy?

   In a blog post by Lexi Alexander, director of movies such as Punisher:
   War Zone, she says piracy is less to blame then the Hollywood studios
   producing movies directed by white men, aimed at white men. She writes
   that instead of blaming loss of money and jobs in the film industry on
   piracy, the should use the money for fighting piracy to promote/help
   smaller productions, and movies made not only white men. She continues
   with the statement that the studios wants you to pay for a movie
   because the guys on the floor gets their paycheck from your money isn’t
   really true. While they do, she says studios has no interest in looking
   after the guy on the floor. Studios move CGI effect production from
   American companies to cheaper ones in other countries (see Life of Pi
   and the discussion about this around last years Academy Award) and does
   nothing to provide a better work environment for the normal guy (or
   girl) on the floor. While I agree she has a point about this (see how
   many women that has won academy awards for best picture/direction) it’s
   1) not a given that this would generate more money for the movie
   industry and 2) is not excuse for piracy. Nor does it differentiate
   between major Hollywood studio productions and smaller independent
   productions.


   While some people claim that a leak actually is a good thing since it
   generate a buzz for the movie, one must keep in mind that if this is
   true, studios would make sure movies leaked. If a leak or a pirated
   movie would mean a better theatrical run, it would happen more often.
   The movie industry, with MPAA has more or less declared war on piracy,
   taking it to the length of trying to change laws in different countries
   regarding piracy and copyright.


   While not in anyway a new problem – to be honest, Hollywood as a base
   of of movie production was for one reason to get away from East coast
   producers, studios and copyright holders (back in those days traveling
   cost to cost was not that easy) and movies from other countries was
   screened without permits with no royalties paid. Fast track to VHS,
   when you could make copies and then to Internet, where the possibility
   to share, and receive, information started a whole new age of piracy,
   often where people behind the piracy sites makes a lot of money, not
   from the piracy itself but selling ad space on these sites. And, with
   moving production from actual film to DCP (Digital Cinema Package) I
   can just assume that making an illegal copy of a movie has become
   easier.

   There is different way to fighting this piracy. Else then legal action,
   one way is to make movies more available, making them PG13 (which
   happened with The Expendables 3, and some people claim as a reason if
   didn’t do so well) as well as having international release dates on the
   same day, or earlier (like Iron Man 3 and Captain America: The Winter
   Soldier) as in USA, even though the fact international box office
   compared to US box office has something to to with this.

   Those defending piracy often claim that the punishment is to hard, but
   with The Expendables 3 there is a number on how much the financial
   damage it does. Also, that the punishment for piracy is not in
   comparison to punishment on other crimes, and while they have a point
   in this, it says more about the punishment for the other crime, not the
   punishment for piracy.

   Last point, which is technically right, is that piracy isn’t stealing.
   Well, it isn’t stealing a DVD or a Blu-ray, but this completely misses
   the point. A movie isn’t a disc. The disc is simply the storage media
   that the movie is stored on. When discussing piracy and “piracy isn’t
   stealing” I think this is an issue that’s needs to be kept in mind.
   There is a substantial difference between a movie and the storage media
   it is on.


   And, you know, the statement that piracy is good because it generates a
   buzz and free PR for the movie? (Like the idea that a leak generates a
   buzz for it’s theatrical release).  The fact is the studios these days
   does extensive ad runs when they release a movie, and does not need the
   imagined buzz that piracy defenders claim.  While this is more an issue
   of promotion costs, some movies with smaller production budgets
   actually cost more to promote then to produce. Case in point, Joe
   Carnahan’s Stretch (starring Chris Pine and Jessica Alba), with a
   production budget of 5 million dollars would, according to Universal,
   cost at least 20 million dollars to promote and put in cinemas.


   Back to piracy: what’s the easiest way to fight piracy? It’s easy.
   Don’t download movies. It doesn’t help movies, it kills them. And if
   you don’t believe me, ask Chloe Gracë Moretz who said that piracy
   killed Kick-Ass 3.

   *UPDATE*
   As you probably heard, this is the worst summer in 17 years in USA.
   Transformer: Age of Exctinction, with a box office on more than 1
   billion dollars, “only” made 245 million dollars in USA (less than it’s
   production budget) and Guardians of the Galaxy, with a box office on
   586 million dollars, “only” made 295 millon dollars in USA. This is the
   first time since 2001 that no movie has had an dometstic box office of
   at least 300 million dollars.
