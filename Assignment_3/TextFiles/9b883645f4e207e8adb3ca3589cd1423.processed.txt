   Week Four Recap

   The Ironmen “defended their house” well vs. the South Hills Saints with
   wins by all three teams and two shutouts. The fact that rain in the
   forecast stayed away certainly helped put plenty of fans in the stands
   and boost concession sales. The day started out with the ironmen
   Developmental team giving up their first points of the season in a 14-6
   victory of the Saints JV team (yes, their JV team!). The undefeated and
   yet unscored upon Ironmen JV followed by posting another shutout, 36-0!
   The final game was exciting as the Varsity won 20-0 with a great
   defensive performance. We are now at the half-way point of the regular
   season and both our JV and Varsity programs are in a good position to
   enter the playoffs a month from now. Making the playoffs has become an
   annual tradition for both our teams with last year’s JV team winning it
   all. THE EVOLUTION CONTINUES!
