About Niraj Warikoo

   [13]Follow @nwarikoo

   Niraj Warikoo is the religion reporter for the [14]Detroit Free Press.
   He graduated from [15]Columbia College at Columbia University with a
   bachelor’s degree in political science and from[16] Columbia’s Graduate
   School of Journalism with a masters degree in journalism.  Over the
   past decade, he’s written extensively about how the war on terrorism
   impacted metro Detroit’s diverse communities. Since 1998, he’s covered
   the biggest Arab-American population in the U.S.  In 2005, he was
   selected to be [17]a fellow at the University of Southern California,
   where he studied national security and civil liberties in the post 9-11
   era.   In 2008, he was invited to give a presentation on the
   relationship between American Muslims and the U.S. government at the
   [18]School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in the University of
   London in England for an international conference on Islam in the West
   that featured experts and leaders from Europe, the U.S., and Arab
   world.  He received a first-place award in 2011 from SPJ-Detroit for
   his exclusive coverage of the FBI shooting death of a Muslim
   leader from Detroit and is a finalist for a national NABJ award in
   investigative reporting.

   Warikoo has been an invited speaker or panelist at universities such as
   the [19]University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan State, and Wayne
   State; and at the national conventions of [20]IRE (Investigative
   Reporters and Editors), [21]AAJA, [22]SAJA, [23]UNITY, and
   [24]Poynter’s National Writers Workshop.   He’s appeared on local and
   national TV and radio programs such as [25]C-SPAN, [26]CNN, [27]CNN
   Headline News , [28]MSNBC (Hardball Show with Chris
   Matthews, [29]Alison Stewart and [30]Contessa Brewer),  and[31] NPR’s
   Tell me More with Michel Martin (National Public Radio.)  In previous
   years, he wrote often about workplace safety issues,
   including investigative reports that exposed corporate negligence in
   the deaths of six workers at the Ford Rouge plant in Dearborn,
   Michigan. Warikoo also has examined the environmental destruction of
   Michigan’s wetlands in a special report based on new data he
   obtained.   In 2005, he visited [32]Walter Reed Army Medical Center in
   Washington D.C. to write about U.S. soldiers who became amputees after
   serving in Iraq; the story examined how new technology has improved
   survival chances, but also brings recovery challenges for victims. In
   2006, he traveled across Lebanon to write stories for the Detroit Free
   Press on the aftermath of the war between Hizballah and Israel,
   which affected communities in metro Detroit.

   Warikoo has written often about Michigan’s immigrant communities, from
   the lives of Mexican-Americans to Vietnamese Catholics, as well as  the
   region’s Arab-American and Muslim population —  the highest
   concentration in the U.S.   His work was profiled in a [33]Poynter
   story after the Sept. 11 attacks and he became a resource for other
   journalists seeking to understand the region’s Arab and Muslim
   communities.  He covered the case of a Michigan man detained on
   terrorism suspicions; after the government banned him and other
   reporters from attending court hearings, his newspaper filed a lawsuit
   on his behalf that was eventually won in an appeals court.  In the run
   up to and during the Iraq war, he interviewed top leaders in Iraq’s
   government and political parties on their frequent visits to metro
   Detroit, including Iraq’s future Prime Minister.

   In recent years, he’s written about a wide range of religious issues,
   including: the Dalai Lama’s lectures in Michigan, men and masculinity
   in churches, splits within the Episcopal Church, Catholic natural
   family planning, the growing rate of Jewish interfaith marriages, and
   religious belief in the end of times.  In 2010, he wrote a special
   report that revealed the use of secret informants in the
   counter-terrorism case of a Muslim leader killed in a shootout in
   Dearborn with FBI agents.  Also this year, he was the lead reporter on
   the FBI raid and arrests of members of a Christian militia in Michigan
   called Hutaree allegedly plotting against the U.S. government.  Outside
   of work, Warikoo enjoys listening to music; he played the piano and
   trumpet for 10 years.

       There is only one God the God of the Jew’s. There is only one son
       of God, Jesus Christ. There was only one False Prophet Muhammad,
       and he named the Anti-Christ, Allah.
