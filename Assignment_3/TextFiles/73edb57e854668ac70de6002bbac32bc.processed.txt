   [35]o-CHARISMA-NEWS-570

   Not long ago I watched the film We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011), a
   bleak tragedy starring Tilda Swindon as a mom who suspects that her
   adolescent son has some serious behavioral and mental issues. Her
   husband shrugs it off, thinking it’s just a phase he’ll grow out of.
   She watches with an increasingly helpless feeling as he becomes more
   and more dangerous, ultimately shooting up his high school, and killing
   most of his family, with a bow-and-arrow set.

   That’s how I’ve been feeling for much of the summer as I read
   CharismaNews.com every morning and scanned the comments. I understand
   that the magazine was once [36]the flagship publication of the
   Charismatic / Pentecostal movement, and that there are still [37]many
   sincere, good-hearted people who work there. This is not a judgment on
   them.

   That being said, we need to address what Charisma is turning into.
   Something has gone dangerously awry inside the once-venerated
   institution. It is not healthy. It is not good. And, more and more, it
   is not safe.

   First, as I read, I saw that many of the articles were beginning to
   sport sensational headlines that prominently targeted a hated group or
   individual and offered them up as rage-bait for Christian viewers:

   “President Obama, You Have Crossed a Dangerous, Unprecedented Line.”

   “Some Honest Questions for Professing ‘Gay Christians.’”

   “Vicki Beeching and the Reason So Many ‘Christians’ are Coming Out as
   Gay.”

   “A Shameful Day in Christian Publishing” (accompanied by a picture of
   young Evangelical author [38]Matt Vines).

   Second, based on the comments section it became clear that the site was
   attracting a toxic demographic: people who were willing to believe any
   slander, embrace any accusation, as long as it was directed at someone
   they were predisposed to hate. I watched them arguing with
   non-believers and less extreme Christians (who were invariably labeled
   “trolls” and “atheists” and told they were going to hell because the
   Bible says so). They were immune to reason, immune to all appeals for
   compassion, immune to any scriptures that contradicted their preferred
   narrative of fear and demonization.

   Terrifyingly, their endless diatribes against—you name it: gays,
   blacks, refugee children, pop stars, Christian entertainers, Democrats,
   evolutionists, filmmakers, conservative pastors—were routinely
   interspersed with the insistence that their venomous hate speech was
   “loving” and “holy.” Love tells the truth. Love judges. Love hates what
   is evil. Etc., etc.

   The following comment is typical:
    [39] Plantation As is this one:
    [40] Scary Posts 1
   And, with a few exceptions, it felt like the broader Christian
   community was unaware of the evils being promoted and perpetuated at
   Charisma. But two things happened last week to change that.

   First, the magazine ran an article with a shamelessly slanderous
   headline questioning the faith (and, by implication, the salvation) of
   Christian musician Michael Gungor. Gungor re-tweeted the headline,
   along with a plea for help:

   [41]Gungor


   Following a public backlash, Charisma changed the headline (but kept
   the URL). Weirdly, [42]the article itself barely mentions the divinity
   of Jesus.

   And then on Friday—I don’t know how else to put this—it ran an article
   by
   [43]Gary Cass, founder of the Christian Anti-Defamation Commission,
   [44]calling for the sterilization, deportation, and killing of all
   Muslims.

   If you haven’t actually read the article, that’s going to sound like
   the same sort of gratuitous hyperbole that Charisma traffics in. It is
   not hyperbole. Cass begins by laying out the arguments for enforced
   sterilization and deportation. But these measures will not work,
   because according to the Bible “Arab Muslims are God’s sworn enemies
   and are ordained by God to be against everyone.” Muslims, he goes on to
   say, can never be saved in large numbers. They are doomed in their
   billions to perdition.

   And what’s worse, they’re creating a hell on earth for Christian
   believers right now. “ISIS is doing . . . what every true follower of
   Muhammad wants to do to you and yours—subjugate or murder you. They
   believe they have been given a mandate by Allah (Satan) to dominate the
   world.”

   Which is why, in the end, only his last solution will be effective:

     “3. Violence. The only thing that is biblical and that 1,400 years
     of history has shown to work is overwhelming Christian just war and
     overwhelming self defense . . . This is not irrational, but the
     loving thing we must do for our children and neighbors. First trust
     in God, then obtain a gun(s), learn to shoot, teach your kids the
     Christian doctrines of just war and self defense, create small cells
     of family and friends that you can rely on if some thing
     catastrophic happens and civil society suddenly melts down . . .

     “Militant Muslims cannot live in a society based on Christian ideals
     of equality and liberty. They will always seek to harm us. Now the
     only question is how many more dead bodies will have to pile up at
     home and abroad before we crush the vicious seed of Ishmael in
     Jesus’ Name?”

    Where to begin?

    I’ve been holding my own emotions in check for much of this post
   because I wanted to be careful. Anger in the pursuit of justice can so
   easily turn us into the monsters we fight against. But this is not the
   kind of article that calls for a cautious response. A mainstream
   Christian publication, a magazine that hundreds of thousands of
   Christians read and respect, published a call for the killing of over a
   billion people. It was not subtle. It’s not like you had to read
   between the lines to realize the full horror of what he was
   advocating—he came right out and said it. You’d have to be in massive
   denial ([45]as so many were in the comments) to not see that he was
   saying what he frankly and explicitly said.

   And that scares me. Not just because my father was Muslim. But because,
   as an Irish-Pakistani-American with a bronze complexion, I don’t have
   any faith in the ability of Cass or his followers to distinguish
   between different groups of brown people.

   Because, given his ignorance of the fact that [46]only about 20 percent
   of the world’s Muslims are Arab, I wouldn’t expect Cass to know the
   difference between a radical Islamist, a Sikh, a Hindu, and a
   Palestinian Christian.

   Because it would not stop at Muslims. Because the commenters who lapped
   up that article, who overwhelmingly applauded Cass’s call to violent
   action against their Muslim neighbors, [47]like the crowd that demanded
   the death of Jesus, have already made clear that they have no tolerance
   for anyone who rejects their white fundamentalist culture and their
   extreme interpretation of Scripture. And a call for the death of all
   Muslims, printed on the front page of a widely-read Christian website,
   is a shot fired across the bow warning that none of the rest of
   us—Arabs and blacks, the university-educated, liberals, gays and
   lesbians, artists and entertainers, women, Catholics—are safe.

   But in a way, I’m grateful. Because even though the post was taken down
   following a massive public outcry on Sunday afternoon, the murderous
   spirit that was already operating at Charisma, even before last Friday,
   has been openly manifest.

   I’ve written before on this blog [48]about the pyramid of violence. The
   thing we have to realize is that the mindsets that make genocide and
   other acts of violence possible are already in place before the call to
   violence is given. It begins on the lowest levels with name-calling,
   false accusations, slander, rumors, and verbal aggression. If you’re in
   a community where people are constantly shaming you, refusing to
   acknowledge your preferred identity (“You may think you’re gay, but we
   know better”), subjecting you to de-humanizing jokes and vicious
   insults, and refusing to listen when you tell them to stop, you are
   already in danger. You are being subjected to violence, even if no
   punches have yet been thrown.

   And, as I’ve said before, if they’re already not listening when you
   tell them to stop verbally abusing you, if the Bible is already
   powerless to stop them, they will not listen when you’re insisting that
   you have a right not to be physically assaulted and murdered.

   And that’s why Charisma is out of control, and that’s why it needs to
   be held to account.

   Because “Why I am Absolutely Islamaphobic” was not an isolated column,
   but only the latest and most glaring manifestation of a much larger
   problem. “Malice eats it like a cancer,” in the words of Faramir, “and
   the cancer is growing.”

   Because if you go back and read the snippets from the comments that I
   posted earlier, and the hundreds of comments in response to Cass’s
   article, it’s clear that the site has become a beacon for bullies and
   extremists, for those who don’t listen, those who despise anything
   “different” or “weird” and would not be averse to using violence to be
   rid of it.

   I realize that Internet comboxes are often cesspools of hatred and
   villainy. But until this weekend I’d never seen a commenter advocate
   the mass extermination of millions of people. The fact that this idea
   was first given voice by one of the site’s writers, in an article
   apparently read, reviewed, and printed with the editor’s stamp of
   approval, says everything you need to know about how dangerous Charisma
   has become.

   Of all the tweets I read on Sunday, this is the one that probably best
   expresses what I’ve been feeling these last couple of days:[49] Natalie

   Reading the Gospels would be a start. In the meantime we can all pray
   that God will transform them through the light of the good news about
   Jesus.

[63]The Apocalypse Has Been Postponed Until Gym: My Last Year of High School
& the End of the World [revised]

   Posted in [64]Uncategorized by [65]Boze Herrington

     ahs “But which is more important:

     To comfort an old woman

     Or see visions of the heavens

     In the stumps of fallen trees?”

                 — The Handsome Family, “Lake Geneva”

    My last year in high school was a strange time in my life.

   It’s a year that I haven’t talked much about [66]since I left the
   dangerous group a few years ago because it’s hard to describe what
   happened without sounding a little insane. But I’ll try.

   Eric Booth had been my best friend for about three or four years. To
   the rest of our friends, we were an inseparable duo, one of the classic
   teams, like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Boze and Booth. We were
   always getting into trouble and wreaking havoc.

   And we were a great match. Booth was tall, outgoing, and good with
   women. I was quiet, bookish, a little awkward, and spent most of my
   time writing down entire conversations in a notebook I carried around
   everywhere. And while I was whimsical, romantic, and full of weird
   ideas, Booth was rational, pragmatic, and rigorously logical. (Once
   when a friend boasted that she was “one in a million,” Booth did the
   math and pointed out that there were at least 6,000 of her.)

   [67]Young Boze

   Me, my senior year of high school

   Booth and I had a teacher I’ll call Mr. McGowan. Mr. McGowan was our
   European History teacher, but he seemed to view himself as an
   entertainer first and teacher second. On the first day of my last year
   in Alvin in 2003, the day our story begins, he delivered a ten-minute
   monologue on the day’s news. “My Middle Eastern friend hasn’t been
   happy ever since we had that talk about Allah,” he said. “You know,
   Allah this, Allah that…”

   (“Welcome to Mr. McGowan’s stand-up comedy class,” whispered Booth.)

   I’d been feeling sort of anxious about going back to school. So, to
   alleviate my concerns, Booth tried to think of the worst things that
   could possibly happen. “Watch, you’ll get put in the Criminal Law
   class!” he teased me. To our friend *Brandon he said, “Your counselors
   will mess up your schedule so bad, you won’t be able to fix it. And,
   you’ll get put in Child Development with all the pregnant chicks!”

   So our whole first day back at school was interesting, because yes, I
   did get put in Criminal Law, even though I hadn’t signed up for it.
   When Brandon went to the counselor that afternoon to complain about his
   schedule, she tried to put him in Child Development. By the end of the
   day Booth had also correctly predicted that *Lauren, a girl I was
   interested in, would call me, even though she hadn’t done so in almost
   two years.

   But we thought it was all just an incredibly weird string of
   coincidences—until the next day.

   New England was experiencing a tremendous electrical shortage. The
   night before, over 45 million Americans had lost power in eight
   northeastern states. Mr. McGowan decided to begin his daily monologue
   by plugging the virtues of the Texas electrical system when compared to
   the infrastructures of New York and California (which was currently
   going through a recall election in which actor Arnold Schwarzenegger
   was the clear frontrunner).

   “See, here we have a superior electrical system,” said Mr. McGowan,
   slowly warming up to his audience. “On the East coast, their facilities
   are sixty and seventy years old, and no one even knows how to fix ‘em
   anymore. Whenever a generator blows, they have to call out these really
   old men to take care of it. That’s why the New York electrical system
   sucks!”

   Booth leaned over and whispered, “Watch, the lights suddenly go out!”

   “Oh, and Ah-nold!” said Mr. McGowan, shaking his head and grinning
   slightly. “Can you imagine? ‘Governor Schwarzenegger, we have a problem
   with immigration!’” He held up an imaginary gun. “‘I VILL TAKE CARE OF
   IT!’”

   But at that moment the laughter of the class was interrupted by the
   lights going out. There’d been a power spike across the entire east
   side of Alvin and over a thousand homes had lost power.

   Booth denied it as best he could, but I could no longer doubt it: he
   was a prophet. Something strange and uncanny was happening in Alvin,
   and him and me and Brandon were about to be swept up in it.

   *           *           *

   Brandon and I became convinced that tragedy was going to strike our
   campus. In the swirl and haze of late summer, omens were all around us.
   Thirteen ravens sitting on a power line, the mysterious imprint of a
   child’s hand on the window of a car, the continual recurrence of the
   number 42. One Sunday the Houston Chronicle’s daily Bible verse was
   Isaiah 13:13, in which God warns that judgment is about to fall on the
   land.

   On the thirteenth day of school the three of us took a walk around
   campus during our last class, and we saw some strange things. Total
   strangers who looked just like people we knew (“Doppelgangers,” I
   explained to Brandon. “Omens of death”). Two ambulances flashing their
   sirens in the exact same place. (We fled when we heard a third one
   coming).

   The whole day had a weird, uncanny quality about it. Booth and I spent
   most of the evening on the phone, speculating about what it all could
   mean. But then at about a quarter to nine, Brandon called and explained
   everything. The parents of a good friend of ours had just been caught
   up in a high-speed police chase. A man had rammed their car, and the
   three of them had been life-flighted to a hospital.

   “Do you need me to spell it out for you, Boze?” said Brandon darkly.
   “We know two of the three people in that accident. Just like we saw
   three ambulances, but only heard the third one.”

   “We saw it,” I said quietly, my eyes brimming with sudden awareness.
   “We saw the whole thing.”

   “Yes,” said Brandon. “And this is only the beginning. Whoever is behind
   this is trying to warn us of something. Something big that’s about to
   happen. Someone is going to die, unless we can stop it.”

   *           *           *

    The whole world had become a secret code begging to be deciphered by
   us. At first it was an exhilarating feeling, being privy to secrets
   that were hidden from the rest of our classmates and teachers. Mr.
   McGowan, the only person who seemed willing to listen, encouraged us to
   stay alert and pay attention to the numbers and patterns all around us.

    He urged me to keep journaling our encounters, but he also advised
   caution. “Your senses are keen and you’re making connections; you just
   may not be correct about them. That’s the strength of a novel: it’s
   fun.”

    And it was, at first. But the longer it went on, the lonelier I felt.
   I was getting trapped in the maze of my own connections, and I wanted
   out, but there was no way back. Sometimes when I went into the
   cafeteria at lunch I would see four people I knew in succession, and
   the order in which I saw them would show me, with uncanny precision,
   how my relationships would unfold going into the next semester: which
   of my friends would suddenly betray me, which one would make an
   unexpected return to my life. And I was never wrong, and it was scary,
   in a way, because I felt sure I could see the future but I didn’t have
   anyone else except Brandon and Booth who believed me, and increasingly
   I felt isolated even from them.

    And sometimes I wondered if I really was crazy, like that woman in the
   old song “who wrote poems to Jimmy Carter but forgot to feed her kids.”
   Though, as the first trimester of school wore on, a lot of strange
   things were happening and people were beginning to notice. Booth and
   our friend *Adriana had the same dream on the same night. I heard the
   exact words Brandon was thinking, as though he had said them aloud, as
   I lay on the floor half-asleep. Mr. McGowan’s wife saw an angel in
   their house.

   *           *           *

   In November I reconnected with *Blazes O’Reilly, a friend who had
   recently left Alvin to attend an advanced school for mathematics in
   north Texas. Blazes had been in love with Booth for a long time. (Those
   were his two major temptations, he had once told me: homosexuality and
   witchcraft). Before we’d been on the phone for more than a minute I
   asked if anything strange had happened to him lately.

   “Funny you should ask,” he said. He told me that since the middle of
   August demons had tried to possess him on ten different occasions. He
   would start cursing and throw his promise ring across the room. “It’s
   like Satan and the angels are fighting a war over my body,” he
   explained matter-of-factly.

   “And what do you think it all means?” I asked.

   “Well, I was going to say, you’re going to think I’m crazy, but after
   the story you just told me, I’d be very surprised. I think we’re
   heading into a major spiritual battle, possibly the final battle, and
   both sides are gathering their key forces for a major offensive.”

   Blazes O’Reilly seemed to think I had a major role to play in the final
   end-times battle. That was insane, crazy. I told no one what he had
   said to me on the phone that night, because my reputation had already
   suffered enough.

   A few weeks later, on a cool, sunny Saturday, Adriana came and sat down
   next to me at a UIL competition in San Antonio. She was a thin, quiet
   girl with short black hair and blue, sprightly eyes, and every time she
   watched the trailer for The Return of the King she wept, because it
   reminded her “of the great battle that is coming for us all.”

   “What would you say if I told you that Jesus is going to return in our
   lifetime,” she asked me, “and that I will be one of his closest
   followers?”

   I was too polite to tell Adriana what I really thought, which is that
   it sounded like Satan was preparing her heart to receive the
   Antichrist.

   But apparently Adriana had similar feelings. Feeling encouraged by our
   conversation, she wrote me a letter that weekend. In it she revealed
   the horrible truth about her life. In dreams and visions God had shown
   her that she was soon going to meet the Antichrist. She would fall
   hopelessly in love with him, and the fall of men would begin.

   “In a battle,” she wrote, “my love will be wounded and killed, though
   not by my hand, and he rises again. In the last battle, I am able to
   get past his defenses and, in the most horrifying moment of my life,
   kill the darkest love in the universe. And though I realize that I have
   saved my life and my fellow men, I know that my life will never be
   normal. I will never again feel the all-powerful passion of that love
   or the security of that touch. Though I know it was worth it, I can’t
   help but hate the loneliness that will accompany me for the rest of my
   life.

   “Can I deny this fate and give it to someone else? And if I do, will
   there be someone to answer my call? Am I the only one who can achieve
   this end? I need to talk to someone, but no one but you believes me.”

   *           *           *

   On the night I returned home from a long trip at the end of January, I
   called Booth and he filled me in on what had happened in Alvin during
   the week I was gone.

   Winter had taken over our high school. Friends were behaving
   differently, not like themselves at all. They were grumpy and
   depressed. They walked through the halls with scowls on their faces,
   barely lifting their heads to greet one another. Even the timid and
   pure were drinking, throwing wild parties, having sex. Booth had been
   invited to an orgy, but politely declined: he could see what the lure
   of sexual temptation was doing to the rest of his friends, and it
   scared him.

   But the biggest changes of all had taken place in Brandon. He had
   injured himself playing soccer and was no longer sure he would be able
   to attend the school of his dreams. His teammates had held him down and
   shaved his head. Now he was bald and wore a hood all the time like a
   Sith lord.

   And he hated me. “I hate Boze,” he told Booth. “And you’re turning into
   him!”

   For much of the first half of the school year Booth had been skeptical
   of our prophetic encounters and the battle that Adriana and I both felt
   was coming to our campus. But now he was beginning to reconsider. He
   told me how Brandon had yelled at a girl and threatened her with a
   baseball bat because she took a kitten that he wanted. He related how
   Mr. McGowan had snapped in the middle of class and started running
   through the room with a pair of scissors, screaming and laughing.

   “I walk through the halls in the mornings,” said Booth, “and all I can
   see are faces of despair. I look into their eyes, and there is no hope.
   One by one, it’s overtaking everyone.”

   It was after midnight. Booth told me to hang on for a second and put
   down the phone. When he returned a moment later, there was a note of
   worry in his voice.

   “I don’t know what that was,” he said. “There was this thing, this
   noise… I think it was coming from under my bed…”

   And then, without any warning, he began yelling hysterically.

   He took the phone and ran from the room. From the safety of the
   kitchen, clutching a knife, he explained to me what had happened. There
   was a heavy breathing sound, and at first he thought it was the cat.
   But the cat was in the other room, and the noise was getting louder,
   and closer…

   When Booth’s parents found him sleeping in the hall the next morning,
   they grounded him. But it didn’t matter. He knew what he had heard that
   night, and for the first time all year we were unequivocally on the
   same side. Too long had the darkness lingered. It was time to take back
   our campus.

   *           *           *

   Over the Christmas holidays Blazes O’Reilly had returned home and
   summoned a council. Though I had not mentioned to him the specifics of
   Adriana’s prophecy, I told him I felt they needed to become better
   acquainted, so the three of us gathered one wintry night in a back room
   of his parents’ house.

   The reception was not cordial. From the beginning of the meeting
   Adriana sensed a dark aura around Blazes, “the darkest I’ve ever seen.”
   At one point when he left the room to make tea, she confided, “My
   voices just told me not to trust him, because he’s been tempted”—an
   assertion that was seemingly affirmed a moment later when he returned
   and told her as much of his story as he had already told me. How could
   she possibly have known that? I wondered.

   For his part, Blazes swore he could see spirits of deception circling
   around Adriana. “There were three of them,” he explained with a casual
   air. “They were each taking turns whispering lies in her ear.”

   Oddly, though, Blazes couldn’t deny that he felt a strong sense of
   destiny about her. “I just have this feeling about her, like our fates
   are intertwined. Like we’re destined to fight to the death. Kind of
   like Lucifer and Gabriel, only I’m not sure which of us is which.”

   Adriana was sure, though. “My voices have shown me,” she said, “that
   Blazes is the Antichrist!”

   *           *           *

   For my own part, God had revealed to me during the break that Lauren
   and I would be sexually tempted in the first week of March. Each of us
   who were called to be players in the end-time drama would be tempted by
   the end of the trimester. Whether we passed on to the next stage of our
   mission would depend on whether or not we passed the test.

   As if to confirm my suspicions, my first week back on campus I was
   propositioned by a sweet blonde girl with a twangy East Texas accent
   and her best friend in gym class. They wanted to know if I would have a
   threesome with them. I reached into my tote bag and pulled out a copy
   of the most recent edition of the school newspaper, in which I had
   written a long article about the importance of saving yourself for
   marriage. They read the article with expressions of deep fascination
   and thanked me. I implored Booth not to tell anyone else, but the whole
   school knew before lunch.

   As a result of some back-room finagling, I began giving a short message
   on the intercom every morning right after the Pledge of Allegiance. I
   urged the campus to pursue joy and beauty and resist the darkness that
   was seeking to devour. Together Booth and I wrote six pages in the next
   issue of the newspaper exclusively devoted to that subject. I
   negotiated with Mr. McGowan to let me teach European History for an
   entire week, and performed a spontaneous musical with Booth on the
   importance of enjoying life.

   *           *           *

   We waited for the first week of March, for the end of the second
   trimester.

   I began having utterly terrifying dreams in which I seemed to be
   traveling out of my body at night and wandering through the rooms and
   halls of the trailer in which I lived. There were things in my bedroom
   I had never seen before. I heard footsteps in the hallway and saw
   strange lights outside my window.

   I received my letter of acceptance from Southwestern University. I
   wondered if it was wise to go. I thought about staying in Alvin and
   fighting alongside my friends in the battle that was soon to come.

   And then the trimester ended. We all settled into our new classes. And
   nothing happened.

   There was no battle, no moment of tempting. Lauren started dating a guy
   she had met two weeks before. And I could feel the ground giving way
   beneath my feet.

   *           *           *

   On a quiet and warm afternoon near the end of that week, Booth,
   Adriana, and I sat facing Mr. McGowan from across the desk in his
   classroom. We were all disconsolate and hoped he could give us answers.

   Adriana told the story of how she had nearly died the summer before,
   and how she began hearing the voices shortly after. Booth and I tried
   to explain all that had happened since Christmas, but it was clear from
   the moment we began talking that Mr. McGowan didn’t believe us. And by
   the time we related how Adriana learned that Blazes was the Antichrist,
   and how Blazes himself seemed to think that he was, and how we had
   briefly debated using physical force to try and subdue him, small beads
   of sweat were breaking out on the sides of his round face.

   I watched him imploringly. I just wanted someone to explain what was
   going on. My prophetic gift had never been wrong before. Why had it
   failed me now, at the most critical time?

   “First of all,” he said, in a very low and quiet voice, “what you’re
   going through is not unusual.”

   I’m not sure what I had been expecting, but it wasn’t this. “Are you
   serious?” I asked.

   He nodded. “For one, the three of you are reading from a shared text.
   Whenever three or four people read from a shared text, it’s not hard to
   induce shared delusions.

   “Second, I think you’re scared. You’re scared because you’re about to
   graduate, Boze, and you two will be graduating in about a year. And
   you’re leaving the only home you’ve ever known, and that’s an
   incredibly traumatic experience. And it’s not uncommon for students who
   are juniors and seniors in high school to start having apocalyptic
   visions, because it’s their way of expressing kind of the terror they
   feel at the future.

   “Because, let’s face it, the world may not be ending, but the only
   world you’ve ever known is ending. You know how they say, ‘You can’t go
   home again.’ You may come back in a few years, but the school that you
   knew will be gone. Reality won’t live up to your memories. When you go
   away to college, you’ll forget about me. And when you think about me at
   all, you’ll think of me as some sophomoric teacher who liked to pretend
   he knew everything. But I don’t. And some day you’ll realize that.”

   My entire experience of the last eight months, all I had felt and
   foreseen and suffered, was slipping away. The apocalypse wasn’t going
   to happen, it might never happen, or else it had been postponed. But I
   was determined to hold on.

   “What about all the others?” I asked. “We’re not the only ones. What
   about Blazes?”

   Mr. McGowan shook his head. “There’s something very dark and unnatural
   about that man,” he said. “He went wrong somewhere… became something
   different than what God intended.”

   He stood up summarily from his desk, as though to suggest that the
   meeting was over. Together the four of us walked to the door.

   Booth turned in the doorway and faced him.

   “I do have a question,” he said. “Was it you? Were you the one who
   orchestrated… you know, all of that?”

   Mr. McGowan stared at him quizzically. “No,” he said with finality.

   We waited. I looked at him, more confused than ever.

   “Do you mean, was I pandering and manipulating you?” He laughed
   lightly. “Oh, of course.”

   He clapped us both hard on the shoulders. “It was quite fun, actually.
   I’m honestly kind of sad it took y’all that long to figure it out. Your
   senses were picking up on stuff, but I was putting a spin on it. It’s
   good that you wanted an order to life, but you have to want it in order
   to see it. That’s why the super-sensible is so hard for empiricists to
   get.”

   He closed the door behind us. Adriana and Booth and I walked forward
   into the harsh sunlight.

   *           *           *

   It’s been ten years since that conversation in Mr. McGowan’s room, but
   the course my life has taken since graduation has been in a lot of ways
   a vindication of his warnings. Sociologists tell us that conspiracy
   theories and apocalyptic thinking are deeply intertwined, and that
   wherever you find one, you’re likely to find the other. It’s a
   pathology in the American psyche, a sickness, this fascination with the
   end times. There’s something deeply un-Christian about it. It’s as
   though Jesus and the Bible have become nothing more than cultural
   totems with the power to drive us mad.

   I’ve held on to my faith, but just barely. The realization that I was
   not a prophet was devastating, but what has been much worse is seeing
   the damage caused by End-Times fanaticism, the toll that it takes. I’ve
   seen it drive otherwise sane people to the brink of madness. I’ve
   watched it transform them until they were no longer recognizable, until
   they were willing to do the most horrible things to even their closest
   friends. I’ve seen it [68]claim the life of one of my dearest friends
   in the world.

   So I find myself thinking about the events of that year, and the great
   disappointment of third trimester, and Mr. McGowan’s explanation for
   what had happened to us. I think about it whenever a good Christian
   whom I respect is incredulous that I’m not prepping for the end times,
   as though it makes me some lesser species of Christian that I don’t
   have an opinion about when Jesus is coming back. I think about it when
   I’m sitting on the shuttle next to a man who wrote a 200-page book
   about the role of the nephilim in the last days that he’s trying to
   sell me, [69]when I’m in a meeting with Christian counselors who are
   demanding that I pray out loud to accept my calling to battle the
   forces of the Antichrist. I think about it whenever someone on Facebook
   tells me [70]they can’t wait to be martyred, that they hope they
   continue to laugh long after their head has been severed from their
   body.

   “Boze, where do you find these people?” Bethany once asked me, the
   first time I recounted my story—back when the dangerous group was just
   forming.

   And sometimes I listen to that song, “[71]Lake Geneva,” by The Handsome
   Family, about a woman whose husband is hospitalized because he sees
   visions of the heavens in the stumps of falling trees:


     “You remember how he cried

     When they strapped him to the stretcher

     Convinced his arms were burning

     With electricity from heaven


     “You remember how he told you

     Black holes were like Jesus

     And the crucifix was a battery

     That filled the air with fire”

   And I hear that and I think, isn’t that my story, and the story of our
   country? That we’d rather read about [72]the mysterious code that
   foretells the day of judgment than lift a finger to help the teeming
   masses on whose treatment the nations will be judged? And aren’t we a
   sick society, when conspiracy theories and end-times mania, the
   province of the young and confused and deranged and scared, are
   mistaken for true worship?

   Alvin High School, May 2004

   After my last conversation with Mr. McGowan, I accepted the nature of
   the fantasy I had been living in. I was no prophet. I wasn’t destined
   for greatness. The only certain thing in my life at that moment was
   graduation.

   And instead of running away from it, as I had been doing all year, I
   learned to accept it. I embraced my own normalcy, and in doing so I
   found freedom and a certain measure of happiness.

   And at the end of May I graduated and left high school behind me. I
   worry that some of us are there still.

[76]“If You’re Feeling Sinister”: A Look Back

   Posted in [77]Art & Entertainment, [78]Stories, [79]Beauty, [80]Poetry,

   [90]Boze Herrington

   [91]if-youre-feeling-sinister-belle-sebastian In 1995, Stuart Murdoch’s
   life did not seem to be moving anywhere fast. The twenty-seven-year old
   Scotsman had been suffering for upwards of six years from the effects
   of myalgic encephalomyelitis, better known as chronic fatigue syndrome.
   Because his condition made even playing on the piano an exhausting
   endeavor, he was unable to find work.

   Living in Glasgow on public assistance, Murdoch joined “beat box,” a
   government program for the unemployed. He would later compare it to a
   “refugee camp for unemployed musicians.” The unemployed took a music
   training course and played music together. Once a month they were given
   access to a recording studio.

   It was here that Murdoch first connected with the people who would form
   Belle & Sebastian; and it was here in the summer of 1996 that they
   recorded what are now widely regarded as two of the best albums of the
   1990s, Tigermilk and If You’re Feeling Sinister.

   Though the beloved indie band has covered a range of genres in their
   nearly twenty-year career, from folk to shoegaze to chamber pop, and
   has stylistically referenced bands as disparate as The Left Banke and
   The Smiths, the elegiac wistfulness of If You’re Feeling Sinister has
   become their defining sound. Even after they gained renewed critical
   acclaim and an unprecedented level of public attention with The Life
   Pursuit (2006), a collection of irresistibly danceable power-pop
   anthems, critics and long-time fans rightly pointed to their earliest
   work as their magnum opus.

   Writing and recording twenty songs in the space of a few weeks would be
   a career-worthy accomplishment for any band. But Belle & Sebastian went
   a step further, crafting songs that seem to have been whispered out of
   the ether, songs that don’t so much seem to have been written as
   captured.

   Take, for example, the Satie-like simplicity of “Fox in the Snow.” With
   piano, guitar, violin, and vibraphone, the band conjures up a serenely
   autumnal world in which soft-hearted youth have fallen on hard times.
   For me the special gift of Belle & Sebastian, my all-time favorite
   band, has always been its ability to evoke the rhythms and changes of
   the seasons, using lyrics and music to engage the senses so fully that
   it really feels as though the listener is standing on a wintry street
   corner in Edinburgh.

   Fox in the snow

   Where do you go

   To find something you can eat?

   Cause the word out on the street is

   You are starving

   If the lyrics are precious, they’re also devastatingly effective,
   compressing whole years of hope and despair and angst into the space of
   a few verses. “Fox in the Snow” showcases what would become one of
   Belle & Sebastian’s hallmarks, their knack for writing realistic,
   sharply observed character sketches about people who are young and lost
   and very much in over their heads.

   Just prior to the recording of If You’re Feeling Sinister, [93]Stuart
   had moved into a bachelor flat above a church. There he worked in the
   parish hall and sang in the choir in between writing songs for the
   album.

   “I always wanted to write about normal people doing normal things,” he
   recalls [94]in a Pitchfork documentary about the making of the album.
   “Because I wasn’t normal, I was out of the game. It was very attractive
   to me what normal people were doing.” So he set out to write songs
   about the “normal” folks he ran into in the streets and on the buses of
   Glasgow, though his own sly perceptiveness was always winking through,
   creating vividly eccentric figures who are instantly recognizable and
   yet somehow bigger than life: a track star who was driven to fame by
   the lure of getting to wear terry underwear; Hilary, who’s into S & M
   and Bible studies; Judy, who walks the streets dreaming of horses.

   Of the ten songs on this album, the penultimate song, “Boy Done Wrong
   Again,” is the weakest, a slow sleeper that saps much of the energy
   from an otherwise rollicking back half. Like Tigermilk before it, the
   album begins in minimalistic fashion, with only the quiet plucking of
   strings to accompany Murdoch’s voice. But as “Stars of Track and Field”
   progresses, the rest of the band gradually joins in, adding new
   instrumentation (organ, trumpets) layer upon layer, building slowly and
   progressively to a powerful conclusion that promises good things to
   come. “Seeing Other People” is a near-perfect evocation of early
   morning and the ambivalence of two people trying to let go of each
   other but not being able to. “Me and the Major” explores the
   unbridgeable gaps between classes and generations with lyrics that are
   both spirited and resentful: “We’re the younger generation / We grew up
   fast / All the others did drugs / They’re taking it out on us.”

   In terms of pure atmosphere, the next two songs are probably the
   album’s high point. “Like Dylan in the Movies” recalls Murdoch’s
   experience of having to walk through Kelvingrove Park, a shady Glasgow
   park. The combination of guitar, strings, and xylophone powerfully
   evokes a sense of the year ending, of autumn, and twilight. “Dylan” is
   followed by the wintry and underrated “Fox in the Snow.” The placement
   of these two songs on the album, and their musical kinship, seem to
   suggest that one is a continuation of the other. It’s worth listening
   to the two back to back.

   “Get Me Away From Here, I’m Dying” is a light rocker about a naïve
   young man. Musically it’s as good as anything on the album, but the
   lyrics are achingly, almost embarrassingly sentimental. “I always cry
   at endings,” Murdoch sings, and then, as if already regretting this
   exercise in vulnerability, adds in the next verse, “Oh, that wasn’t
   what I meant to say at all.”

   However, the shortcomings of this song are more than offset by the
   eerie brilliance of the one following. If You’re Feeling Sinister’s
   title track is also the album’s standout, with a backing track of
   children playing and enigmatic lyrics that have been variously
   explained as a satire of organized religion and the final thoughts of
   two people preparing to kill themselves.

   earch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent


   Finally, “Mayfly” is a jangly guitar ballad in the style of The Byrds,
   while “Judy and the Dream of Horses” closes the album in high spirits
   with an almost pure distillation of pop craftsmanship.

   Not satisfied with the production quality of the original recording,
   Belle & Sebastian recorded a live performance in 2005 for All
   Tomorrow’s Parties. It’s worth hearing just to assess the differences
   between the two recordings—in 1995, the band was young and unproven,
   while in 2005 it was one of the most successful indie rock bands in the
   world. But the original is the reason for their breakout success, and
   it remains the better version of their best album.

   [157]Xander zeppo

   One of the best episodes of Buffy shows Xander having his own crazy
   adventure while in the background the other Scoobies battle to save the
   world from being destroyed by a hideous monster. We catch glimpses of
   their battle throughout the episode. They’re all crying and yelling at
   each other. At the end Buffy tells Giles he did one of the bravest
   things she had ever seen (but we never learn what he did).

   It reminded me very much of the weekend in 2007 when [158]our cult had
   to unite and battle the demonic spirit that was over Southwestern: all
   the feelings that come to the surface when you’re fighting an enemy
   that only a few people are able to see.

   And then I got to thinking about… something I thought a lot about in
   the aftermath of that weekend: the scary things I used to see in my
   bedroom that weren’t normally there. [159]Traveling out of my body was
   an experience very much like that of Frodo when he put on the Ring. He
   went into another realm and could see things no one else could. And
   basically, when the group started, we were all doing that.

   And then I read a story about how Rwanda’s Christians are [160]coping
   with the aftermath of genocide by turning to Pentecostalism. It
   provides them a framework for understanding the supernatural evil that
   was unleashed on their country in 1994. This article in Foreign Policy
   magazine tells the story of a young woman named Rebecca whose family
   was offered sanctuary in a Catholic church. It turned out to be a trap,
   and her parents were killed.

   And then this happened:


     Two years later, having found a home with a foster family, Rebecca
     made friends with a girl of her own age named Alice. One day, Alice
     led her into a cemetery, and there, as Rebecca tells it, the ground
     opened up, revealing a flight of stairs that led down into the realm
     of Satan. “It was a place where there was always twilight,” says
     Rebecca. “It was a world of bad spirits. They put an evil spirit
     into my body and then they sent it back out into the world.” For the
     next five years, she says, her body wandered the land, causing ill
     wherever it could. “I had the power of causing accidents on Earth.
     The demons gave me that power.”

     It took her five years to fight her way back. She suffered terribly,
     she says. But one day she encountered a group of Pentecostal
     Christians who prayed for her release from the powers that plagued
     her. With their help she finally found release, and “accepted Jesus
     as my king.” At age 17, she converted from her ancestral Catholicism
     to the Pentecostal Church, a move that finally brought her “inner
     peace.”


   So when I think about The Children, and invisible realms that are
   super-imposed on this one, and mysterious invisible objects, and the
   Air Loom Gang, and my own made-up kingdom of Elsia, I can see a
   mythology emerging. Inevitably, I think the story will have to be about
   four or five kids who have, or think they have, unusual powers, and who
   are at war with unseen forces that no one else sees. And they belong to
   a society of people who have these gifts. And this society believes the
   end of the world is imminent. And it provides a place for the kids to
   learn and grow up and fall in love when they’re not saving the world.
   And the world itself seems to be going to pieces around them, with
   living houses and nightmare clouds and whatnot, strange disturbances in
   nature. And as the series goes on they begin to question the nature of
   their mission, especially as friends die and the “enemy” becomes not
   just invisible creatures but real people. And they begin to wonder
   whether they really are doing the right thing, and whether they’ve been
   misled, and whether the world is really ending.

[174]The Knuckles of Sam Hose

   [194]12-Years-a-Slave-Lynching-Scene-02-720x300 On April 23, 1899, a
   man named Sam Hose was stabbed, burned alive, and cut to pieces.

   Sam was a black farmhand from Georgia who was suspected of murdering
   his master. On the run from the law, he fled across country, was
   captured and taken into custody. But as he was being transported by
   train to Atlanta, word leaked out that the infamous fugitive had been
   arrested and was going to be lynched.

   Hose was hauled off the train at gunpoint and taken to a nearby farm in
   a small town while a crowd gathered round him. Some estimates place the
   size of the crowd at over 2,000 people. The news sparked a mad rush of
   worshipers from churches in Atlanta, where Sunday services were just
   ending. Demand to see the lynching was so great that the railroad
   company arranged several unscheduled runs, while those who were unable
   to buy tickets climbed in through the windows and clung to the sides of
   the trains.

   Sam Hose was chained to a pine tree. His ears and fingers were cut off,
   and as the crowd cheered, he was stabbed and set on fire, dowsed with
   kerosene they had been given by a local vendor at no cost. He tried to
   pull himself out of the fire with his fingerless hands, but was pushed
   back in.

   Twenty minutes later, he died. His last words were, “Oh my God. Oh,
   Jesus.”

   What remained of his body was cut into pieces and passed among the
   crowd as souvenirs, like a twisted form of communion. His knuckles were
   placed on display in the window of a grocery store in Atlanta.

   [195]sam-hose-1 Sam was one of 27 people lynched that year.

   This is why I can’t understand when people say America is more wicked
   than it’s ever been, when they long for the glory days of our Christian
   past. Sam Hose was murdered by the honest, God-fearing folk of Atlanta.
   Sam Hose was burned into cinders by a crowd on its way home from
   church. And when I think about the rhetoric used in our churches to
   demonize outsiders, when I think about how so many believers are
   gearing up for what they believe is an apocalyptic war between the
   forces of good and evil led by a vengeful, slaughtering messiah, I can
   no longer accept the lie that a true Christian would never be swayed by
   a mob, that we could never find ourselves fighting on the wrong side in
   the conflict of right and wrong.

   Some people say, “It’s hard to see how conditions in America could ever
   get so bad that Christians would be willing to murder.” But the truth
   is, it already happened. And it happened for a long time.

   Alvin High School, May 2004

   On the night I returned home from a long trip at the end of January, I
   called Booth and he filled me in on [258]what had happened in Alvin
   during the week I was gone.

   Winter had taken over our high school. Friends were behaving
   differently, not like themselves at all. They were grumpy and
   depressed. They walked through the halls with scowls on their faces,
   barely lifting their heads to greet one another. Even the timid and
   pure were drinking, throwing wild parties, having sex. Booth had been
   invited to an orgy, but politely declined: he could see what the lure
   of sexual temptation was doing to the rest of his friends, and it
   scared him.

   But the biggest changes of all had taken place in Brandon. He had
   injured himself playing soccer and was no longer sure he would be able
   to attend the school of his dreams. His teammates had held him down and
   shaved his head. Now he was bald and wore a hood all the time like a
   Sith lord.

   And he hated me. “I hate Boze,” he told Booth. “And you’re turning into
   him!”

   For much of the first half of the school year Booth had been skeptical
   of our prophetic encounters and the battle that Adriana and I both felt
   was coming to our campus. But now he was beginning to reconsider. He
   told me how Brandon had yelled at a girl and threatened her with a
   baseball bat because she took a kitten that he wanted. He related how
   Mr. McGowan had snapped in the middle of class and started running
   through the room with a pair of scissors, screaming and laughing.

   “I walk through the halls in the mornings,” said Booth, “and all I can
   see are faces of despair. I look into their eyes, and there is no hope.
   One by one, it’s overtaking everyone.”

   It was after midnight. Booth told me to hang on for a second and put
   down the phone. When he returned a moment later, there was a note of
   worry in his voice.

   “I don’t know what that was,” he said. “There was this thing, this
   noise… I think it was coming from under my bed…”

   And then, without any warning, he began yelling hysterically.

   He took the phone and ran from the room. From the safety of the
   kitchen, clutching a knife, he explained to me what had happened. There
   was a heavy breathing sound, and at first he thought it was the cat.
   But the cat was in the other room, and the noise was getting louder,
   and closer…

   When Booth’s parents found him sleeping in the hall the next morning,
   they grounded him. But it didn’t matter. He knew what he had heard that
   night, and for the first time all year we were unequivocally on the
   same side. Too long had the darkness lingered. It was time to take back
   our campus.

   Over the Christmas holidays Blazes O’Reilly had returned home and
   summoned a council. Though I had not mentioned to him the specifics of
   Adriana’s prophecy, I told him I felt they needed to become better
   acquainted, so the three of us gathered one wintry night in a back room
   of his parents’ house.

   The reception was not cordial. From the beginning of the meeting
   Adriana sensed a dark aura around Blazes, “the darkest I’ve ever seen.”
   At one point when he left the room to make tea, she confided, “My
   voices just told me not to trust him, because he’s been tempted”—an
   assertion that was seemingly affirmed a moment later when he returned
   and told her as much of his story as he had already told me. How could
   she possibly have known that? I wondered.

   For his part, Blazes swore he could see spirits of deception circling
   around Adriana. “There were three of them,” he explained with a casual
   air. “They were each taking turns whispering lies in her ear.”

   Oddly, though, Blazes couldn’t deny that he felt a strong sense of
   destiny about her. “I just have this feeling about her, like our fates
   are intertwined. Like we’re destined to fight to the death. Kind of
   like Lucifer and Gabriel, only I’m not sure which of us is which.”

   Adriana was sure, though. “My voices have shown me,” she said, “that
   Blazes is the Antichrist!”

   *           *           *

   For my own part, God had revealed to me during the break that Lauren
   and I would be sexually tempted in the first week of March. Each of us
   who were called to be players in the end-time drama would be tempted by
   the end of the trimester. Whether we passed on to the next stage of our
   mission would depend on whether or not we passed the test.

   As if to confirm my suspicions, my first week back on campus I was
   propositioned by a sweet blonde girl with a twangy East Texas accent
   and her best friend in gym class. They wanted to know if I would have a
   threesome with them. I reached into my tote bag and pulled out a copy
   of the most recent edition of the school newspaper, in which I had
   written a long article about the importance of saving yourself for
   marriage. They read the article with expressions of deep fascination
   and thanked me. I implored Booth not to tell anyone else, but the whole
   school knew before lunch.

   As a result of some back-room finagling, I began giving a short message
   on the intercom every morning right after the Pledge of Allegiance. I
   urged the campus to pursue joy and beauty and resist the darkness that
   was seeking to devour. Together Booth and I wrote six pages in the next
   issue of the newspaper exclusively devoted to that subject. Booth even
   penned an article about the “Economics of Joy” in which he graphed the
   school’s GDP: “Good Deeds Potential”:


    [259] GDP


   I negotiated with Mr. McGowan to let me teach European History for an
   entire week. On Friday I announced that I had brought in a motivational
   speaker, Mr. “Ebenezer Scrooge” of Scrooge & Marley’s. The entire class
   groaned as Booth strode up to the front of the room. Then, as if out of
   nowhere, music began playing. Scrooge and I spontaneously broke into a
   dance and were joined by a guy in the third row who knew all the lyrics
   to the original song (from the 1970 Scrooge musical). For four and a
   half minutes we twirled around the room and sang about the pleasures of
   enjoying life:

     Where there’s music and laughter

     Happiness is rife!

     Why?

     Because I like life!

   The entire class watched with mounting incredulity, and by the end of
   the song Lauren was in tears. “That was the most bizarre thing I’ve
   ever seen,” she said sadly. Booth and I sat quietly back down as though
   nothing had happened.


   *           *           *


   We waited for the first week of March, for the end of the second
   trimester.


   I began having utterly terrifying dreams in which I seemed to be
   traveling out of my body at night and wandering through the rooms and
   halls of the trailer in which I lived. There were things in my bedroom
   I had never seen before. I heard footsteps in the hallway and saw
   strange lights outside my window.


   I received my letter of acceptance from Southwestern University. I
   wondered if it was wise to go. I thought about staying in Alvin and
   fighting alongside my friends in the battle that was soon to come.


   And then the trimester ended. We all settled into our new classes. And
   nothing happened.


   There was no battle, no moment of tempting. Lauren started dating a guy
   she had met two weeks before. And I could feel the ground giving way
   beneath my feet.


   *           *           *


   On a quiet and warm afternoon near the end of that week, Booth,
   Adriana, and I sat facing Mr. McGowan from across the desk in his
   classroom. We were all disconsolate and hoped he could give us answers.


   Adriana told the story of how she had nearly died the summer before,
   and how she began hearing the voices shortly after. Booth and I tried
   to explain all that had happened since Christmas, but it was clear from
   the moment we began talking that Mr. McGowan didn’t believe us. And by
   the time we related how Adriana learned that Blazes was the Antichrist,
   and how Blazes himself seemed to think that he was, and how we had
   briefly debated using physical force to try and subdue him, small beads
   of sweat were breaking out on the sides of his round face.


   I watched him imploringly. I just wanted someone to explain what was
   going on. My prophetic gift had never been wrong before. Why had it
   failed me now, at the most critical time?


   “First of all,” he said, in a very low and quiet voice, “what you’re
   going through is not unusual.”


   I’m not sure what I had been expecting, but it wasn’t this. “Are you
   serious?” I asked.


   He nodded. “For one, the three of you are reading from a shared text.
   Whenever three or four people read from a shared text, it’s not hard to
   induce shared delusions.


   “Second, I think you’re scared. You’re scared because you’re about to
   graduate, Boze, and you two will be graduating in about a year. And
   you’re leaving the only home you’ve ever known, and that’s an
   incredibly traumatic experience. And it’s not uncommon for students who
   are juniors and seniors in high school to start having apocalyptic
   visions, because it’s their way of expressing kind of the terror they
   feel at the future.


   “Because, let’s face it, the world may not be ending, but the only
   world you’ve ever known is ending. You know how they say, ‘You can’t go
   home again.’ You may come back in a few years, but the school that you
   knew will be gone. Reality won’t live up to your memories. When you go
   away to college, you’ll forget about me. And when you think about me at
   all, you’ll think of me as some sophomoric teacher who liked to pretend
   he knew everything. But I don’t. And some day you’ll realize that.”


   My entire experience of the last eight months, all I had felt and
   foreseen and suffered, was slipping away. The apocalypse wasn’t going
   to happen, it might never happen, or else it had been postponed. But I
   was determined to hold on.


   “What about all the others?” I asked. “We’re not the only ones. What
   about Blazes?”


   Mr. McGowan shook his head. “There’s something very dark and unnatural
   about that man,” he said. “He went wrong somewhere… became something
   different than what God intended.”


   He stood up summarily from his desk, as though to suggest that the
   meeting was over. Together the four of us walked to the door.


   Booth turned in the doorway and faced him.


   “I do have a question,” he said. “Was it you? Were you the one who
   orchestrated… you know, all of that?”


   Mr. McGowan stared at him quizzically. “No,” he said with finality.


   We waited. I looked at him, more confused than ever.


   “Do you mean, was I pandering and manipulating you?” He laughed
   lightly. “Oh, of course.”


   He clapped us both hard on the shoulders. “It was quite fun, actually.
   I’m honestly kind of sad it took y’all that long to figure it out. Your
   senses were picking up on stuff, but I was putting a spin on it. It’s
   good that you wanted an order to life, but you have to want it in order
   to see it. That’s why the super-sensible is so hard for empiricists to
   get.”


   He closed the door behind us. Adriana and Booth and I walked forward
   into the harsh sunlight.


   *           *           *


   It’s been ten years since that conversation in Mr. McGowan’s room, but
   the course my life has taken since graduation has been in a lot of ways
   a vindication of his warnings. Sociologists tell us that conspiracy
   theories and apocalyptic thinking are deeply intertwined, and that
   wherever you find one, you’re likely to find the other. It’s a
   pathology in the American psyche, a sickness, this fascination with the
   end times. There’s something deeply un-Christian about it. It’s as
   though Jesus and the Bible have become nothing more than cultural
   totems with the power to drive us mad.


   I’ve held on to my faith, but just barely. The realization that I was
   not a prophet was devastating, but what has been much worse is seeing
   the damage caused by End-Times fanaticism, the toll that it takes. I’ve
   seen it drive otherwise sane people to the brink of madness. I’ve
   watched it transform them until they were no longer recognizable, until
   they were willing to do the most horrible things to even their closest
   friends. I’ve seen it [261]claim the life of one of my dearest friends
   in the world.


   So I find myself thinking about the events of that year, and the great
   disappointment of third trimester, and Mr. McGowan’s explanation for
   what had happened to us. I think about it whenever a good Christian
   whom I respect is incredulous that I’m not prepping for the end times,
   as though it makes me some lesser species of Christian that I don’t
   have an opinion about when Jesus is coming back. I think about it when
   I’m sitting on the shuttle next to a man who wrote a 200-page book
   about the role of the nephilim in the last days that he’s trying to
   sell me, [262]when I’m in a meeting with Christian counselors who are
   demanding that I pray out loud to accept my calling to battle the
   forces of the Antichrist. I think about it whenever someone on Facebook
   tells me [263]they can’t wait to be martyred, that they hope they
   continue to laugh long after their head has been severed from their
   body.


   “Boze, where do you find these people?” Bethany once asked me, the
   first time I recounted my story—back when the dangerous group was just
   forming.


   And sometimes I listen to that song, “[264]Lake Geneva,” by The
   Handsome Family, about a woman whose husband is hospitalized because he
   sees visions of the heavens in the stumps of falling trees:


     “You remember how he cried

     When they strapped him to the stretcher

     Convinced his arms were burning

     With electricity from heaven


     “You remember how he told you

     Black holes were like Jesus

     And the crucifix was a battery

     That filled the air with fire”


   And I hear that and I think, isn’t that my story, and the story of our
   country? That we’d rather read about [265]the mysterious code that
   foretells the day of judgment than lift a finger to help the teeming
   masses on whose treatment the nations will be judged? And aren’t we a
   sick society, when conspiracy theories and end-times mania, the
   province of the young and confused and deranged and scared, are
   mistaken for true worship?


   After my last conversation with Mr. McGowan, I accepted the nature of
   the fantasy I had been living in. I was no prophet. I wasn’t destined
   for greatness. The only certain thing in my life at that moment was
   graduation.


   And instead of running away from it, as I had been doing all year, I
   learned to accept it. I embraced my own normalcy, and in doing so I
   found freedom and a certain measure of happiness.


   And at the end of May I graduated and left high school behind me. I
   worry that some of us are there still.

     ahs “But which is more important:

     To comfort an old woman

     Or see visions of the heavens

     In the stumps of fallen trees?”

                 — The Handsome Family, “Lake Geneva”

    My last year in high school was a strange time in my life.


   It’s a year that I haven’t talked much about [325]since I left the
   dangerous group a few years ago because it’s hard to describe what
   happened without sounding a little insane. But I’ll try.


   Eric Booth had been my best friend for about three or four years. To
   the rest of our friends, we were an inseparable duo, one of the classic
   teams, like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Boze and Booth. We were
   always getting into trouble and wreaking havoc.


   And we were a great match. Booth was tall, outgoing, and good with
   women. I was quiet, bookish, a little awkward, and spent most of my
   time writing down entire conversations in a notebook I carried around
   everywhere. And while I was whimsical, romantic, and full of weird
   ideas, Booth was rational, pragmatic, and rigorously logical. (Once
   when a friend boasted that she was “one in a million,” Booth did the
   math and pointed out that there were at least 6,000 of her.)


   [326]Young Boze

   Me, my senior year of high school

   Booth and I had a teacher I’ll call Mr. McGowan. Mr. McGowan was our
   European History teacher, but he seemed to view himself as an
   entertainer first and teacher second. On the first day of my last year
   in Alvin in 2003, the day our story begins, he delivered a ten-minute
   monologue on the day’s news. “My Middle Eastern friend hasn’t been
   happy ever since we had that talk about Allah,” he said. “You know,
   Allah this, Allah that…”


   (“Welcome to Mr. McGowan’s stand-up comedy class,” whispered Booth.)


   I’d been feeling sort of anxious about going back to school. So, to
   alleviate my concerns, Booth tried to think of the worst things that
   could possibly happen. “Watch, you’ll get put in the Criminal Law
   class!” he teased me. To our friend *Brandon he said, “Your counselors
   will mess up your schedule so bad, you won’t be able to fix it. And,
   you’ll get put in Child Development with all the pregnant chicks!”


   So our whole first day back at school was interesting, because yes, I
   did get put in Criminal Law, even though I hadn’t signed up for it.
   When Brandon went to the counselor that afternoon to complain about his
   schedule, she tried to put him in Child Development. By the end of the
   day Booth had also correctly predicted that *Lauren, a girl I was
   interested in, would call me, even though she hadn’t done so in almost
   two years.


   But we thought it was all just an incredibly weird string of
   coincidences—until the next day.


   New England was experiencing a tremendous electrical shortage. The
   night before, over 45 million Americans had lost power in eight
   northeastern states. Mr. McGowan decided to begin his daily monologue
   by plugging the virtues of the Texas electrical system when compared to
   the infrastructures of New York and California (which was currently
   going through a recall election in which actor Arnold Schwarzenegger
   was the clear frontrunner).


   “See, here we have a superior electrical system,” said Mr. McGowan,
   slowly warming up to his audience. “On the East coast, their facilities
   are sixty and seventy years old, and no one even knows how to fix ‘em
   anymore. Whenever a generator blows, they have to call out these really
   old men to take care of it. That’s why the New York electrical system
   sucks!”


   Booth leaned over and whispered, “Watch, the lights suddenly go out!”


   “Oh, and Ah-nold!” said Mr. McGowan, shaking his head and grinning
   slightly. “Can you imagine? ‘Governor Schwarzenegger, we have a problem
   with immigration!’” He held up an imaginary gun. “‘I VILL TAKE CARE OF
   IT!’”


   But at that moment the laughter of the class was interrupted by the
   lights going out. There’d been a power spike across the entire east
   side of Alvin and over a thousand homes had lost power.


   Booth denied it as best he could, but I could no longer doubt it: he
   was a prophet. Something strange and uncanny was happening in Alvin,
   and him and me and Brandon were about to be swept up in it.


   *           *           *


   Brandon and I became convinced that tragedy was going to strike our
   campus. In the swirl and haze of late summer, omens were all around us.
   Thirteen ravens sitting on a power line, the mysterious imprint of a
   child’s hand on the window of a car, the continual recurrence of the
   number 42. One Sunday the Houston Chronicle’s daily Bible verse was
   Isaiah 13:13, in which God warns that judgment is about to fall on the
   land.


   On the thirteenth day of school the three of us took a walk around
   campus during our last class, and we saw some strange things. Total
   strangers who looked just like people we knew (“Doppelgangers,” I
   explained to Brandon. “Omens of death”). Two ambulances flashing their
   sirens in the exact same place. (We fled when we heard a third one
   coming).


   The whole day had a weird, uncanny quality about it. Booth and I spent
   most of the evening on the phone, speculating about what it all could
   mean. But then at about a quarter to nine, Brandon called and explained
   everything. The parents of a good friend of ours had just been caught
   up in a high-speed police chase. A man had rammed their car, and the
   three of them had been life-flighted to a hospital.


   “Do you need me to spell it out for you, Boze?” said Brandon darkly.
   “We know two of the three people in that accident. Just like we saw
   three ambulances, but only heard the third one.”


   “We saw it,” I said quietly, my eyes brimming with sudden awareness.
   “We saw the whole thing.”


   “Yes,” said Brandon. “And this is only the beginning. Whoever is behind
   this is trying to warn us of something. Something big that’s about to
   happen. Someone is going to die, unless we can stop it.”


   *           *           *


   The whole world had become a secret code begging to be deciphered by
   us. At first it was an exhilarating feeling, being privy to secrets
   that were hidden from the rest of our classmates and teachers. Mr.
   McGowan, the only person who seemed willing to listen, encouraged us to
   stay alert and pay attention to the numbers and patterns all around us.


   He urged me to keep journaling our encounters, but he also advised
   caution. “Your senses are keen and you’re making connections; you just
   may not be correct about them. That’s the strength of a novel: it’s
   fun.”


   And it was, at first. But the longer it went on, the lonelier I felt. I
   was getting trapped in the maze of my own connections, and I wanted
   out, but there was no way back. Sometimes when I went into the
   cafeteria at lunch I would see four people I knew in succession, and
   the order in which I saw them would show me, with uncanny precision,
   how my relationships would unfold going into the next semester: which
   of my friends would suddenly betray me, which one would make an
   unexpected return to my life. And I was never wrong, and it was scary,
   in a way, because I felt sure I could see the future but I didn’t have
   anyone else except Brandon and Booth who believed me, and increasingly
   I felt isolated even from them.


   And sometimes I wondered if I really was crazy, like that woman in the
   old song “who wrote poems to Jimmy Carter but forgot to feed her kids.”
   Though, as the first trimester of school wore on, a lot of strange
   things were happening and people were beginning to notice. Booth and
   our friend *Adriana had the same dream on the same night. I heard the
   exact words Brandon was thinking, as though he had said them aloud, as
   I lay on the floor half-asleep. Mr. McGowan’s wife saw an angel in
   their house.


   *           *           *


   In November I reconnected with *Blazes O’Reilly, a friend who had
   recently left Alvin to attend an advanced school for mathematics in
   north Texas. Blazes had been in love with Booth for a long time. (Those
   were his two major temptations, he had once told me: homosexuality and
   witchcraft). Before we’d been on the phone for more than a minute I
   asked if anything strange had happened to him lately.


   “Funny you should ask,” he said. He told me that since the middle of
   August demons had tried to possess him on ten different occasions. He
   would start cursing and throw his promise ring across the room. “It’s
   like Satan and the angels are fighting a war over my body,” he
   explained matter-of-factly.


   “And what do you think it all means?” I asked.


   “Well, I was going to say, you’re going to think I’m crazy, but after
   the story you just told me, I’d be very surprised. I think we’re
   heading into a major spiritual battle, possibly the final battle, and
   both sides are gathering their key forces for a major offensive.”


   Blazes O’Reilly seemed to think I had a major role to play in the final
   end-times battle. That was insane, crazy. I told no one what he had
   said to me on the phone that night, because my reputation had already
   suffered enough.


   A few weeks later, on a cool, sunny Saturday, Adriana came and sat down
   next to me at a UIL competition in San Antonio. She was a thin, quiet
   girl with short black hair and blue, sprightly eyes, and every time she
   watched the trailer for The Return of the King she wept, because it
   reminded her “of the great battle that is coming for us all.”


   “What would you say if I told you that Jesus is going to return in our
   lifetime,” she asked me, “and that I will be one of his closest
   followers?”


   I was too polite to tell Adriana what I really thought, which is that
   it sounded like Satan was preparing her heart to receive the
   Antichrist.


   But apparently Adriana had similar feelings. Feeling encouraged by our
   conversation, she wrote me a letter that weekend. In it she revealed
   the horrible truth about her life. In dreams and visions God had shown
   her that she was soon going to meet the Antichrist. She would fall
   hopelessly in love with him, and the fall of men would begin.


   “In a battle,” she wrote, “my love will be wounded and killed, though
   not by my hand, and he rises again. In the last battle, I am able to
   get past his defenses and, in the most horrifying moment of my life,
   kill the darkest love in the universe. And though I realize that I have
   saved my life and my fellow men, I know that my life will never be
   normal. I will never again feel the all-powerful passion of that love
   or the security of that touch. Though I know it was worth it, I can’t
   help but hate the loneliness that will accompany me for the rest of my
   life.


   “Can I deny this fate and give it to someone else? And if I do, will
   there be someone to answer my call? Am I the only one who can achieve
   this end? I need to talk to someone, but no one but you believes me.”

   To be concluded tomorrow in [327]Part 2.
