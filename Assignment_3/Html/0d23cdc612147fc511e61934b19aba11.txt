      <em>Man is in no sense the sum total of what he has, but the totality of what he doesn't yet have, of what he could have.</em> – Jughead Penis-Arrest<br><br><em>Our bloody hands cling to splintery boards of outrageous flimsiness as we float, momentarily, upon a dark and chaotic ocean. . . . The human is compelled forth into an endless charade of nothing, until it ends.</em> – Thor Garcia<br><br><br>PRAGUE (CNS) – The cool, but dry, midnight air made him dizzy. He felt crazed, whacked. He was thoroughly boozy, yet it hadn’t eased the claustrophobia. It seemed like a mysterious layer in the sky was pressing down upon him.<br><br><em>What was going on?</em> He had no idea.<br><br>He decided to head down to Cherry Heaven. What else was left on Sunday night? What else should he do? It wasn’t that far. Maybe six blocks.<br><br>He’d long been intrigued – the neon bulbs and blinking lights, the crude paintings of palm trees on the marquee. . . .<br><br><em>More than 50 girls on every night!</em> Open until 5 a.m.<br><br>The walk made him cotton-mouthed. An icy beer would be nice, he imagined, for balance.<br><br>He had been out drinking with a pal. Four hours in a café – a <em>no smoking</em> café. He’d had to keep running out to the street, which was totally <em>bogus.</em><br><br>They finished the third bottle of Czech white and decided to call it a night. Bottles of Czech white had never really helped much.<br><br>Well, hell – nothing had ever helped much.<br><br>What had it all been about? He wasn’t sure. There had been no breakthrough. Had they actually discussed the history of <em>phlogiston</em>?<br><br>And what had he known about it, anyway? Nothing. That was the answer: <em>Nothing.</em> It had been just another fraudulent discussion – right, about the fraud of fraudulence.<br><br>He walked down the cement steps and pulled the grey-upholstered door. Cherry Heaven’s red-painted hallway was empty.<br><br>He trod along, his footsteps audible against the red carpet. He turned right and peered past the doorframe into the main lounge and stage area.<br><br><em>No naked girls at all!</em> Huh, how about that. <em>None.</em>So much for the famous brothels of Bohemia.<br><br>He saw a middle-aged woman, bleach-blond and fully-clothed, standing behind the bar in front of a wall mirror. She eyed him with indifference.<br><br>To the right, two pudgy guys with shaved heads sat at a table. They eyed him with suspicion.<br><br><em>Dicks,</em> he thought. <em>Fucking asshole cocks.</em><br><br>The guys were wearing white t-shirts and drinking coffee from small white cups. They had pudgy, play-doh arms.<br><br><em>Dicks</em>. Some kind of security guards, he figured. Maybe whore operators.<br><br>Maybe they’d beat him in an alley, he thought, casually. If so, it couldn’t be soon enough.<br><br>The two guys looked at him scornfully. <em>Assholes,</em> he thought. <em>Idiot little cock-suckers. Dicks.</em><br><br>He seethed. People were often so very <em>dickish.</em> What was wrong with them? Who needed this crap?<br><br>The woman called him over. It would be 180 crowns for the first beer, she said. Sorry, but that was the rule. After that, 100 each.<br><br>O.K., he said. He handed her 200.<br><br>He expected an icy, delicious draft in a tall glass. But no, oh no – she went to a fridge and returned with a small can of Gambrinus and an empty glass. She set both on the counter.<br><br>He shrugged. Well, he hadn’t come for the beer.<br><br>He sat at a table, cracked the can and poured it into a glass. The skinheads had disappeared. He took several long drinks from the aluminum.<br><br><em>Still no naked girls.</em><br><br>Something was wrong with the air, he thought. It was simultaneously too hot, but with a frigid shaft of breeze coming from an open window or somewhere. And the place smelled like wax and apple sauce. <em>Ugh.</em><br><br>Disco suddenly music screeched upon the speakers. Five or six TV screens on the walls flickered to life.<br><br>When the fuzz settled, different videos of hardcore porn were on the screens.<br><br>He lit a smoke and watched. There was little variation . All the shows seemed to involve dicks slipping in and out of innumerable female mouths and holes.<br><br>Mouths and holes. Mouths and holes.<br><br>He was largely unmoved. Such had the world evolved, that it was mere wallpaper at this point.<br><br>Porn, usually hardcore anal involving alleged teenage girls, was on all day at his house, for example. <em>All day. All night.</em> Well – what else would you suggest he watch?<br><br>Though, of course, if asked, he would more than capable of enunciating a lengthy list of the egregious cinematic shortcomings of such productions. Their humorless lack of self-awareness, their brazen failure to conjure any sense of genuine sensuality (generally), the ham-handed attempts at humiliation (e.g., testicles smushed on to the nose in an attempt to smother), the spiritual defeat represented by their unintended but absolute subservience to the socio-historical-economic quagmire of the militarized urban condition, which systematically obstructed aspirations for authentic human inter-relations. . . .<br><br>In Cherry Heaven, the videos continued to roll. He watched as the women swallowed, as they do. Swallowed everything the males could proffer. Swallowed and kept swallowing.<br><br>The men seemed ineffective, as they do. They pounded away, often three or four or five at once – several often working a particular hole in tandem – until finally they had exerted themselves to sweaty exhaustion.<br><br>The women opened up and took it, took it all, without objection or prejudice. With even a <em>ho-hum.</em><br><br>He finished his beer, squeezed the empty can in the middle, and drummed his knuckles on the table.<br><br>The video men continued to suffer and sweat and strain, thrusting everything they could muster into the female mouths and holes.<br><br>The men took hold of female heads, pulled back eyelids, shoved themselves as deep as possible into the wet mouths.<br><br><em>That’s right – that’s how you do it, boys! You all have obviously read the manual. . . .</em><br><br>The men slapped their penises vengefully against the female faces. They brought cocks down upon already semen-smeared noses. They fucked hair. Some even tried to penetrate ear holes.<br><br>The women were moved around like logs, stacked one upon the other, two and sometimes even three women high.<br><br>The men slapped female buttocks to redness. They slammed their penises into wet quivering holes.<br><br>Pretty soon, the video men were spent. One by one, they hobbled off-screen.<br><br>The women seemed unperturbed. They turned, opened mouths and holes, accepting yet another comer from extremely long lines of cocks.<br><br>He gazed about the room. <em>Still no naked girls!</em> Hmmm.<br><br>The bar woman came over, beholding him now with what appeared to be a vague hostility. He ordered two more beers. She brought them and he handed her another 200 kc bill.<br><br>He finished both in about 10 minutes. He got up to take a pee break. He wobbled down the hall and pushed the door. The bathroom was terribly dark.<br><br>He was a bit amazed to find that each urinal had a screen above it showing porn.<br><br>As his eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, he was almost completely amazed two find that each urinal also featured a white plexiglas covering that had been designed  to look like a woman's ass.<br><br>Cunt, asshole, everything.<br><br>Wow. <em>Wow</em>, he thought.<br><br>There’s someone out there who apparently thinks it's a turn-on to imagine that you are standing in the men's room at a brothel, watching porn as you piss into a woman's ass.<br><br>There might be thousands of these people out there, he thought. Probably millions. No – <em>no doubt,</em> millions.<br><br>Was the world simply an ugly place, with the human being constructing evermore cages in which to unleash his monstrosities upon himself?<br><br>Or did one merely have to endure the process of reconciling Freudian impulses with Jungian directives in order to, at long last, become fully integrated as an individual?<br><br>He zipped himself and returned to the lounge. The question, he surmised, would clearly require more alcohol and, hopefully, if it was at all possible, a nude female, to get to the bottom of.<br><br><strong>TO BE CONTINUED</strong><br><br><br><br><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5805766.Thor_Garcia">

      PRAGUE (CNS) - The sun mostly shined on the last day of school. All was well with Ukraine, the government-paid spokesmen dramatically maintained. A new era of “security and prosperity” was squarely in the offing, and richly deserved. The bosses ordered a quick retweet. One guy tore down my ceilings, a second guy put up the new ones. The first was all bovine shoulders and smoldering rage. Took him 40 minutes to blast those roofs to splinters. The second was a craftsman who had a large smile but sweated horrifically. He seemed about to die of a heart attack. For lunch, cold hot dogs from the plastic wrapper and a big-ass Studentská Pečeť, aw yeah. The Russians, whose wealth was wedded to obscurity and whose health was surely faltering, didn’t have insurance, so they were suing. The owner said he had nothing to do with it. I’m sure they’ll solve it eventually. The Russian guys, well shit - you come a long way baby from the days of the call girls and male escorts. Those little pretties standing by the front door and punching the buzzer. Wow, man, they’d get ‘em both in here for some crazy night, then complain about my noise! So much vodka their legs turned to jelly coming down the stairs. To see the permanently shriveled, scowling faces of their wives, you’d know these gents were skilled at the hard work. Maybe not so much anymore. Now they take several walks a day together, waddling slooooowly down the street with their mirror sunglasses and mustaches, just like a couple of sperm-basted Freddie Mercury imitators off the Castro. Doctors must have recommended it for their “health.” <em>Guilty Russkies Marooned in Prague: The Movie</em>, a film willingly seen by no one. Well, the flood certainly fucked with my place. Well, a lot of people were gripped in a delusional masturbatory fantasy, the leading theme of our age. Well, sometimes the condom don’t fit but you got to wear it. I talked to the Ukrainian at the bar, Oleg. He needed to shave his beard, it was all into his lips. He didn’t want to talk about it. He proposed himself as a mere guitar player, just into his art. Where’s your band, man? Well, it was coming together, wasn’t it? He conceded Crimea to the Russkies, but “Ukraine is real people, not fake.” I know, that’s what they all say. But there’s no more place more Russian than Kiev, or is there? What about the Blackwater snipers? That was some crucial work, and nicely done. “Bloody splendid!” said my English companion. The bearded Italian, damn he was pudgy, ran up and said Iron Maiden had changed his life. He had no regrets - was <em>not</em> looking back. He claimed that on <em>A Real Live One</em>, one of the tracks was recorded in Milano. Well, I was happy, but who could give a flying. The cops had all our information. It was only a matter of time before everyone but the dicks was crucified, wings torn off, and then they’d come for the dicks, too, an finally the chicks with dicks. I didn’t know what was happening, the wave had been pounding for years now and I was just rolling and it was just this thing that would not stop and I didn't care to stop it. It had turned into four days at Angelique’s. How did it become 11 a.m.? Where had we been the night before? I hadn’t even bothered to pole-weave with all the lousy crutons who were looking for a sniff up her ass. It’s not worth it if you have to fight for it. Angelique insisted I sit naked in her love seat, even when my cock had shrunk to size two. You couldn’t call mine much of a stunt cock, though it surely pulled off a few tricks. “I’ve got a cold can of Staropramen,” she said, and poured into a glass. <em>One can.</em> She wasn’t a booze-all-night type, mainly a water sipper and pills fanatic, dropping the names of deejays. Not sure on who Tom Waits might be, but thinks she heard Nick Cave is pretty cool. She had a reputation as a hard body, but really it was just soft mush with a carefully layered landing strip. She never worked out, claimed it was just walking and yogurt. She was still lucking out on the natural curves, but I couldn’t see it lasting much longer. Not a roll-over-in-the-morning-and-start-to-blow type, she’d have to start being better at the oral if she wanted a real banger in this life. Right, and she sixty-nined without much originality, let alone joy. Although I could see her doing anal at least once, no, it wouldn’t end up be something she thrived on. That said, she clearly had doggied previously, at some length and with some expertise, she knew how to ride and writhe it. On top of that, she’d said my come had a “chewy” consistency and tasted “spicy.” That’s what they all say, baby. Well, I was largely agnostic, it was another one with nowhere to go to spiral sideways and then down. We had a laugh about nothing. I kissed her nipples and fingered the books on her table. “Uhhh, Philip Roth and John Updike? They totally suck, you must hate herself and want to die. Next you’ll probably tell me you’ve got a signed Jonathan Franzden.” She laughed. “What are you calling your next book?” “I don’t know, baby. Maybe <em>Face in the Dirt / Ass in the Wind: An Undiscovered Gravity.</em>.” "Sounds good!" "Oh, you bet."<br><br><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5805766.Thor_Garcia">

      <em>Glancing up, I witnessed Dina crawling, hair turbaned in a towel, tits nearly dragging along the old wooden planks. The vision brought with it the realization that the degree of conjugacy of a conjugate point measured by the index and degree of degeneracy of the form measured by its corank amounted to the same thing. Degeneracy and degrees of freedom related. It seemed just. Still, it pissed me off that he’d dragged me into conjugate points with dreary shit using determinants, a clunky foray into discontinuous vector fields that seemed unnecessary . . .

I trust this marvelous June day finds you hearty and seething. . . . I understand you recently received an advance copy of Jim Chaffee’s new novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Dream-Studies-Mathematical-Pornography/dp/1926617231/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401246522&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=Jim+Chaffee" rel="nofollow"> <strong><em>American Dream: Studies in Mathematical Pornography</em></strong></a>. What’s your immediate impression?</strong><br><br>A: Well, thank you, Jakob. First off, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Dream-Studies-Mathematical-Pornography/dp/1926617231/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401246522&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=Jim+Chaffee" rel="nofollow"> <strong><em>American Dream</em></strong></a> is nothing less than a horrifying, hilarious, soul-sucking, psychedelic experience of excruciating, unforgettable intensity. It’s got sadness and aggression, hatred and defiance, something wicked and druggy and ineffable, draped all over it. But above all, sadness, hilarity, cocks, mathematics, and gaping assholes. It also may be one of the greatest jokes of our time. I may never be sure. That’s the magic. I mean, this is a book where heaving monster cocks, many of them black, are constantly exploding vinegary cock-juice into the mouths of willing babes whose assholes, lest you doubt, are well agape after a furious fucking. Then there is a discussion – often angry and bitter, it seems, and lasting for pages – about mathematical formulae that are surely incomprehensible to the lay reader. This is just some of what Jim Chaffee has given us in the masterpiece he has chosen to call <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Dream-Studies-Mathematical-Pornography/dp/1926617231/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401246522&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=Jim+Chaffee" rel="nofollow"> <strong><em>American Dream: Studies in Mathematical Pornography</em></strong></a><br><br><br><strong>Surely –</strong><br><br>Yes, at least according the rules most of us observe now, or would testify that we do. But that’s not all, Jakob. I must emphasize – in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Dream-Studies-Mathematical-Pornography/dp/1926617231/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401246522&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=Jim+Chaffee" rel="nofollow"> <strong><em>American Dream</em></strong></a>, a profound mathematical exploration of prodigious philosophical dimensions seems to be occurring on almost every page. It’s quite disorienting. Mathematical theorems and conceits are continually exposed, dissected, celebrated and tossed aside, mostly without remorse. And then, without skipping a beat, someone is again being reamed by a black cock of inestimable length and girth. As you know, I’m not really capable of discussing the intense math in any detail . . . but the cocks and wide open cunts that Jim Chaffee brings to the fore are quite another matter. Basically, with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Dream-Studies-Mathematical-Pornography/dp/1926617231/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401246522&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=Jim+Chaffee" rel="nofollow"> <strong><em>American Dream</em></strong></a> Jim Chaffee has stroked and stroked and launched a cruel, blinding, unflinching come-blast into the eye of literature. The effect is dizzying and warping, nauseating and crippling. It resists description. It’s just plain fucked up. I’ve read nothing like it before. It’s a tremendous, epic achievement, one that rightly should inspire fear and longing.<br><br><strong>But –</strong><br><br>What I’m saying, Jakob, is that this is a book that will fuck with your head. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Dream-Studies-Mathematical-Pornography/dp/1926617231/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401246522&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=Jim+Chaffee" rel="nofollow"> <strong><em>American Dream</em></strong></a> is likely to be the least reassuring thing you will read this decade, perhaps in your lifetime. This is a book that, possibly, may give you clues about finding your place in the cosmos, if you think about it hard enough. But your conclusions will not be reassuring, of that I can assure you. At the same time, it must also be seen as a highly sentimental work – in the sense, however, that you might be sentimental about a whore’s anus that you once loved and defiled, and witnessed being defiled in a gangbang. Yes, it is that tremendous. And what we can say without qualification is that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Dream-Studies-Mathematical-Pornography/dp/1926617231/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401246522&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=Jim+Chaffee" rel="nofollow"> <strong><em>American Dream</em></strong></a> puts to shame anybody who’s lately tried to be a literary bad boy, and there are many of them out there, as you well know. . . . Also, it’s a merciless heartbreaker. You will not easily rise from the dead after <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Dream-Studies-Mathematical-Pornography/dp/1926617231/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401246522&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=Jim+Chaffee" rel="nofollow"> <strong><em>American Dream</em></strong></a>. In fact, you may die. If you don’t come close to dying during the reading of this book, you’re probably already dead. Make no mistake: Jim Chaffee is a literary bad man who has come to your house to mouth-fuck your wife and scrawl mathematical equations on your kitchen table and bathroom mirror, debunking all your closely held theories. He will simultaneously be having a second orgasm and a Vietnam War flashback. In sum, it’s an affront to everything we pretend to hold dear, or have tried to ignore in our greed and sloth. The tender reader, I fear, will be rendered unusable under the onslaught that is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Dream-Studies-Mathematical-Pornography/dp/1926617231/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401246522&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=Jim+Chaffee" rel="nofollow"> <strong><em>American Dream</em></strong></a>. And thank heavens. A book like this is a gift. We must clutch it tightly to our chests.<br><br><strong>Fascinating. Tell me, Thor –</strong><br><br>Well, Jakob, I felt myself going queasy and unhinged from the opening pages. A totally involuntary reaction. The first night I spent with it, I ending up smashing a champagne bottle against the wall and falling asleep with my face in an ashtray. I woke up trembling the next day, spooked, embarrassed over some of the things I seemed to have been <em>thinking</em> while under the influence of those first 200 pages. . . . It starts off, predictably enough, with a claustrophobic scene involving a pathetic family and a dying mother. There’s a suggestion that they've all gone batty because of religion and the tragedy of the American illusion, and also because they’re weak and tired and their brains never worked so good. We’ve all been there, certainly, but believe me – there’s nothing cute here. Chaffee stomps his boot on the windpipe from the get-go – he’s none too happy with these folks. He’s gone ahead and outlawed sunshine. . . .<br><br><strong>Are you suggesting –</strong><br><br>No, no. What I’m saying is, the main character seems clearly pissed off – about everything, really. And you’re waiting for him to get started. But again, there’s nothing cute about it – Chaffee makes no attempt to give him attributes that might make you sympathetic to him. It’s a shutout. Instead, we see this guy smoking hash and babbling about Riemannian manifolds and so forth, but in a totally asshole and condescending way. You have no idea what he’s talking about, but he acts like you should, like, right – you should know <em>exactly</em> what he means as he rambles on about diluting his hash and Cauchy-Riemann equations. It’s a staggering combination of arrogance and madness, but totally lucid. You’re thinking – this guy’s a real prick, come on, man, what’s next. . . . Well, sure enough, without much explanation, the next thing you know he’s drinking and having a threesome with a couple of nymphomaniacs named Lori and Millie. It seems perfectly natural. It’s just what this guy does. He just knows a lot of freaky chicks, apparently. In this passage, there’s a delightful description of an extremely hairy asshole. One of the chicks begs Whitey to screw the other in her “hairy sphincter” while the two girls get down sixty-nine style. Whitey obliges, without much comment. Everybody’s moaning and tonguing clits and coming and slurping semen. It’s a wonderful scene, one of many descriptive summits achieved by Chaffee.<br><br><strong>But – </strong><br><br>Yes . . . so in any event, things continue along. We find Whitey talking about Cantor’s theory of transfinite numbers, and he’s snorting coke and doing drug deals and name-dropping Ferdinand Georg Frobenius, and there’s packs of homos wandering about in the New Orleans haze, and sleazeballs and strange women and suspicious dudes cropping up everywhere, and they’re eating disgusting food and talking darkly and vaguely about unfortunate things that happened or could happen. Good stuff. . . . Also, it turns out Whitey’s got a leg injury from the Vietnam War, which sometimes causes him serious pain, if not total distraction. The crime and loss of the Vietnam War is very much a part of things in this book, indeed it’s the precipice that the whole thing is built on. But to Chaffee’s immense credit, it’s far, far from a “Vietnam book,” as least as we’ve been trained to understand such beasts. Vietnam is mainly the ignored, unwanted spectral guest in the room, but there’s no ignoring the stink it gives off. . . . Anyway, and maybe, you know, Whitey’s got a big, ugly dick. Well, it seems like he might. . . .<br><br><strong>What the fuck are you talking about? Who is this “Whitey”? That’s a very provocative name, isn’t it?</strong><br><br>Is it? Yes, absolutely. That would be the superhero, or perhaps just math-anal superstar, of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Dream-Studies-Mathematical-Pornography/dp/1926617231/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401246522&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=Jim+Chaffee" rel="nofollow"> <strong><em>American Dream</em></strong></a> – Whitey Butcher. Whitey repeatedly drops suggestions that he’s a true bad-ass, but the braggadocio mostly seems half-hearted, not completely persuasive. Whitey’s cagey, he never seems to reveal exactly who he is, at least not in the conventional way of most books – most of which, we must admit, are quite bad. Whitey does inform that he was teenage delinquent, and that he went on to fuck a married woman in junkyards and on the side of the road and in skuzzy hotel rooms. . . . In any case, then he signed up for Vietnam. The military liked his bad attitude and fighting spirit – <em>now here’s a lost, unfeeling bastard we can really chew up</em>. . . . Whitey comes off as a somewhat arrogant, immoral character who seems to have a nuclear-level rage burning just below the surface. You worry what might happen if he could ever force himself to give much of a damn. But that’s one of his strengths – he never seems to lose his cool, no matter how much crazy shit is going down. He seems to have a resigned indifference to just about everything – a far-out <em>distance</em> from what’s occurring right in front of him. . . . As I say, he’s not easy to like, and you never find yourself rooting for him. But he’s also not the kind of guy who would give much of a damn about whether you like him or not. Whitey seems to have achieved some kind of mental or philosophical breakthrough that allows him to use this ingrained aloofness to his advantage. At the same time, he never quite gets around to saying exactly what’s happened that’s made him this way – dick-swinging chick magnet, jaded pervert, and mathematical fiend. His narcissism is operating on an altogether different level. For all the freaky scenes he indulges in, all the hot whores who are constantly munching his balls, his intellectual triumphs over everyone he encounters – Whitey never seems too impressed with himself or anybody else. He’s not captive to the same egomania that fucks with other people’s brains. His nonchalance, I must say, is more than a little uncomfortable – it adds to the sense of horror and depraved unreality of this deeply unsettling book. Whether Whitey’s shooting his load into some slut’s mouth, getting his ass rimmed, doing coke and slugging cocktails, hanging out with folks who fuck dogs and make bestiality movies – it doesn’t seem all that much of a big deal to him. You get the idea he could take or leave it. . . .<br><br><strong>And yet. . . .</strong><br><br>Right. But let him get started talking about the math – oh, dear. This guy is a whiz at the complicated math. He thrives on it, even more than he thrives on sticking his dick in an anal whore. Whitey can talk the math talk for pages and pages. See, if it’s not about the hardcore math science, it’s total bull to Whitey. He just ain’t interested. Whitey’s got a few things to say about economics and what he regards as the other fraudulent sciences. But what really seems to get Whitey off is ass-fucking and sex-slaving to ruminations on the Smoluchowski Equation. . . . Anyway, it’s spectacular. Suddenly Whitey will shift out of the math and there he goes, ramming his dick in another chick’s ass. Or maybe he’ll be watching some black guy called “Mule” perform the service with a cock the size of a fire hose.<br><br><strong>But, surely –</strong><br><br>Exactly, Marc-Jakob. This book, as I say, if it has nothing else, has really got a great number of gigantic black cocks pumping and pumping away in every orifice a woman can possibly offer. Girls are constantly begging for black cock, and sucking and getting fucked in the ass by gigantic black dicks, and indeed, hoping to be impregnated by black cocks. “Whitey,” of course, digs it – it’s absolutely tremendous, delicious. <em>Somebody stop him, Jim!</em> – but no, sir. Chaffee slays again, another black cock straight through to the abdomen. I remember one passage in particular – “Nigger dick is best,” says a “carpeted bush.” Yes, it’s a phenomenal exploration of this classic Americanism, this white male fear/desire. Fans of black cocks – and as you know – as you well know – we can confirm there are a great many in this world – will be extremely gratified with what Chaffee has cooked up in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Dream-Studies-Mathematical-Pornography/dp/1926617231/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401246522&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=Jim+Chaffee" rel="nofollow"> <strong><em>American Dream</em></strong></a>. . . . In sum, then: Whitey Butcher fought the gooks, got fucked over while fighting the gooks, fucked lots of whores in the ass, mastered the math, took all the drugs, and apparently became a millionaire. And in the end, he didn’t amount to anything.<br><br><strong>Before we go on – for the record, Thor, do you know Jim Chaffee?</strong><br><br>I’ve never met him, no. . . . But he was one of the first on the internet to publish one of my stories, on his Drill Press site, <em>The Big Stupid Review</em>, which I highly recommend everyone take a look at. You can get some clues about what Jim Chaffee’s thinking about by examining the Drill Press. It was very inspiring for me. His earlier novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sao-Paulo-Blues-James-Chaffee/dp/1926617215/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1402328855&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Jim+Chaffee+sao+paulo" rel="nofollow"> <strong><em>Sao Paulo Blues</em></strong></a>, is also an outstanding work and is widely recommended. About stuff the American expatriates get up to in Brazil.<br><br><strong>What would you – </strong><br><br>Anyway, Jakob, through no real fault of his own, Whitey eventually winds up with this fantastic, lovely, disgusting pig of a girl named Dina. They cut a deal and Whitey chains her up in a New Orleans hovel. Dina’s a brilliantly pretentious, if misguided, intellectual whore – and a cock-craving slut of the very highest order. As if you had any doubt. In fact, for some time Dina made her living fucking dogs for the merriment of rich people. She became well-acquainted with the finer points of male canine genitalia, and some of those details will certainly be an eye-opener for many readers.<br><br><strong>But, in what sense – </strong><br><br><em>Of course</em> she is, Jakob. What did you expect? And yes, it makes perfect sense. Dina is soon outfitted with a leather mask and forced to crawl around on her hands and knees, drinking and eating from a dog bowl. When he’s not ejaculating all over her, which is early and often, Whitey is more than content to watch her get mouth-fucked and gangbanged by a crew of skuzzy dopers and skunks who he sometimes hangs around with for illegal purposes. . . . And Dina’s perfectly happy – the story makes clear that her goal in life is to be abused and dominated, to be an anal fuck slave – to <em>agree</em> to be a slave, at any rate. It’s her choice, you see, and we should respect and honor it – and I do. There’s a keen passage where Dina explains that she’s tired of men who want her be a filthy anal slut when she’s in bed with <em>them</em> . . . but a prim and sexless housewife in her encounters with men in the outside world. This chick, man, no way – Dina wants to be an anal slut <em>all</em> the time. She’s hooked on the thrill. She craves losing her moorings, her sense of identity, her fears and sadness, by allowing men to indulge their most savage fantasies and agonies by ravaging her body to their heart’s momentary satisfaction. It’s her passion, her game, her power.<br><br><strong>Would you say –</strong><br><br>No. But what I can say, Jakob, is that Dina insists on calling Whitey “sir,” at all times. And when they are not fucking, sucking and ejaculating, they are often fond of preening pompously together while pontificating about white-male domination and Benjamin Lee Whorf. And so on. And so there is this imaginary depth that they play at. . . I’m going to say that this girl, Dina – you can see her as the true hero of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Dream-Studies-Mathematical-Pornography/dp/1926617231/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401246522&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=Jim+Chaffee" rel="nofollow"> <strong><em>American Dream</em></strong></a>, if we believe there is such a thing. She gives of her body and soul in order to soothe and worship Whitey, to make him feel desired and in control. No matter how callously and squalidly he treats her, no matter how often he whores her out, no matter how often she’s humiliated, she only insists that she craves more. In this way, she stays true to herself – devoted, disciplined, and dignified, no matter how much splooge from strange men might be streaming from her nostrils. In any event, she is eventually purchased from Whitey for $2 million. Whitey pockets the money and shrugs. No doubt, many tender and humorless readers will find something contemptible in all of this, along with many other frightful aspects of this book. Again, Jakob – Jim Chaffee deserves many congratulations for his achievement. We must stand up and applaud.<br><br><strong>What do you think –</strong><br><br>Well, I don’t know, Jakob. Yes, indeed, there are times it all seems like a gargantuan joke – and I’m not sure who it might be on. The math, or the study of what you might call ideal constructions, adds to the unreality, the separation from the world of ordinary concerns. Perhaps it’s the logic-based parameter that emphasizes Chaffee’s idealized world of insatiable sluts and endlessly splooging penises. For those not competent in the math, it ends up being like poetry from another planet, an alien language. You let it flow over you, enjoying the sensuality of the terms, mysterious equations and names. You can imagine that the math is some kind of madman’s insanity – which works as a proposition on its own – or you can assume that Chaffee knows a little something of what he’s talking about – that in some way, he’s laying waste to faulty structures, lowering much-needed booms on the frauds of the Math Wars . . . all with a sadistic, sybaritic grin on his face. If you can cross that threshold, it takes on its own poetic surrealism. And then, without fail, we’re back to the ass-fucking. Chaffee is a man who seems to love his algebra and his assholes in equal measure. There’s no other way to put it. He deserves many prizes, on both the U.S. and international stages. <strong>American Dream</strong> should be made into an NC-17 feature film, as directed by the members of Throbbing Gristle or GWAR.<br><br><strong>But how –</strong><br><br>Jesus, Jakob – how many times do I have to say it? It’s the cocks, the cocks, the <em>cocks!</em> Misshapen white cocks, flaccid and bendy cocks, black cocks as long as elephant trunks and thick as giraffe necks. In the end, Chaffee makes the totally legitimate point that all women want to get hosed, indeed to get impregnated, by black dudes with long schlongs. . . Personally, I counted more than 400 uses of cock, dick or penis throughout the book, which averages to about one every page and a half. . . . There’s also a curious case where a girl has “a clitoris the size of a baby’s fist shaped like a glans penis but without shaft or meatus.” And in answer to your question, Jakob – the answer is no. . . . Chaffee turns out to be a very cruel and vicious writer, which makes him, by definition, a very funny one as well. As one character says: “All reality is local. Worse, you cannot be sure what is the imaginary. Or the power of the types. In an unstable theory, not all types are definable. Indiscernible is one thing, indefinable another entirely. You can’t be sure – these models are not homogeneous – you can’t be sure where you end up with what. Elementals can be imaginary or maybe you can be imaginary or both. What is eliminated?” To which Whitey responds: “You sound like a witch.” It rarely gets better, anywhere, in any country or time.<br><br><strong>Is there any – </strong><br><br>No – the human spirit, as you well know, Jakob, is <em>not</em> noble. That is an idiotic myth. No, Jim Chaffee has created nothing less than a soul-trampling work of genius and rampant anal sex, chock-filled with all manner of druggy sloth, blasted personalities, decayed spirits and sheer far-outness. It’s a masterpiece for the math geek and anal pervert in all of us. But it’s a tear-jerker, too, and a dick-jerker. . . A heavy, hideous shadow of unrequited loss lays across its brow. Chafee goes further in sincerity, confusion, obscenity, and brutal and joyful provocation than just about anybody I’ve ever read. What I am trying to say is – well, truly, it made me question just what the fuck are people doing with their books, including myself. Why are they bothering? And that's a great thing for Jim Chaffee to have accomplished. This is a book where men may go to die.<br><br><strong>Thank you, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thor-Garcia/e/B0084M5416" rel="nofollow"> <strong>Thor Garcia</strong></a>.</strong><br><br>Thank you, Marc-Jakob.<br><br><br><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5805766.Thor_Garcia">

  <div class="body mediumText reviewText">
      <strong>Interview by Vít Bohal</strong>, from the <a href="http://equuspress.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/blood-love-conspiracy/" rel="nofollow">Equus Press website</a><br><br><br><strong>PRAGUE </strong> – Whether working nights for 17 years in a suffocating office of corporate pirates on Wecenslas Square, or playing Prague clubs with his punk band <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeI2wqBzRgHlwhJ4l54eIZQ" rel="nofollow"><strong>FACE TIGERS</strong></a>, </em> (check them on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeI2wqBzRgHlwhJ4l54eIZQ" rel="nofollow">Tube</a>), California-born Thor Garcia always seems to be in a rush and on the move. Much like the narrator of his novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-News-Clown-Novel-Garcia-ebook/dp/B00DE11UKQ" rel="nofollow">
  <em>
    <strong>The News Clown</strong>
  </em>
</a> (2012), Thor is always one step ahead of the game, slinking through the underbelly of Prague’s bars and ex-pat clubs, getting the skinny, and leaving the niceties for scraps.<br><br>It’s been a full year since Thor’s last book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Only-Fools-Die-Heartbreak-Stories-ebook/dp/B00DDZRPQG/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401563078&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=thor+garcia+only+fools+heartbreak" rel="nofollow">
  <em>
    <strong>Only Fools Die of Heartbreak</strong>
  </em>
</a> (2013), came out, and so it is high time we checked to see what he has been up to these past months. We got back to talking about <em>
  <strong>The News Clown</strong>
</em>, a wallop of a novel which gives the contemporary US-of-A the third degree. The narrator is all but pleased with the state of things, and the whole book resonates with deep scorn for the social situation in the Land of the Free. The narrative never becomes self-conscious, however, and the treatment of the American reality – and all the little foibles and larger blemishes indulged in by the American populace – rings true throughout. The text offers a dystopian vision of completely pedestrian proportions. The end of the world is no longer nigh; it is here, alive and well, walking the streets, and eating at Taco Town. Brace for the ride, because it is all heat-death from now on.<br><br><strong>The protagonist of your novel <em>The News Clown</em> is a young reporter trying to make it big in Bay City, USA. You are and have been a reporter yourself. How’s that going?</strong><br><br>THOR GARCIA: Well, good, thanks. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-News-Clown-Novel-Garcia-ebook/dp/B00DE11UKQ" rel="nofollow">
  <em>The News Clown</em>
</a>  is about a “legman,” a guy who works for a small wire service. For most of the book, he covers crime and municipal mayhem, murders and fires and drug busts, stuff like this. Later, he moves on to cover the courts, which is its own kind of killing and muck. I did that for years as a reporter in California, north and the south. The guy in the book was basically taking dictation from the cops and authorities, which is mostly what I did and what most reporters do. They are simply stenographers for the police state.<br><br><strong>Hmmm. In what way?</strong><br><br>What I mean is, reporters suck the teat. We suck the cock. Reporters are cocksuckers. At the same time, most of them imagine themselves to be brilliant literary cocksmen. They’ve got a romantic obsession with literature for the usual fucked up reasons. Most of them, unless they’re CIA or FBI agents or some shit like that – and there are many of these working in professional news rooms, by the way – want to be book writers but they need the money. They figure journalism’s kind of close to literature, because of the propaganda. It ruins 99.9 per cent of them, just like 99.9 per cent of all people are ruined by whatever they do. These would-be writers would be better off washing dishes and living that life, instead of fooling around with the nasty-ass, lying chimera called news. At least they might do an honest day’s work. News is a job for frustrated writers and whack-offs and people who think they should be television stars. And for FBI and CIA agents. I think the lies that surround the myth of journalism, and the shame that accompanies it, are shown fairly clearly in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-News-Clown-Novel-Garcia-ebook/dp/B00DE11UKQ" rel="nofollow">
  <em>The News Clown</em>
</a>. We see the sham behind this young man’s illusions.<br><br><strong>What was your motivation when you decided to do <em>The News Clown</em>?</strong><br><br>Well, I had all these stories in my head about my experiences as a reporter. That was the initial idea, to explore the life of a young reporter, his work, along with his personal life, his family. But by the time I really got going – I started in early 2001, and finished the first draft at the end of 2007 – the world was suddenly going through an extraordinary, terrifying upheaval. There was September 11, 2001, the greatest day in world history – a surreal glimpse of the unreal that still seems totally dreamlike and balls-out awesome . . . .<br><br>And each day after that only seemed to bring some new intensifying horror, some shocking threat, some new over-the-top outrage and mind-melter - things that just months before we would have thought not only improbable, but impossible. . . . In retrospect, everything makes perfect sense, except for the unreality of the 9/11 attacks themselves. So what we had was the extraordinary piling on the extraordinary, and rapidly. Nobody could keep pace. Everybody seemed to be losing their minds. Politicians and pundits were foaming at the mouth, blubbering and conjuring spirits and wanting to see the bodies stacked. The U.S.A. went into war mode, destroying entire Iraqi cities, attaching electrodes to Arab cocks, setting up secret prisons and enjoying the taste of torture. Civil liberties were being dismantled by Congress and the president without a second thought. The U.S. Constitution was being shredded on a daily basis. . . . And most folks applauded, so great was the fear. People would go on television and talk about how it easy it would be for the terrorists to destroy America with a few nuclear bombs that they could steal from Pakistan or somewhere. Good friends of mine – whom at that time I considered intelligent and relatively liberal, fair-minded and freedom-loving – went on the internet and wrote hateful diatribes against Arab culture, blasting the Arabs for not having a space program. This guy argued that that’s why they hated us – because we could go in space and they couldn’t, along with the usual mish-mash. And because the Arabs couldn’t go in space, they were a crap culture and deserved everything America was going to serve them. Shit like this. Not a joke. My eyeballs couldn’t get any wider. But it was everywhere. You would have conversations with people in bars about how they really, really wanted to nuke the whole Middle East and South Asia. Or, conversely, a different sort of person would talk about how the tension and fear was killing them and they secretly hoped the terrorists would do something awful to put us out of our misery. I talked to some folks who would propose both ideas within minutes.<br><br>In any case, the U.S.A., and the rest of the world along with it, was rapidly morphing into a new horrible monster. The future had suddenly arrived, and it was going to be a bloody dystopia, a religious war and a police state. And the big message was, you better sign up with America, because if anybody wins this shit-fest, it’s going to be good ol’ U.S.A. No matter what happens, don’t worry, we’ll still have some pretty good TV shows and interesting fast-food tacos. Crash of the drums. . . . Anyway, having the narrator be a reporter seemed like a good way of getting at some of the stuff that was going on. It offered a lot of openings.<br><br><strong>Has the situation evolved since those days?</strong><br><br>Well, who knows where we are now. I have no idea. Have the terrorists run out of gas? Did the terrorists even exist? What we do know now is that a very repressive and controlling culture of masturbation and surveillance has appeared on the internet, and a great many people appear addicted to these so-called social networking sites. That wasn’t really the case yet when I was writing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-News-Clown-Novel-Garcia-ebook/dp/B00DE11UKQ" rel="nofollow">
  <em>The News Clown</em>
</a>, it was still in its infancy. But what has happened is that we now see people humiliating and cheapening themselves in public, on a massive scale, and they apparently think it’s cool. It’s very bizarre to me. It’s been demonstrated that the internet is impoverishing people, and causing them to shame and soil themselves, and spying on everyone – and there’s a majority who will still tell you it’s freedom like we’ve never experienced.<br><br><strong>Yes, you often hear that the internet is solely a source of freedom, no strings attached.</strong><br><br>Yeah. But maybe the idea is sinking through, finally, that the idea of the internet as “freedom” was a gigantic whopper told by those few who profit from it and who implanted the system for their greedy, nefarious ends. Quite a few of my close friends were controlled early by the internet phenomenon, they believed the propaganda. Many were the times that I was the last, and extremely unpopular, guy saying it was all a sinister control program that would destroy everything we most valued, such as vinyl record albums by Supertramp and dog-eared paperbacks by Joseph Heller. . . . . What happened to a great many college-educated folk of my acquaintance was that they imagined the internet represented an easy answer to hard, fundamentally difficult, economic and social problems, and they signed up without a blink. To toot my own horn, I argued – again, often and early – that there was nothing that would stop this system from being used by the authorities and corporations for enslavement goals. I mean, wasn’t it obvious? It seemed obvious to me, but people insisted I was just being a contrarian, and why couldn’t I just be quiet and join the groovy team? <em>China will be free! The internet will take down the Russians and the Iranians and the Saudis!</em> It did no such thing, of course, not even close. In fact, you could argue it only enhanced the power of those regimes, just as it has enhanced the power of the U.S. authorities. . . . So when we see now that the internet is just a tremendous spying and manipulation machine, and doesn’t really offer that much in terms of genuine value, I do feel a sense of vindication.<br><br><strong>Considering that the NSA was unmasked for the spying behemoth that it is, it turns out you were kind of right. Where do you think we’re heading with the internet?</strong><br><br>What we will see, I think, is the gradual control of nearly all internet content by the state and corporations. They will squeeze out, or find ways to limit, access to all the things they don’t like. You’ll still be able to find, in most cases, what you’re looking for. But it won’t be as easy and it will be marginalized, ghettoized. The internet will basically be just another profit stream for Disney and Dickflix or whatever, these homogenized giants. It’s already happening – and you know what? Maybe it’s what most people want. Maybe most people want that stability, that false sense of security, the guarantee of a certain safe quality that these gigantic outfits provide. . . . But in real terms, my position is that the internet has given very, very little real help to people. In fact, it’s amplified the worst aspects of people and decreased our freedom and security. Thanks to the internet, we are much more exposed and at risk. This thing is diminishing our society and civilization. It’s very destabilizing to be aware that authorities, whether government or corporate or criminal, are peeking at your emails and your internet activities, compiling databases. To realize that your online activity, or activities merely associated with your accounts, will probably become part of police files and that they will be looked at during police checks. In terms of technology, the screwdriver has given us so much more. The internet’s been a big flop. I think we’d do just fine without it. But, you know, that’s just saying nothing. And I realize that.<br><br><strong>What’s happened on the political side of things?</strong><br><br>Well, it’s pretty clear now that we are governed by a police state in the West. All the tools and machinery are in place. Most folks are still in massive denial – I hear it all the time, at work and elsewhere – “Hey man, what’s the problem? I’ve got nothing to hide. Who cares if they look?” O.K., sure, pal. Rock on. But I guess what’s freaking me out is that – and they make no secret of this – all the so-called “human rights” of the U.S.A. and the European Union have actually become completely conditional. Unseen authorities will in fact decide if you are deserving of protections. The U.S. government, for example, has admitted it carried out the drone murder of an American citizen without anything resembling due process. This man, an alleged terrorist, was executed and he hadn’t even been indicted. His teenage American son was also killed by a separate drone hit. These murders happened in Yemen, and the government claimed it in fact had the legal right to take this alleged American terrorist out - just blast him remotely from the sky - for alleged links to Al-Qaeda terrorism. I don't think they even bothered to release any alleged evidence of wrongdoing. They just called him a terrorist and that was it, and bombed his young son as well. . . . . Anyway, these drone executions violated the whole concept of U.S. rights and law - at least as they used to be understood - but nobody in America raised much of a peep. So it’s pretty clear now that if they don’t like you for some reason, they have every tool imaginable to hunt you down and wipe you out or throw you behind bars. End of story. They can disappear you, or hit you with a drone missile. . . . What happens next? I don’t know. I expect it will involve cracking down on people for their alleged political views, as based on the websites they visit, things like this. It will be new methods, but the same oppressive results. . . . Targeted individuals, for example, might find that their bank accounts have disappeared without a trace. Or they will be mysteriously blocked from using certain internet services or websites. Or they will see that a new identity, with certain true facts about their history included, has been created for them on the internet. Or they won’t be able to buy airline or Disneyland tickets. Their options will be restricted. The system now in place is built to detect enemies and to liquidate them –to do what’s necessary to protect the vested, on-board interests. And this, I think, is what the system shall do. The system will crush the enemies of the United States, Europe, Japan, China and Colombia - as inscrutably defined by unseen authorities - and it will get more and more powerful in the foreseeable future.<br><br><strong>What do these powers in the higher echelon of politics hope to achieve, though? What are they hoping to get out of it?</strong><br><br>Money and power – the same old things that have always motivated and ruined people; power unleashed in pursuit of money and more power. The techniques have evolved, but the song remains the same. Stomp the weak. Make ordinary people virtual slaves. Central governments, big institutions, are very strong now and they will do what it takes to defend their position. Everything, all the wars and control systems and manipulation, the financial crises, arise from this, logically and with little deviation. There’s lots of money to be made in war, of course, lots of cash to be made in a financial crisis. Lots of cash in implementing control systems. These are cycles that continually generate cash for whoever’s in a position to profit. The powers have a lot invested in the system, and they’re not going to give it up easily. I mean, Jesus, the dominant human instinct is to take, not to give, not to surrender power. So what would you expect? Also, these folks are shape-shifting lizards from another planet. . . . In any case, the ordinary person usually winds up confused, which is the plan. You listen to ordinary Joe and Joanie and they merely repeat the contradictory mishmash of political talking points, the dimwitted line of the day, purveyed by whatever outlet they watch or read. And most people are working so hard to get by, really running the treadmill, that they’re usually too exhausted to think critically. As Upton Sinclair said, and famously: “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.” Not that Joe and Joanie would behave any differently if suddenly they wound up in charge. They’d be just as greedy and controlling and vicious as the folks who are on top now. Anyway, the result is paralysis, leading to the death of the mind and half-hearted support for the status quo. Mission accomplished.<br><br><strong>That’s some pretty far out stuff. Is there anything to be done?</strong><br><br>No, I don’t think so. There’s little hope, in fact, none. Everything’s futile. Nothing will have an impact. Why do women have holes? Why do men have dicks? Why do people say it doesn’t matter? Earth is clearly hell. Humanity’s got too many glitches in the wiring. We’ll never overcome our weaknesses – it’s just not possible. We are not smart or disciplined enough. We simply have to wait for the next cataclysm. And even that won’t help much. All we can do is kick back and watch the show, have a drink, if we’re lucky and smart enough.<br><br><strong>The writing style of <em>The News Clown</em> is concise, very crisp and efficient. Do you find that a long-winded style can still be attractive to the modern reader?</strong><br><br>Well, it’s not attractive to me. But yes, it does seem to be attractive to many. There’s a lot of long-winded stuff out there – in fact, that’s mostly what you see if you delve into the lit world. For quite some time there’s been an epidemic of these people who bludgeon you with unceasingly ironic, over-worded sentences about their precious feelings and the special times they imagined they had, and isn’t it so tragic and fantastic? There’s this faulty idea that many writers have, usually young ones, that you should overpower the reader by launching fusillades of adjectives and compound modifiers at them as a means of proving that your alleged experiences were truly soul-searing and that your brilliance should be revered, locally and globally. I blame David Cockfosters Wallace most recently, and before him, Tom Wolfe and John Updike. This guy Dave Eggers is also horrible. There are many others. All of them wrote, or write, bloatedly and badly. They persuaded me only that they were whiners and fakes and sentimentalists. They became media superstars because they wrote about trivial and safe stuff that posed no challenge. These guys could be cute, and they constantly asserted their sincerity, but never were they funny. If anything, they demonstrated only the meaninglessness of language. Anyway, now we are oppressed by several generations of their imitators. Believe me, it’s not that difficult as a writer to just skate across things, add some emotional ferment here and there, some cleverness and irony and oddity, attack with the modifiers, and you’re done. Well, the literary world is polluted with this stuff. And yes, most writers insist on being bad. They are looking for easy handouts from their socio-economic cohort. They just want to get by. They’re not interested in cursing the gods for the pathetic fate of being human.<br><br><strong>Do you like any writers at all?</strong><br><br>Dostoyevsky and Dickens. Philip K. Dick. Nobody else, really. I have super sweet spots for Knut Hamsun, Kafka and Nathanael West, along with Teenage Fanclub’s “The Concept”. . . . but those first three fellows are my masters.<br><br><strong>A particular triumph of <em>The News Clown</em>  is how it nimbly alternates between the political situation and the personal – how it combines the outrageous with the ordinary. It’s also permeated with death and sex, and both are approached in a way that’s both horrifying and humorous.</strong><br><br>Right. What I wanted to do in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-News-Clown-Novel-Garcia-ebook/dp/B00DE11UKQ" rel="nofollow">
  <em>The News Clown</em>
</a> was strip away all cloudy language and sentimentalism. I’d reached a point where I’d just had enough of such things. I wanted to write a clean, raw book about the horror and hystericism of the time. Plus sex and fucked relationships. . . . I had a few agents complain to me that it didn’t have a jokey, fraudulent plot, something conventional and obvious that they could understand. You know, something like the bad guy is exposed through some clever deduction by the flawed but heroic hero. Well, no. I wasn’t interested in anything like that. In <em>The News Clown</em>, everyone is lousy and everything is constantly, brutally, exposed. The plot was the war and the propaganda and this young man’s struggle to climb an imaginary ladder and get laid. I wanted to destroy politics, destroy religion, reveal the war economy, the propaganda economy, show the madness and delusion of human relationships. I also wanted it to be the kind of book where you could open to any page at random, read it and have a laugh. I wanted people to be entertained, but still recognize that something real about the world and our condition was being talked about.<br><br><strong>Do you think you succeeded?</strong><br><br>Of course not. I wrote only a book that cracks me up. I think it’s funny, that’s all. I guess that’s a gigantic triumph. It’s been praised and condemned by reviewers for various reasons, but I don’t think anybody’s really understood the totality of it. Before I started, you know, I had already been through years of trial and error. Years of failures and tiny successes, first as a journalist and then in attempts at fiction. I had a pretty good idea by then of what worked for me and what didn’t. I had already been rejected dozens and dozens of times. I had suffered the pulverizing shock of rejection as a writer. I had encountered the jealous and the haters, people who wanted to tear me down as a writer for whatever reason. I was a seasoned veteran of the literary wars, which are very real and can be frightening if you take them seriously. . . . So I had been through all that, and none of it mattered anymore. It was the ultimate freedom, in a way. I just wanted to get this <em>News Clown</em> nightmare down as cleanly as I imagined it.<br><br><strong>You said it took seven years to write. That’s really long.</strong><br><br>Longer, actually. Seven years for the <em>first draft</em>, which came in at something like 160,000 words. Then there were several years after that of editing and rewriting and entering it contests and sending it to agents and publishers. It was a ridiculous project, in many ways. I had to create and populate a whole city, Bay City, create this universe in which the reporter operates. I had never done something similar before. When I realized that this is what I had to do, when I was already about two years into the writing, I almost quit. It seemed impossible. It seemed like it would take five more years, which is not what I originally had in mind. . . . Anyway, at that point it became an obsession for me. I turned into a madman. I jumped all over it like splooge on a hooker’s tits. Nothing was going to stop me. It became the main thing. It took me over the edge. I was doing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-News-Clown-Novel-Garcia-ebook/dp/B00DE11UKQ" rel="nofollow">
  <em>The News Clown</em>
</a> full time, working full time, being a father full time, being married full time, drinking full time. It actually ended up being a big factor in the break-up of my marriage. Right near the end, my wife decided she didn’t want to be married to a crazed writer, a two-fisted drinking writer who was writing a book called <em>The News Clown</em>. Like most women, she wanted a soft guy who would do exactly as he was told, say the right things at social gatherings. I was so disappointing in that sense. She imagined there were tons of these perfect guys out there, who were also rich and funny and so on. Well, she’s had some experiences. She now takes mood-control drugs, in fact she’s hooked on them. . . . But I've got no regrets. It’s all been majestic. Better than dreams.<br><br><strong>Discussions of so-called “conspiracy theories” are woven throughout <em>The News Clown</em>. What is it about conspiracy theories that attracts your interest?</strong><br><br>Well, first of all, the first version, and later the official version, that we hear about remarkable events is never the truth. At best, it’s a partial truth. Even years later, we’re never really sure about exactly what happened. I mean, we‘ve probably never yet gotten to the bottom of what really happened in the Lincoln assassination plot. There’s still questions there. . . . Anyway, so the more I started to look at so-called conspiracy theories, and who argued in support of them and who ridiculed them, the more I realized that this stuff is really about politics - it's a political shorthand, if you will. You can usually get an accurate sense of someone’s politics and their approach to the world by seeing how they react in response to conspiracy theories. It reveals something essential about someone’s personality. . . . Someone who is heavily invested in the status quo, for example, usually becomes very uncomfortable during a conspiracy discussion. They will ridicule the proposition. They will usually launch <em>ad hominem</em> attacks on whoever is raising the conspiracy issue. They will do anything to avoid discussing the substance, the legitimate questions, raised by a particular theory. . . . Because for this person, the idea that something might not have happened in the way they were told, that in fact unseen powerful forces working for devious ends may have been responsible, well, it’s a direct challenge to their particular illusion of security. It cuts to the heart of their belief system. It challenges their assumption that the authorities, at some base level, are decent and benign and not vile, lying, manipulative shape-shifters performing nefarious acts for their own hidden goals. . . . People who embrace conspiracy theories, well – it’s a potent, alternative way of seeing the world. It’s a tool of rebellion. You are saying – no, things exactly <em>aren’t</em> as we’ve been told – in fact, they’re quite different and quite wicked. By arguing an alternative, “real” truth, you are rising up tangibly against the vested interests. You are saying you’re not going to take what they are serving up. . . . I tend to see the conspiracy-minded person as primarily wanting change, for whatever reason. The conspiracy is used as a weapon against whomever they feel is being unfair or repressive. It’s a clever way of holding those at the top responsible. Usually, I’ve found, the conspiracy person has had some unfortunate encounter with authority, or has personally glimpsed, usually at a very mundane level, some actual corruption and lying and wool-pulling by someone in authority. . . . Also, though, and mainly – it must be admitted that conspiracies are great fun. There cannot be any real doubt at this point that those in power are frequently neck deep in the most despicable of plots. . . . I mean, who ever would have thought the U.S. government actually would have been responsible for infecting black men with syphilis, in the Tuskeegee experiments, which went on in secret from the 1930s all the way to the 70s? Well, girl, you know it’s true.<br><br><strong>You live in the Czech Republic. How did it happen that you wrote a devastating social commentary about America from the center of Europe? Did you need the distance to see your country in a new light?</strong><br><br>Absolutely. There’s no way I would have written <em>The News Clown</em> in America. I probably would have written some sentimental shit about a football coach and fixing cars or something, the glory of drinking beer with a teen girl while sitting in the shade of my Ford Thunderbird. Sounds good, I still may write that, actually. . . . But anyway, I knew from the age of about 15 that eventually I’d leave America. There was no other option. I was going to break out of the family hell and the suffocating control system – those are the main reasons for why I took off, and it more or less stops there. . . . I’m extremely grateful for all the opportunities I was given as a youth in America. There were many of them, and they were unparalleled. I mean, chatting about police brutality with a Nobel Prize winner on a beach – well, thank you, whoever you are, for everything. Everything was heaven. Everything was hideous. I tended to be more focused on the hideous. . . . Anyway, but as I moved through my 20s, I started to see how new, hard edges were settling over America, how the previously vast opportunities were being slowly but methodically curtailed. Everyone was working a little harder for a little less. There were a lot of empty looks in a lot of eyes. And of course things were getting more and more sinister – the Rodney King beating and the Los Angeles riots, the Branch Davidian massacre, Cobain offed himself, Tonya Harding, poisonous geeks like Lee Atwater running wild. . . . America is a grand control system, ultimately, the most effective ever devised. Sophisticated economic and cultural levers are used to keep the population in line, to make sure everyone is serving the powers. . . . It seemed to me then, and it’s even more the case now, that America always assumes you are doing something wrong. And they will find out and expose you. It’s the default position. It’s a society in love with the crackdown. This has deep roots, of course, going back to the Christian extremists and slaveholders. . . . There’s also a very intense social pressure that insists that you need a lot of money to enjoy the true bounty of America’s freedom. And then, of course, when you get to the position of having serious assets, you need to sign up with the authorities to make sure your interests are protected. What kind of freedom does that end up being? American teenagers are very adept at seeing the fraud and hypocrisy of it. . . . It ends up being more cops, more rules, more restrictions, more sanctimonious church-going, more flaunting of baubles, less generosity. Throughout my years of living full-time in America, I saw how the whole package was driving people insane, turning them into fools. I found myself in opposition to nearly everything other people seemed to want. I wanted to get away from the madness, find a place to breathe and think. I was lucky enough to find it in the Czech Republic.<br><br><strong>In what way?</strong><br><br>In many ways, this country may be the closest thing to heaven on earth. Most Czechs have no interest in religion, for example. They admit they’re quaintly immoral, and so most of them stay away from moralizing. I appreciate it. They enjoy sex, drinking, lying, laughing, cheating. They have plenty of faults, and there are a great many casual crooks and dog lovers and still too many men pissing openly on the streets. . . . But most Czechs can’t be bothered with trying to impose their insanity on you. They’ve learned their lessons. Mostly they want to live and let live. They usually won’t go hardcore outside of a sexual context. As long as you respect a certain loose boundary, you’re pretty much free to do as you like. . . . But I suppose I live in a unique zone – I’m not submerged in Czech culture, and I’m also outside the American bubble. I’m looking at both, but from a distance. I regard this space as a treasure. I am not bombarded and weighed down by either. . . . I enjoy that I don’t have to have my time wasted by having to constantly listen to stuff about, say, what’s going on with the Chicago Cubs or the latest, greatest television show of all time. . . . And I don’t have to be thinking about whatever lies some corrupt politician is saying on Czech television, although that probably could be good for a little laugh.<br><br><strong>Did you take part in the Expat Renaissance of Prague, a time and place famously dubbed “the Paris of the 90s”? What was that like?</strong><br><br>Yes, I did partake. It was amazing, beyond words. Non-stop fucking of random European girls and drinking until the early morning hours. Each and every day. All day and all night. Everybody was hilarious and a brilliant artist working on some new amazing thing. The music was never better. You shoulda been there, man. . . . Well, then everybody died or moved back to Knoxville, or married a Czech woman and had children and began living that particular hell. We are extremely lucky. We cannot have asked for more.<br><br><br><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5805766.Thor_Garcia">

</a> <br><br><br><br>PRAGUE (CNS) – The terribly lonely girl sat on the lap of the emotionally devastated boy. They were taking the tram to her place – but not for sex. Absolutely not. Only to spend a little intimate time together. To discover if any deeper agreement could be reached.<br><br>Already that evening, they had seen a cute film about death. Big stars, reassuring messages, themes involving death and immortality, but addressed comfortingly, soothingly, wistfully, everyone with clear skin. They had walked out into the cold and proceeded to kiss and grope on a bench in a darkened commercial square. They been harassed by a bum. The boy had given the ragamuffin several cigarettes and a lighter. A truce had been declared.<br><br>The kissing had been, yes, nice. They had enjoyed each other’s warmth. Yet it remained tantalizingly unclear whether a more significant accord could be achieved. The breakthrough remained tantalizingly just out of reach.<br><br>She found him charming, astute, funny, at ease with his body and hers. It had been quite unusual, she thought, to have found him casting around so aimlessly on internet dating sites. She had begun to feel a bit dismayed, however, even somewhat alarmed, by his apparent obsession with conspiracy theories, or what seemed to be the consuming darkness of his worldview. He was apt to veer off into this territory quite suddenly. “Enlightened pessimism,” he had called it, adding with a sly grin: “Everything backed up by facts – or at least partial facts, from the partial story, as carefully selected from the half-ass ramblings of those with an ax to grind.”<br><br>She had laughed. But, wow, whoa – this was simply “negative,” wasn’t it, rather gloom n’doom. It was slightly troubling. Why, after all, would you burden yourself with such issues? There were too many sweet things, sweet ordinary things, in life. Why not pursue <em>them?</em> But she didn’t mention it. She was entranced. He continued to surprise and surprise.<br><br>In a way, she was flattered he felt comfortable enough to discuss these things with her – but why should she care about his “no planes” theories about the September 11 attacks, or the “real reasons” behind the crack epidemic in Los Angeles, or the “fraud” of the recycling industry, his apparently sincere belief that “hate, greed and sheer cruelty” were the dominant factors of human existence, or how the internet had ushered in a “new era of human bondage, one we may never escape from until civilization is destroyed”? Or that he believed U.S. foreign policy since World War II, and continuing to this day, had been <em>about</em> creating disorder and chaos around the world? <br><br>“Wherever there’s war and chaos, America can move in and manipulate things to our advantage,” he had said. She was mildly startled to hear it expressed so forthrightly. “It’s in our interest to start wars and meddle everywhere we can, or at least where there’s a few bucks to be grabbed. We go around setting traps for these dictators and crappy countries. Then we create war and chaos, going in and bombing somewhere, or making sure a war breaks out. ‘Creative destruction’ they actually call it. So-called human rights and democracy have very little to do with it – I mean, look at our <em>good,</em> compliant friends Saudi Arabia, one of the worst abusers of rights in the world. They got the bucks, right, they run the gas station. So <em>no problemo</em>. Same with the terrorist groups, or whatever other nasty specimens who appear. Sometimes we like them, sometimes they’re worse than Satan, depending on what we want to do. It’s all quite hilarious, except for all the people who have to die or get their countries destroyed. The big strategy is just, ‘Fuck stuff up,’ and don’t let anybody challenge us. . . .”<br><br>“Hmmm, that’s quite interesting, really,” she had said, though she wasn’t sure if she really felt that way. The proposition, this one in particular, seemed altogether too problematic. It flew in the face of so much, of nearly everything, that most people, at least most Americans, seemed to believe – even her father, who was certainly no fan of America’s various activities. . . .<br><br>Not that his ideas weren’t, in some way, interesting and insightful, and she found his enthusiasm for them boyish and cute. And perhaps he made good points. And to his credit, he never insisted that she <em>agree</em> with what he said – he would simply toss the ideas out there, see how she reacted. He didn’t harp, he hadn’t sent website links in an attempt to “prove” his ideas, he’d never subjected her to interrogation to make her reveal what she “really thought.” Some men, she remembered unpleasantly, had seemed to expect their pronouncements to be met with applause and proclamations of their genius. He seemed to regard his theories as a mere conversation topic, like the weather or a rumination the difficulty of obtaining decent crunchy pickles in Prague. And why didn’t this town have decent crunchy pickles? <br><br>But in truth, these were minor issues and she was ready to overlook them. Because listen: She was a woman in her early thirties, without children, not married and with a job she didn’t much care for. They had been e-mailing nearly daily for the past three weeks, and she had to admit: She had begun to spend much of each day thinking about him, even feeling a little electric thrill flit through her midsection when she thought about seeing him again. She had learned enough to know by now that all men were odd in their way (and often they smelled funny) and <em>everyone</em> had shortcomings.<br><br>She had learned that the hard way with Zack, her boyfriend of eight years, whom she had thought so perfect for at least five of those years, until she had put together clues that had piled up over the years and, to her horror, understood he’d had a sexual relationship with his half-sister through most of his teenage years and into his twenties . . . and no, he hadn’t denied it when she couldn’t stop thinking about it and finally confronted him. He downplayed it, tried to explained it both as a product of a strange family life and a “human need,” but something that was undoubtedly, now, forever in the past, and she realized only that he was a man in need of help. . . . But anyway, it was better to focus on strengths, on convergences, on what could be shared and grown. . . .<br><br>During cocktails one evening at the Theater of Comedy, the emotionally ruined girl had told the emotionally wrecked boy that she had been six years in psychotherapy, but had stopped about 18 months ago, right before she began her latest round of moving from city to city. One of the big subjects of the therapy, of course, had been her eight-year relationship. She saw now that he and she had been “too co-dependent.” She now believed people were better off if they were able to achieve what she called “genuine co-interdependence.”<br><br>Did he know what she meant?<br><br>“Yeah, kind of like. . . . No, not really.” He laughed. “Probably like, you’re together and need each other in some way. . . Yet you’re not <em>so</em> much together and not really needing each other <em>so</em> much. Like, you don’t really flip out when the other person’s not around or does something you don’t like. Giving each other a little space, maybe? Caring a little more than a little bit, but not too much . . . yeah, kind of just the right amount, but never to the extent that it ever gets crazy? Like, ‘Whatever, man,’ but never actually saying ‘Whatever, man,’ because like, you care a little more, or a lot more, than that? Well, darn.”<br><br>She laughed. “Yeah, I guess.”<br><br>She talked about how her father had gone hardcore Christian. Every time she spoke with him, he would say how he was “concerned” about her “soul.” She knew it was a cliché, but what could she say? Her father claimed to believe that Jesus was the only true savior of humanity.<br><br>“Is he happy?”<br><br>She shrugged. “Not really. I don’t think so.”<br><br>She described a man who had spent his life working for the United States Air Force. He had flown helicopters in the Vietnam War, fulfilling missions in which many poor Vietnamese were killed. Yes, he had killed for Uncle Sam, and not courageously so. Then he had retired from the Air Force and joined the Bell company, selling helicopters, parts and training packages to the U.S. military. He was using the knowledge the military had equipped him with to sell back to the military what it had taught him. It was a good income, and it had helped raising the four children. But he despised it now and had become a hardcore Christian, believing in salvation through surrender to Christ.<br><br>“Your parents, they’re happy together?”<br><br>She shrugged. “They’re a team. They know their lives could have been different. But they kind of feel, you know, they did a pretty good thing having a family and staying together.”<br><br>She wasn’t sure about getting married now. It might be nice, but it didn’t seem completely necessary. She was, though, looking for a “partner.” And yes, she was hoping for kids. Two would be nice, and she wouldn’t rule out more if things seemed to be going well. Yet she was aware she was getting old. There might not be time for more than two before the body clock ran out.<br><br>The tram arrived at her stop at Klamovka. They disembarked and walked to her building, holding hands. They had to be very quiet going in. Her landlords did not approve of noise at night. They were from that breed of Czech sticklers, and they had set down rules that she had agreed to. No noise after 9 p.m., and absolutely no messes in the shared rooms. <br><br>She showed him a handwritten list of rules stuck up in the kitchen, and another list in the bathroom.

  <strong>Thor Garcia</strong>
</a> <br><br><br><br>PRAGUE (CNS) – On their first date, several weeks ago, the lonely and emotionally disfigured pair had gone to see a Kelley Cutesack movie about death – and the “prospect” of life after death. The film was a jumble of scenes of confusion, suicide, several trenchant deaths . . . followed by pain, dizziness, “rebirth,” hugs performed in an apparent dream state, and more confusion, but of a lightly confectionary, fluffy sort, designed to manufacture false feelings of “uplift” in the viewer. They walked out feeling narcotized, hungry and a little bereft, as roughly intended by the filmmakers. <br><br>She shook his hand briskly and went home. After buying ten beers and a bottle of schnapps for himself, he had e-mailed her that night and the next day. And, she had to admit, he had intrigued her.<br><br>He: Decently tall, broad-shouldered, moderately muscled. A well-shaped nose and sensuous lips, but with several light scars on his chin and cheekbones. Attractively crinkled skin around his blue eyes – but the expression of the eyes complicated by something both wounded and brave. Funny, with the sort of humor that could make her burst out laughing . . . yet humor of a – a what? A sophisticatedly ironic sort, she thought, quite different from the doltish and goofy clichés offered by the vast majority of men. Humor, she decided, that walked the delicate line between belittling others and laughing at oneself for having such a thought in the first place. <br><br>She analyzed swiftly that there was something in him hidden and off-limits – a core that he probably never revealed to anyone.<br><br>She very much liked his natural <em>California-ness</em> – his casual, comfortable and cool approach, combined with what seemed to be a benign indifference to . . .  well, almost everything. She would later describe him to friends as possessing a mystifying “intimate distance.” The way he spoke seeming to suggest mysteries and depths, but whose secrets he wouldn’t easily, if ever, reveal. If, indeed, there was any “secret” he harbored at all. She had read a few of his stories that were posted on the internet, and she had found them to be smart and funny, even breathtaking and possibly brilliant in their way – and yes, quite clearly absurd and ridiculous in parts. The message: Nothing was sacred. He seemed to be making fun of the whole world. At the same time, he didn’t seem to care much about it. It was all just a wicked little dream – the absurd, the cruel and the delusionary, freely mixing.<br><br>Two days later, they went to the Colonial Café by the old Jewish cemetery. She drank cocktails, about one every forty minutes. He had six vodka gimlets and four beers. He saw how lovely she was, and was delighted . . . . her long straight hair, straight white teeth and pink gums. . . . He was surprised by her ease, how relaxed she seemed, how much she <em>got</em> him. It had been some time, he was sure, since someone had <em>got</em> him as much as she did.<br><br>She told stories about the people at her work:  The idiot editor “Bob,” the unstable Japanese photographer Michi, the totally perfect Czech reporter Helena, who went to the gym every day, never ate fat, and had the perfect boyfriend who worked for Accentura . . . the ugly and hysterical Americans Linda and Rufus, who were trying to hide their fucking relationship but were fooling absolutely no one. . . . It was slightly annoying, he thought, that she apparently thought he would care about these people he had never met. But he didn’t say anything. He nodded his head with interest, lit a cigarette, finished his glasses and ordered another round.<br><br>About his work, he said merely: “Well, most of them are talentless frauds, flagrantly so, but they’ve learned the techniques of covering it up with skillful glad-handing, copious use of jargon and code-words, and ambitious sweater-wearing. There’s a little incestuous, sociopathic clique of them who’ve somehow wound up in charge. They shuffle around with their heads down, hoping no one notices them . . . then suddenly they’ll lash out with a vicious, accusatory e-mail. Or they spout controlling, arrogant, vicious nonsense with a sinister smile and chummy laugh, inspiring dread and fear. I mean, they do some of the best lip-service in town, all the while driving everything into the ground and constantly threatening to fire everyone. It’s weird. . . .The result is that the place is infected by a genuine psychic terrorism. You never know who’s going to attack next or on what pretext. It’s depressing, really. They don’t seem to realize that with so much fear and double-talk, they’re killing motivation and deadening souls, and so most people on put in basic, perfunctory performances just to get the paycheck. . . .”<br><br>“Wow,” she said. “Heavy. It’s always good to stay away from big bureaucracies. It’s well established that the psychos always rise to the top in such places. . . .”<br><br>“That’s certainly true here. I could go on. But I won’t. Maybe later. . . .”<br><br>She talked about how she had six years of “quality” education, yet it hadn’t guaranteed a thing. She had been an all-A student, in high school and through the various universities, yet had no idea what she should be doing. The journalism gig, frankly, had been a dud ticket. She liked things about it, the ideals and so on. . . . But no one in the business seemed to honor the ideals anymore, if they ever had. A dud was a dud and it had been a mistake, she now felt.<br><br>He nodded his head sympathetically. “It’s pretty safe to assume that most media is just propaganda for one faction of the government and corporations or other. Thus has always been the case, alas. The media itself is a big purveyor of the fiction that it ‘used to be’ any different. There’s big money and interests at stake in fooling the general population. The main goal, I think, is to assault people with red herrings and dubious presumptions. A grudging consent is thus obtained, and the status quo strengthens and endures. Everything turns into a joke and any real movement for change is nipped in the bud. . . .”<br><br>After college, she had lived for eight years with a boyfriend, “Zack.” This fellow had followed her from town to town as she pursued her news career, mainly in New Hampshire and Massachusetts. He had done work in the information sphere, mainly technical writing, instructions for computer programs and so on. Her family, her mother and father, had become very close to this fellow, he had been like a member of the family.<br><br>They would get married – she was <em>so</em> sure. But a date was never set.<br><br>Then, one day, she “found out something about him,” and she knew they could never be married. She had to break up with him. She ended it that very evening.<br><br>“You found out he has a secret romance with German shepherds or something?”<br><br>She giggled. “No! It’s not that exciting!”<br><br>“What, he kill somebody?”<br><br>“No. I’m sorry, I can’t tell you. . . . He’s my best friend. Still.”<br><br>“Huh?”<br><br>He didn’t like to hear that. She and this fellow still e-mailed almost every day, she explained, and talked by telephone at least once a week – even though he had moved off to San Francisco and allegedly had a new girlfriend.<br><br>This was frustrating, and he found himself vaguely resenting her for it. But why? What right did he have to be jealous or resentful over . . . <em>this</em>? Or anything about her?<br><br>The idea that he could be resentful or jealous of a woman – <em>him</em>, at this point – seemed fantastical. At the same time, he couldn’t shake the thought that something wasn’t right with this fellow still being on the scene so much. Well, but people – well, they were confused. If one expected too much from them, one was certain to be disappointed, often grievously so.<br><br><br><strong>TO  BE  CONTINUED</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5805766.Thor_Garcia">

He was surprised by her ease, how relaxed she seemed, how much she <em>got</em> him. It had been some time, he was sure, since someone had <em>got</em> him as much as she did.<br><br>She told stories about the people at her work:  The idiot editor “Bob,” the unstable Japanese photographer Michi, the totally perfect Czech reporter Helena, who went to the gym every day, never ate fat, and had the perfect boyfriend who worked for Accentura . . . the ugly and hysterical Americans Linda and Rufus, who were trying to hide their fucking relationship but were fooling absolutely no one. . . . It was slightly annoying, he thought, that she apparently thought he would care about these people he had never met. But he didn’t say anything. He nodded his head with interest, lit a cigarette, finished his glasses and ordered another round.<br><br>About his work, he said merely: “Well, most of them are talentless frauds, flagrantly so, but they’ve learned the techniques of covering it up with skillful glad-handing, copious use of jargon and code-words, and ambitious sweater-wearing. There’s a little incestuous, sociopathic faction who’ve somehow wound up in charge. They shuffle around with their heads down, hoping no one notices them . . . then suddenly they’ll lash out with a vicious, accusatory e-mail. Or they spout controlling, arrogant, vicious nonsense with a sinister smile and chummy laugh, inspiring dread and fear. I mean, they do some of the best lip-service in town, all the while driving everything into the ground and constantly threatening to fire everyone. It’s weird. . . .The result is that the place is infected by a genuine psychic terrorism. You never know who’s going to attack next or on what pretext. It’s depressing, really. They don’t seem to realize that with so much fear and double-talk, they’re killing motivation and deadening souls, and so most people on put in basic, perfunctory performances just to get the paycheck. . . .”<br><br>“Wow,” she said. “Heavy. It’s always good to stay away from big bureaucracies. It’s well established that the psychos always rise to the top in such places. . . .”<br><br>“That’s certainly true here. I could go on. But I won’t. Maybe later. . . .”<br><br>She talked about how she had six years of “quality” education, yet it hadn’t guaranteed a thing. She had been an all-A student, in high school and through the various universities, yet had no idea what she should be doing. The journalism gig, frankly, had been a dud ticket. She liked things about it, the ideals and so on. . . . But no one in the business seemed to honor the ideals anymore, if they ever had. A dud was a dud and it had been a mistake, she now felt.<br><br>He nodded his head sympathetically. “It’s pretty safe to assume that most media is just propaganda for one faction of the government and corporations or other. Thus has always been the case, alas. The media itself is a big purveyor of the fiction that it ‘used to be’ any different. There’s big money and interests at stake in fooling the general population. The main goal, I think, is to assault people with red herrings and dubious presumptions. A grudging consent is thus obtained, and the status quo strengthens and endures. Everything turns into a joke and any real movement for change is nipped in the bud. . . .”<br><br>After college, she had lived for eight years with a boyfriend, “Zack.” This fellow had followed her from town to town as she pursued her news career, mainly in New Hampshire and Massachusetts. He had done work in the information sphere, mainly technical writing, instructions for computer programs and so on. Her family, her mother and father, had become very close to this fellow, he had been like a member of the family.<br><br>They would get married – she was <em>so</em> sure. But a date was never set.<br><br>Then, one day, she “found out something about him,” and she knew they could never be married. She had to break up with him. She ended it that very evening.<br><br>“You found out he has a secret romance with German shepherds or something?”<br><br>She giggled. “No! It’s not that exciting!”<br><br>“What, he kill somebody?”<br><br>“No. I’m sorry, I can’t tell you. . . . He’s my best friend. Still.”<br><br>“Huh?”<br><br>He didn’t like to hear that. She and this fellow still e-mailed almost every day, she explained, and talked by telephone at least once a week – even though he had moved off to San Francisco and allegedly had a new girlfriend.<br><br>This was frustrating, and he found himself vaguely resenting her for it. But why? What right did he have to be jealous or resentful over . . . <em>this</em>? Or anything about her?<br><br>The idea that he could be resentful or jealous of a woman – <em>him</em>, at this point – seemed fantastical. At the same time, he couldn’t shake the thought that something wasn’t right with this fellow still being on the scene so much. Well, but people – well, they were confused. If one expected too much from them, one was certain to be disappointed, often grievously so.<br><br><br><strong>TO  BE  CONTINUED</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5805766.Thor_Garcia">
