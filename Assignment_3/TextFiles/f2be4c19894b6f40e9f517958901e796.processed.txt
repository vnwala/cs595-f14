[19]Greg: A Resume In Story Form

   Greg knew a lot about technology. He could plug machines into outlets.
   He could turn on a computer. And he could calculate complex addition on
   a TI-84 calculator. He was the kind of technological savant that rarely
   appeared behind the counter of a fast-food chain. For the people of
   Huntsville, Alabama, however, seeing such an intellectually superior
   human being handle their food was commonplace.

   Greg was born in Little Rock, Arkansas and lived there until his eighth
   birthday, when his mother kidnapped him from Whack’s Cotton Candy World
   and drove the two of them to her sister’s apartment in Huntsville. Greg
   would soon become a local hero amongst Huntsvillian’s, as the
   adolescent, at a mere ten years old, suggested to the mayor’s office
   that the town replace the maple syrup from the town’s water fountains
   with water. It was the kind of out-of-the-box thinking that had evaded
   Huntsville for centuries, leading to it’s designation as  the
   most “City Desperate For Ideas and An Intellectual Stalwart Named
   Greg.”

   Greg breezed through high school, earning straight A’s without even
   studying for most of his tests. While other students were out rollin’
   doobies and engaging in adult humps before marriage, Greg was at home,
   slouched in his desk chair, pounding on his meat slab and grasping for
   air as the tie around his neck tightened. Other students saw Greg as a
   threat due to his incredible athletic ability. Many students didn’t
   partake in gym because there was no chance they’d beat Greg. Greg
   received four football scholarships from Division I schools, 51
   baseball scholarships and a $1.4 billion offer to play professional
   Kabaddi in Pakistan. Instead, in an act of God-like humility, Greg
   turned down all the offers and instead took up work at a Chevy
   dealership on the outskirts of town.

   However, selling cars came too easily for Greg – and he was let go
   after selling 154 cars during his first day on the job. A cover story
   ran in The New York Times about Greg’s sales accomplishments, but it
   was pulled seconds before being published due to the shocking news that
   someone from the car dealership stole $11 and got high during their
   lunch break. They were never able to specify who did the egregious
   deed, but rest assured, it wasn’t Greg.

   Greg’s biggest weakness is that he has nothing but strengths. Able to
   bench-press 566 pounds, Greg was invited to Dallas Cowboys training
   camp in 2011, but was sent home after a week because he had injured
   everyone on the team from his massive, incredibley masculine and
   powerful tackles. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones sent Greg a medal
   accomplishing him on his excellence at tackling, but FedEx lost the box
   and it was never seen again.

   Greg is the kind of citizen that has ample amounts of references, but
   is unable to disclose them with the public due to doctor-patient
   confidentiality. Considering that Greg is the only licensed physician
   east of the Mississippi River, it would prove quite difficult for any
   of Greg’s previous employers to discuss his past performances. But,
   Greg assures you, he’s won Employee of the Month 43 months in a row, no
   matter where he’s been employed.

   Greg never enrolled in college classes because he scored a 4500 on the
   SAT’s and was declared a genius by several scientists at NASA. College
   was deemed a waste of time and he was honored with a steak dinner at
   the Obama’s vacation cabin in Loveland, Colorado.

   Greg is available to work on Tuesdays from 3-6.  The rest of his time
   is spent developing cures for various diseases and spying on his
   neighbor Yonique – a stripper who forgets to pull the blinds down
   when she gets dressed for work.

   If you wish to contact Greg about any open positions, just scream the
   phrase “maple syrup in a can?!? I’ve seen worse!” and he should appear
   within 48 hours. If he does not respond, try sending an email to
   greg@greg.com. He doesn’t own a telephone because he can read minds. He
   knows you’re thinking about toothpaste and that girl from Zumba class
   who looked just like Jennifer Garner. She’s not interested so look
   elsewhere Romeo.

   Greg is not affiliated with the Greenville Road Warriors of the ECHL
   and any association between Greg and the ladder is subject to
   prosecution. Greg is an honorary President in the African countries of
   Sudan, Chad and Madagascar, as well as holding several honorary degrees
   from universities in Iceland and Denmark. Greg’s great-grandfather was
   not Joseph Stalin. In the event of a major catastrophe, Greg can be
   reached by pointing both of your shoes at the sky and singing that Katy
   Perry song about Friday Night’s. Greg is a non-profit organization,
   according to the U.S. Board of Extraordinary Human Beings. Board
   chairman and former Olympic swimmer Mark Spitz says that Greg is the
   coolest person he’s ever met and that he would like to be Greg’s best
   friend. Greg is currently writing a script for Shark Tale 2 and an
   independent family comedy about a colony of feral cats who run a comedy
   club. Both scripts have been approved by Paramount Pictures and
   production should begin at some point tomorrow or on Thursday. Greg is
   not the creator of the day Wednesday, but will take credit for legally
   changing “Sunday” to “Gumbus Loomdan”. Greg is not 12 feet tall, he is
   9-foot-4.  Greg cannot be reproduced or recorded during adult hump time
   without express written consent from Major League Baseball and Mark
   Ruffalo’s production company, “I Was The Hulk, Give Me Some Fucking
   Credit Inc.”

[23]Fantasy Football Streaming Options: Week 2

   [24](photo courtesy HamptonRoads.com)

   Wide Receiver #3 Scores Points During A Game Of American Football!


   If you’re in a rut with your fantasy lineup, then you’ve come to the
   right place. After a week filled with upsets, injuries and a lots of
   competition, it’s time to revamp your dull, untalented fantasy football
   lineup. Every week I’ll be listing some guys you should go pick up off
   of the waiver wire, allowing you to impress everyone in your league by
   consistently rolling out sleeper-after-sleeper week-after-week.

   E.J. Manuel – QB, Buffalo Bills

   If you don’t own E.J. Manuel, you should change that. Manuel lead the
   Bills to a 20-17 overtime victory Sunday in Chicago – completing 16 of
   22 passes for 173 yards and a touchdown in the process. A lot of
   fantasy owners are frightened of Manuel due to the fact he plays for
   Buffalo – a team that hasn’t seen postseason football in 15 years.

   Sammy Watkins gives Manuel a vertical threat, and the combination of
   C.J. Spiller and Fred Jackson gives Buffalo enough depth for when one
   of them inevitably gets injured.

   Buffalo hosts the Miami Dolphins next week, so even if you start Manuel
   we suggest finding another game to watch.


   Gabe Jackson – OG, Oakland Raiders

   According to ESPN, Jackson is shockingly owned in 0% of Fantasy
   leagues. A rookie out of Mississippi State, Jackson weighs an
   astounding 336 pounds and plays offensive guard – one of five offensive
   line positions available during a routine play from scrimmage.

   While some Fantasy owners are weary the 6-foot-3 native of Liberty,
   Mississippi doesn’t get nearly enough touches to warrant a spot in a
   standard leagues free agent pool, we’re expecting a career high in
   grunting, pushing and standing in front of other people this Sunday
   when Oakland hosts AFC South deadweight Houston.


   Jacksonville Jaguars – Entire Team, AFC South

   If given the opportunity, we suggest you scoop up the entire Jaguars
   team this week. Traveling to Washington D.C., the Jaguars square off
   against a morally questionable organization from the nation’s capital.
   There’s a house adjacent to my grandmother’s that’s rumored to be
   haunted by the spirits of Native Americans who were laid to rest in the
   land that is now real estate in the town of East Weymouth,
   Massachusetts – so I don’t fuck with ghosts or Indians. Not one bit.

   With the Redskins continuing to be stubborn and failing to relinquish
   their ethnically offensive name, expect horrible, horrible things to
   occur at FedEx Field this Sunday (Punter Tress Way will probably piss
   himself at the 50-yard-line, again).


   Mark Ruffalo – Critically Acclaimed Actor, Free Agent

   Actor Mark Ruffalo is not employed by an NFL team, nor am I entirely
   sure he’s ever played organized football before. But something tells me
   the 46-year-old native of Kenosha, Wisconsin will have a big Sunday –
   making his much anticipated debut, as his hometown George Nelson
   Tremper High Trojans take on Canadian rival Holy Name of Mary Catholic
   Secondary School of the Felician Sisters. The all girls school from
   Brampton, Ontario looks to earn their 5th consecutive win over a United
   States high school program. But the Hulk actor will look to kick, run,
   punt, pass and catch his way past this pesky squad of teenage girls
   from the great north and into the Kenosha record books.
   [25]"first down!"

   “first down!”


   I hope this helped. Check back next week for my Week 3 sleepers!

[29]Live Blogging My Call Of Duty Games Today

   I’m going to play some Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 this afternoon and
   because I’m extremely annoying I’m going to live blog about it.
     * 3:18 PM – turned on my PS3 and am now waiting for PlayStation
       All-Stars Battle Royale to finish installing. I cannot access
       anything else until it is done. I have never heard of the game, but
       it was the free game of the month so what the hell. I just
       scratched my genitals because there was a slight itch.
     * 3:19 PM – still downloading. This is taking a really long time, so
       I’m going to listen to Spotify.
     * 3:20 PM – Put on Aloha & The Three Johns by Jenny Lewis. Good
       shit.
     * 3:21 PM – Game is still downloading. This better be the greatest
       game ever known to mankind because it’s been three minutes and I’d
       like to #CallOfDuty #Hard right now.
     * 3:22 PM – Download is at 48%. This is a nightmare.
     * 3:23 PM – opening the pack of Wrigley’s Doublemint gum I bought at
       CVS the other day. Will have 2 pieces to try and eliminate the
       bird-shit-odor that I think is currently ruminating in my mouth.
       Download is now at 53%. We’re getting there.
     *  3:26 PM – 62%. 8 minutes for a fucking cartoon game. No wonder it
       was free. Listening to My Name Is by Eminem and am suddenly filled
       with teen angst and the desire to eat hard-boiled eggs.
     * 3:28 PM – Staring at the piggy bank on my desk and wondering where
       it all went wrong. I used to be a respectable person.
     * 3:29 PM – 86% and rising. My father is in the kitchen feeding one
       of the cats and I can hear him talking over the Cash Cash Remix of
       Katy Perry’s Birthday through my headphones. I enjoy Katy Perry’s
       music from time-to-time. I am not a cross-dresser who performs
       under the stage name Dr. Todd, however.
     * 3:31 PM – We’re done with the download. Took 13 minutes. Wow.
     * 3:32 PM – Call of Duty is loading. Time to #game.
     * 3:34 PM – Will be indulging in some multiplayer gameplay. I’m
       starting off in a free-for-all match that is in a intermission. I
       am ready to go on a virtual warpath.
     * 3:35 PM – It.Has.Begun.
     * 3:35 PM – I select my Cus555555567uuyhj custom class because both
       of the guns shoot a lot of bullets quickly. I hear this is a good
       way to kill other players – with bullets.
     * 3:35 PM – sitting by come oil barrels and waiting to #ownage on
       some noobs. Someone just blew up a helicopter. I walk away
       unscathed because I am really good.
     * 3:36 PM – Killed a noob but then was stabbed by some poser who
       thinks he’s on my level. I’ve been to a handful of frat parties.
       These people have no respect for their higher-ups.
     * 3:37 PM – I have been killed.
     * 3:38 PM – I have been killed.
     * 3:39 PM – killed a weiner-face but was then defeated (killed).
     * 3:39 PM – killed a noob.
     * 3:39 PM – I have been killed. Game over.
     * 3:40 PM – awarded the “sneaker” perk – given to the player who
       spends the most time crouching. This reminds me that I need to find
       a couch cover for the sofa in my room. I mean I can go without one
       but I’m getting annoyed by the blue color of the couch to be
       honest.
     * 3:41 PM – Game 2 is beginning.
     * 3:42 PM – Using my “Greg” custom class. It is named in honor of
       former Utah Jazz center Greg Ostertag. In consists of a shotgun and
       a pistol because those seem like Greg guns.
     * 3:43 PM – this level reminds me of that scene in Harry Potter when
       he runs his shopping cart into the brick pillar and everyone gives
       him that “bitch why you drinkin’ before 10 am?” look. This platform
       isn’t as inviting though. Nor are there any redheads with
       inferiority complexes.
     * 3:44 PM – Just killed two Class-A losers with my Ostercannon
       (shotgun).
     * 3:45 PM – I have been killed.
     * 3:45 PM – there is a small fire near one of the entrances to the
       station. This could become hazardous once patrons arrive looking to
       board their trains.
     * 3:46 PM – I have been killed. Listening to Fireball by Pitbull and
       I’m feeling a bit frisky to be honest.
     * 3:46 PM – I have been killed.
     * 3:46 PM – A box is on fire. Another safety hazard.
     * 3:47 PM – there is a fake ad for a vodka that implies it will – I
       have been killed – help you talk to women. I agree that alcohol can
       serve as a social lubricant. I am much more of a socialite around
       non-men when I – I have been killed – drink the liquor.
     * 3:48 PM – I have been killed. Game over.
     * 3:48 PM – I have received a snapchat from Meats Grande. It is a
       picture of his kneecap, with the caption “knee-cap or head of a
       penis?” Given the objects size to be larger than a grape, I can
       confidently say that it is his kneecap.
     * 3:51 PM – Just killed some idiot trying to jump over a truck.
     * 3:51 PM – I have been killed.
     * 3:51 PM – I have been killed.
     * 3:52 PM – Can get tickets – I have been killed – to SC-Georgia for
       $110. A week ago it was $130. Makes no sense but I’m not going to
       complain. Some jackass in jeans just ran past me and did not
       #warpath me. But that helicopter just did.
     * 3:53 PM – Shotguns are no match for a helicopter. I have been
       killed.
     * 3:54 PM – Stabbed a dude who just respawned and then was stabbed.
       Real roller coaster ride of emotions right there.
     * 3:54 PM – live blogging Call of Duty makes me realize that I don’t
       bring to the table when it comes to attracting the opposite sex.
     * 3:54 PM – I have been killed.
     * 3:56 PM – made gunfire and shit right now.
     * 3:56 PM – I have been killed. I wish clan tags were more than 4
       letters so I could be Porpoise Ron and the Boys.
     * 3:57 PM – The game has ended.
     * 4:00 PM – started a new game and have already been deathed 4 times.
       Time to open a can of whoop-ass and slay some turd-wagons on here.
     * 4:00 PM – I have been killed.
     * 4:01 PM – Listening to Complicated by Avril Lavigne because I’m
       kind of a fucking doucehbag. I like you the way you are, when we’re
       driving in your car, and you’re talking to me 1-on-1…tell me, why’d
       you have to go and make things so complicated. I used to have a
       Radio Disney CD with this song on it and that brings back some
       memories of lying facedown on the floor in order to get an erection
       (I was like 7 or 8).

[33]Video Game Ideas

     * Cheese Burger Bastards Of The Serbian Doom Village
          + The protagonist is a cheeseburger from a village of vampire
            people in Serbia and in order to level up you need to find a
            pair of sneakers for your landlord Wallace. Each time you
            level up the main character, cheeseburger, gets a better pair
            of denim jeans. The first pair has holes in the knees and then
            by level 5 they have both front pockets. When you beat the
            game after finding all of the shoes, the pants have all the
            required pockets and go past his ankles. It’s pretty cool
            because when he gets the last pair of pants he starts to smile
            because the town drunk can no longer call him “a needle-dick
            in capris”. Then the credits roll and you realize that you
            wasted $55 on a game that is less exciting than watching a
            washing machine function properly.
     * Dan Quayle’s Grand Theft Auto
          + You walk around Chicago as the 44th Vice-President of the
            United States, Dan Quayle. You aren’t allowed to obtain
            weapons, steal, loot or drive through stop signs. You drive a
            1992 Ford Ranger with no hubcaps. The soundtrack to the game
            was provided by [34]Men Without Hats , so you know it’s
            quality. The missions in the game revolve around handing out
            pamphlets to disgruntled Jewish mill workers. The game does
            not end until you’ve ended the mill worker strike. No one has
            ever beaten the game, so you’re getting a lot for $60.
     * Daunte Culpepper’s Hail Mary Football
          + The game is set at a high school football field in Arizona and
            all you can do is throw hail mary’s to Randy Moss. Those are
            the only two characters in the game, except for the ice cream
            man who drives his truck onto the field every two hours or so.
            The ice cream man will ask if you want a snowcone and you have
            the option to say “yes, absolutely mr.” or “what? a snow man?
            We’re in Arizona, silly!” The game will only be made for the
            PlayStation 2 so plan accordingly.

[38]Harry Potter And The Wizard Man’s Stone: Chapter 1 – Part 1

   I will be rewriting/remixing each chapter from the Harry Potter books.
   Why? Because I have no life and enjoy doing dumb stuff like this.

   Chapter 1: A Family Of Assholes Found A Kid On Their Steps

   Mr. and Mrs. Dungflob, of number 69 (LOL!), Penis (2X LOL!) Drive, were
   proud to say they were more normal than their neighbors, the Martins –
   a clan of inbred, compulsive masturbators from Leeds. They, the
   Dunglob’s, were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything
   strange, overtly sexual, mysterious, or shady, because they didn’t own
   a Buick and watched far too much Nottingham Forest highlights to do
   much else.

   Mr. Dunglfob was the director of a firm called Gunt, which made dildos.
   He was a big, slovenly lard of a man with hardly any neck or control of
   his emotions; although he did have a car his son referred to as “the
   dildo man’s gay limo.” So he had that going for him. Mrs. Dungflob,
   unlike her husband, was unemployed. Her neck resembled that of a crane,
   her blonde hair gave off that “God I wish it was 1986 again” vibe, and
   her peppy march throughout the kitchen as she made eggs every morning
   indicated she was eloping with one of the Martin men again. The
   Dungflob’s had a son, Dizzy Carl, and they accepted him for what hes
   was – their son.

   The Dungflob’s had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret,
   and their greatest fear was that one of their Vietnamese neighbors
   would break into their home during the Chinese New Year and discover
   it.

   They didn’t think they could bare it if anyone found out about the
   Potter’s. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dungflob’s sister, but it had been
   several years since they last spoke; in the parking lot of Wembley
   Stadium following a Sting concert. They argued over who would take the
   backstage pass and try to “meet” Sting. Some nasty things were said and
   someone threw a bottle of coke at someone else’s head. Real nasty shit.

   Mrs. Dungflob pretended she didn’t have a sister, nor a brother-in-law
   who was one of Great Britain’s worst Formula One racers, because they
   were simply too un-Dungflob. Like really un-Dungflob. You have to trust
   me on this one. I’m the narrator for Christ sake, cut me some slack.
   The Dungflob’s constantly feared what the neighbors would think if the
   Potter’s showed up in the street. They panicked at the thought of what
   might happen were they to tangle with the sexually deviant Martins. The
   Dungflob’s would have better off seeking treatment for generalized
   anxiety, but Nottingham Forest took priority.

   The Potter’s had a son, Harry. The Dungflob’s saw Harry as a threat to
   Dizzy Carl’s development. They didn’t want their son -an overweight
   male with poor eating habits, entitlement issues and a Napoleon Complex
   – mixing in with the wrong crowd.

   When Mr. and Mrs. Dungflob woke up on the dull, gray, seagull-ridden
   Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing bout the bird-ridden sky –
   besides the obnoxious amount of seagulls – to suggest that strange and
   mysterious and Vietnamese things would soon be happening all over the
   country. Mr. Dungflob hummed The Jetsons theme as he picked out a tie
   for work, many of which his son referred to as “the dildo man’s gay
   ties.” Mrs. Dungflob gossiped away happily, trashing the Martin’s for
   being “god damn weirdos with their dicks out all day” despite her
   growing lust for the eldest of the Martin’s; 87-year-old Teapiss.

   None of them noticed an owl sitting on the window sill, despite, you
   know, the rarity of owls being seen in Great Britain. Perhaps Mrs.
   Dungflob could have shown some fucking awareness, got her head out of
   her ass and looked at what I imagine was a suddenly darker window. That
   owl isn’t tiny, most aren’t. They’re not HUGE but c’mon, they certainly
   aren’t small. There’s going to be a shadow from the damn thing. God
   this woman fucking annoys me.

   At half past eight, Mr. Dungflob picked up his briefcase, slobbered his
   Mr. Dungflob saliva down Mrs. Dungflob’s cheek, and tossed Dudley an
   empty bottle of Coca-Cola, gave him the finger, and strutted out the
   door. “Who owns the gay ties now,” he mumbled as he started the engine
   to his car. He had successfully burned his son, and it felt good.

   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of
   something strange – a cat reading a map. He had seen grumpy cat memes
   before, so his first instinct was to look for a non-cat-creature, which
   he believed to be called “human beings”, to be holding a camera. When
   he was unable to find one, he became awestruck. He jerked his head
   around and noticed a tabby cat sitting behind the car, holding a map of
   colonial New England. A gust of wind knocked a tree onto a car in the
   adjacent driveway, so naturally he looked because he heard the noise
   and instinctively was all “oh shit, noise!” When he looked back at the
   cat, the map was gone. It had been replaced with a signed picture of Al
   Roker carrying a suitcase. The cat stared back. Shit was getting too
   intense for Mr. Dungflob, so he decided it was best to keep driving.
   After all, he had been sitting a stop sign for at least seven minutes.
   That’s far too long.

   When he approached the edge of town, dildos were penetrated out of his
   mind by something else – something much less sexual. As he sat in the
   usual morning traffic jam, caused by Eddie Piscatelli the town drunk
   who ran bare-ass across the freeway every morning because he thought
   Leeds United was a conspiracy theory, he couldn’t help noticing that
   there were more people dressed like those Hot Topic weirdos who tried
   stealing his car outside of a Lowe’s that one time. They were wearing
   cloaks, much different than their usual chain-tattered pants and baggie
   Slipknot hoodies. Mr. Dungflob hated people who wore cloaks, especially
   when it was worn by a wizard that he mistook for a rebellious teenager.
   Mr. Dungflob hated being wrong more than he hated his sons nicknames
   for all of his belongings, which began “the dildo man’s gay…”

   I didn’t realize how long these chapters are and will be splitting the
   chapters up into parts. This project is going to take a few years. STAY
   TUNED!

[42]Visiting The Dentist – Day 1

   [43]mailman062way

   My Dentist, Dentist Dan, has a pet in his office. His pet is a bull,
   and its name is Harold.

   Harold eats training sneakers and leans against the far wall most of
   the day, everyday. He strikes me as a complacent bull. I will
   investigate this allegation further in the coming weeks.

   I do not understand why my dentist, Dentist Dan, has a pet bull. I
   asked him last week and he told me that I was a bad girl. He then tried
   to tickle me with a toothbrush, but I declined his advance. He briefly
   left the room, before returning dressed as a box of dental floss. Then
   he tried tickling me again. It was weird. All the while, Harold was
   still leaning on the far wall and chewing on what appeared a pair of
   those prescription shoes for people with webbed feet.

   I did not have any work done on my teeth today. Dentist Dan says today
   was a preparatory day and that I should bring beach attire and a packed
   lunch for my visit next Tuesday. I think Dentist Dan is going to take
   me to the beach.

   Oh boy.
