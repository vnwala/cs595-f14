[11]With Twitch acquisition, YouTube might finally make live streaming matter

   Originally posted on [12]Gigaom:

   YouTube (S GOOG) hasn’t confirmed [13]this weekend’s reports that it is
   about to acquire video game live streaming site Twitch for $1 billion
   in cash, but I’d imagine that the news made folks working at YouTube,
   as well as many of the service’s publishers, very happy. That’s because
   a Twitch acquisition could help YouTube finally get a foothold in the
   live video space.

   Live video has been a complicated subject for YouTube. The Google-owned
   video service [14]started to dabble with live streaming all the way
   back in 2010, and gradually opened up the ability to go live to almost
   all of its publishers in the following years. But aside from a few
   marquee events, the quality of live content on the platform has been
   questionable. Discovery has been a huge headache, and efforts to
   professionalize live streaming have been cut short. At this point,
   YouTube Live is barely alive.

YouTube’s disappearing live…

[24]Cross-platform messaging service WhatsApp currently unavailable for
Windows Phone

   Originally posted on [25]Gigaom:

   One of WhatsApp’s(s fb) biggest strengths is that it is available on
   nearly every major mobile platform: messaging services work better when
   you know the people you correspond with can install the app in the
   first place. That’s why it’s important to note that WhatsApp [26]is not
   currently available on Windows Phone(s msft).

   While the app had previously been available for Windows Phone, last
   Friday the download link on the Windows Phone Store was removed and
   replaced with the message “This app is no longer published.” The good
   news for the roughly 50 million Windows Phone users worldwide is those
   with the app already installed can still send and receive messages.

   WhatsApp had not been officially updated for Windows Phone since
   January, and while its beta channel received regular updates, the app
   had major difficulties on the Windows Phone 8.1 beta. WhatsApp users
   running the operating system preview had…

[36]Here are the robots, drones and fire-spewing octopus you missed at this
weekend’s Maker Faire

   Originally posted on [37]Gigaom:

   The first thing you notice when you approach the annual Bay Area Maker
   Faire are the flames — as in, the huge steampunk octopus hurling huge
   balls of fire from its wriggling tentacles.

   The second thing you notice are the crowds. Last year, 120,000 people
   attended, and this year’s attendance was predicted to reach a similar
   level. If you think robots and other home-brewed electronics are a
   niche interest, well, try telling that to the swarms of makers who came
   to the fair to show off their 3D printers, electronics kits and even
   edible creations.

   But back to that octopus. Huge mechanical creations roamed the grounds
   at Maker Faire — everything from cars shaped like dragons to wriggling
   robotic snakes.

[49]Facebook details how it handles new form of hacking attack

   Originally posted on [50]Gigaom:

   A new Facebook (s fb) engineering [51]blog post highlights how the
   company is trying to counter the threat of browser reconnaissance and
   exfiltration via adaptive compression of Hypertex (BREACH) attacks,
   which security researchers [52]warned about last August.

   BREACH attacks can be linked to the security measures an organization
   might use when dealing with cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks,
   which target websites that have user accounts, according to Chad Parry,
   a member of Facebook’s security and infrastructure team based in
   London.

   In the case of an CSRF attack, an attacker can impersonate a user and
   trick the user’s browser to either send spam or steal information in
   the form of web requests to whatever website a user might have an
   account with, Parry wrote.

   While companies like Facebook could use a CSRF token as a marker that
   indicates whether the user is real or a hacked account, to prevent an
   attack, the…

[62]The Intercept decides entire country can’t be trusted to know that
America is listening to its calls

   Originally posted on [63]PandoDaily:
   mystic_somalget_final This morning, Pierre Omidyar’s The Intercept
   published a story entitled “ [64]Data Pirates of the Caribbean *”
   claiming that “The National Security Agency is secretly intercepting,
   recording, and archiving the audio of virtually every cell phone
   conversation on the island nation of the Bahamas.”

     According to documents provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden,
     the surveillance is part of a top-secret system – code-named
     SOMALGET – that was implemented without the knowledge or consent of
     the Bahamian government. Instead, the agency appears to have used
     access legally obtained in cooperation with the U.S. Drug
     Enforcement Administration to open a backdoor to the country’s
     cellular telephone network, enabling it to covertly record and store
     the “full-take audio” of every mobile call made to, from and within
     the Bahamas – and to replay those calls for up to a month.

   It’s a heck of a scoop, but it’s as notable for what’s missing as

[74]Facebook AI director Yann LeCun on the importance of emotional machines

   Originally posted on [75]Gigaom:

   Yann LeCun, the deep learning expert and [76]recently appointed
   director of artificial intelligence research at Facebook, [77]held an
   Ask Me Anything session on Reddit last week. He went deep into the
   methodologies of AI and deep learning, the best academic training
   for excelling in the field and even touched on how to deal with the
   ethical issues that will arise from the advent of advanced AI. The most
   interesting exchange, however, might have been about the role of
   emotions in AI systems.

   Essentially, LeCun argued that a system like the one popularized in the
   recent film Her is nowhere near the realm of possibility right now
   because of its deep understanding of human emotions, but that
   understanding of emotions is critical to truly useful systems. “Science
   fiction often depicts AI systems as devoid of emotions,” he wrote, “but
   I don’t think real AI is possible without…

[88]Fon’s crowdsourced Wi-Fi network spreads Down Under with Telstra deal

   Originally posted on [89]Gigaom:

   The “crowdsourced” Wi-Fi outfit Fon may currently be most interesting
   for the release of its [90]Gramofon social music router, but at the
   core of it Spain’s Fon is all about the number of users it has making
   up its global Wi-Fi sharing network. That number is usually boosted by
   major deals with internet service providers, in which those ISPs’
   customers choose to open up part of their broadband capacity to
   passers-by, and here’s a big one: Australia’s Telstra.

   On Tuesday Telstra, which is Australia’s largest ISP, announced a new
   national hotspot network, with Fon baked into it from the start. The
   plan is to create 2 million new Fon hotspots over the coming years by
   harnessing customers’ home routers, and through the creation of 8,000
   new Telstra hotspots.

   That means non-Telstra customers should get to use these hotspots
   cheaply while travelling Down Under, while Telstra customers who have
