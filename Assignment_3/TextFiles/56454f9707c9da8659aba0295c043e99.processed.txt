[16]The Cure For Your Songwriting Symptoms

   [17]Man vs Row

Songwriters are a sick bunch of folks.

   And, no, I don’t mean we’re crazy for doing what we do. (Okay, maybe a
   little, but that’s not what I’m talking about today.)  What I mean by
   sick is that we have a lot of aches and pains that really bother us. As
   a pro songwriter and teacher, I’ve had a lot of writers come to me over
   the years looking for a way to heal their pain.

Songwriter pains include:

*I’m not getting cuts.
*I can’t find good cowriters.
*Publishers won’t set me up with cowrites.
*My ASCAP/BMI rep won’t introduce me to publishers or cowriters.
*Publishers won’t give me a meeting.

   Songwriters are often tempted to treat each of these conditions as a
   separate illness, but I think that’s usually a mistake.

These are just symptoms. The disease is having songs that aren’t good enough.

   We can treat the symptoms all day long, but until we address the
   disease itself, your songwriting success will be limited. For example,
   we might be able to smooze our backsides off and finally talk our way
   into a cowrite with a pro writer… but so what? He or she will figure
   out pretty quickly that our songwriting isn’t up to snuff, and we
   probably won’t get a second cowrite.

   But if we write strong songs, it’ll be a lot easier to get a pro to sit
   down to write. And when we prove our skill again- in the writing room-
   it’ll be easier to get a second cowrite.

   It’s hard to think of a “songwriter symptom” that isn’t dramatically
   helped or fixed completely by writing better songs.
   Want your ASCAP or BMI rep to start introducing you around? Write
   better songs.
   Want better song evaluations? Write better songs.
   Want better cowrites? Be a better cowriter yourself- by writing better
   songs.
   Want cuts? Write incredible songs, which lead to more relationships in
   the biz which lead to more opportunities to write more incredible
   songs, which put you in a much better position to get cuts.

   Treat the illness and the symptoms become a lot less severe or just go
   away on their own.

   God Bless,

   Brent

[70]Don’t Fall For The Facebook Fantasy

   [71]Man vs Row

It’s easy to get frustrated by facebook.

   You scroll through your feed, and it seems like everyone in Nashville
   is:

“Writing a hit with ___ today!”

“Listening to new mixes – they sound awesome!”

“Just booked a show in ___!”

“Just got a cut today- wish I could tell you who, but I will soon!”

   And it may all be true. I try to listen to my better angels and be
   happy for the success of others, even when I’m not getting as many cuts
   as I want.

   But just remember- you only see what other folks WANT you to see.
   Certain people are going to overhype everything in an attempt to fake
   it till they make it. Others are overconfident or excited and really
   think every song they write is a hit. Others are so insecure that they
   feel they have to make things sound better than they are so they don’t
   get outted as the frauds they fear they are. Others are completely
   honest, but they only post the positive things.

All this can lead to the false impression that everyone is on the fast lane
of success while you can’t get out of the garage.

   So, how do we avoid falling into the facebook fantasy? First of all,
   don’t spend too much time on it. There’s probably something better you
   can do with your time, anyway. (Yes, I’ll post this to my facebook
   page, and I’m well aware of the irony.) Secondly, realize that the
   truth behind most of those posts is probably:

“Writing a hit with ___ today… and my publisher probably won’t even like it
so it’ll never even get demoed!”

“Listening to new mixes- they sound awesome… and every label will pass on the
song at least twice!”

“Just booked a show in ___ … and after gas and paying the band, it’ll cost me
$100!”

“Just got a cut today- wish I could tell you who, but I will soon… as I
google them because it’s some no-name indie artist that probably won’t even
pay mechanicals on the 1,000 units they’ll print, anyway!”

   While that’s kind of a fun game, don’t be a hater. But just as
   importantly, don’t let facebook make you hate yourself.
   Now, if you’ll excuse me… I need to go write a hit and listen to some
   sweet new mixes.

   God Bless,

   Brent

[121]Songwriters, Take Your Listeners To The Movies

   [122]Man vs Row

   Brent is a hit songwriter with cuts by Alan Jackson, Randy Travis, Lady
   Antebellum, Joe Nichols, Gord Bamford, Ray Stevens, and more.  He’s
   written a top 5 hit in the US and a #1 in Canada… so far.

   Imagine yourself in a darkened movie theater. The movie starts to play,
   but there is just sound… no picture. You’d be upset, right? Well, then,
   why do we sometimes write songs that way?

   I think the movie analogy is an appropriate one for songwriting.

After all, don’t we basically write 3-minute movies?

   Our job is to entertain, to move, or to make the listener think. Just
   like a movie. But because songs are an audio format, we sometimes
   forget about the pictures. But they are terribly important!

   Take, for instance, “The Thunder Rolls” written by Garth Brooks and Pat
   Alger. Yes, it’s an oldie, but it’s a classic. This lyric is a movie
   all by itself. Let’s look at the first verse:

   3:30 in the morning / not a soul in sight / the city’s looking like a
   ghost town / on a moonless summer night / raindrops on the windshield /
   there’s a storm moving in / he’s heading back from somewhere / that he
   never should have been / and the thunder rolls

   You can SEE that verse. The ghost town, the dark night, the raindrops.
   Not only that, but you can HEAR it. The thunder rolls. While this
   lesson will focus on visuals, don’t forget that you have FIVE senses,
   and you should use as many of them in a song as possible. Let’s look at
   the second verse:

   Every light is burning / in a house across town / she’s pacing by the
   telephone / in her faded flannel gown / askin’ for a miracle / hopin’
   she’s not right / praying it’s the weather / that’s kept him out all
   night / and the thunder rolls

   Again, you can SEE and HEAR that verse. Lights burning, pacing by the
   phone, the faded flannel gown, the thunder rolls. And the third verse
   is just as visual as the first two.

   It is no accident that some writers refer to sensory details as
   “furniture.” An empty room is not very inviting. It doesn’t hold your
   attention very long. However, a room with a great big couch and great
   art on the walls INVITES you in for a while. It gives you something to
   look at.

   I got this feedback from an old publisher when I didn’t have strong
   visuals in a song. He said it left him, as he called it, “floating
   around in space with nothing to hang on to. You’re just telling me how
   you FEEL.”

There’s a songwriting adage that says, “Don’t TELL me, SHOW me.” Visuals give
you something to latch on to. A strong visual or other sensory image at the
front end of a song really draws a listener in. It gives you a picture right
off the bat.

   Take these following first lines from some recent hit songs:

   Doublewide Quick Stop midnight T-top Jack in her Cherry Coke town –
   “American Kids” sung by Kenny Chesney

   Quarter in the payphone, clothes drying on the line – “Automatic” sung
   by Miranda Lambert

   Those high heels with that sun dress, turquoise heart hanging ‘round
   your neck – “My Eyes” sung by Blake Shelton

   Summer comin’ through a rolled down window, tearin’ down an almost two
   lane back road – “We Are Tonight” sung by Billy Currington

   And now a few hits that are a couple years back…

   Sun shines, clouds rain, train whistles blow and guitars play – “It
   Just Comes Natural” sung by George Strait

   I’ve packed a cooler and a change of clothes – “Want To” by Sugarland

   Driving through town, just my boy and me. With a happy meal on his
   booster seat- “Watching You” by Rodney Atkins

   I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house- “What Hurts The
   Most” Rascal Flatts

   She’s a yellow pair of running shoes, a holey pair of jeans- “She’s
   Everything” Brad Paisley

   I could do this for days. Now, I know there are examples out there of
   purely emotional songs that do well. But if you look at the songs that
   are not written by the artist or by the producer or by an established
   hit songwriter, I think you’ll see a trend.

So good luck with your songwriting. Use lots of visuals, and keep at it.

   What about you?  Do you tend to write with or without a lot of imagery?
    Are there lines from some other songs you think have great imagery
   that you’d like to share?  I’d love to hear from you!

   God Bless,

   Brent

[183]Are You Ready To Know Music Row?

   [184]Man vs Row

    If you have the dream of breaking into the music business as a
   songwriter or singer/songwriter, you’ve probably run into the following
   problems… or you will…

   “I can’t get a PRO (ASCAP, SESAC, BMI) representative to help me.
   Publishers won’t listen to my songs. I can’t get a second meeting with
   my PRO or a publisher. Publishers will meet with me, but they won’t set
   me up with cowrites with their writers. What IS a PRO, anyway? And how
   can they help me?”

   You can spend a lot of time guessing the answers or asking other
   songwriters who are in the same situation as you. The process of
   trial-and-error is really frustrating- you’re spending time trying to
   figure out how to get help from your PRO or a publisher when you’d
   rather be writing songs or doing something else that feels like you’re
   actually making progress.

PROs and publishers are an on-ramp to the music business highway, but we
often find the on-ramp blocked by orange cones!

   The day my PRO rep picked up the phone and called a publisher on my
   behalf was a big day in my career. He used his credibility and personal
   relationship with that publisher to open a door for me. It was a door
   I’d been knocking on but couldn’t open by myself. I ended up signing my
   first publishing deal with that same company, Major Bob Music.

On Monday, September 22, Man vs. Row presents “Know The Row featuring Chad
Green.”

   Chad spent 11 years as a Nashville Membership Representative for ASCAP
   (one of the three PROs – Performing Rights Organizations- in the US).
   He was responsible for signing numerous hit songwriters and publishers.
   He also oversaw the educational seminars for the Nashville office and
   created and implemented the successful ASCAP Writers Series workshops.

   Chad was also the ASCAP rep who picked up his phone for me that day.

   Chad has also spent years as a publisher. Currently, he is the Senior
   Creative Director for Daywind Music Publishing, where he oversees the

[204]Single Of The Year: Gord Bamford, “When Your Lips Are So Close”

   [205]Gord When Lips Single

   Hey, ya’ll!

   I just wanted to give you an update on my song, “When Your Lips Are So
   Close,” cut by Canadian artist, Gord Bamford.  Since it was released as
   the lead-off single from Gord’s “Country Junkie” album in September
   2013, it’s had a great run.  It hit #1 in November of 2013, has been
   certified as a gold single, and was nominated for two Canadian Country
   Music (CCMA) Awards for Single Of The Year and Songwriters Of The Year.
    While it didn’t win Songwriters Of The Year, it DID win Single Of The
   Year at last night’s CCMA Awards!  Congrats and thanks to Gord and
   Byron Hill, our cowriter and the coproducer on the project!

   With the win last night, I thought I’d re-post this Cut Study for the
   song.  Enjoy!

   God Bless,

   Brent

ORIGINAL POST:

   I’m blessed to have written Gord Bamford’s new single, “When Your Lips
   Are So Close.”  Gord is a hit artist on Sony Canada who is nominated
   for seven Canadian Country Music Awards.  If all goes according to
   plan, he’s going to debut our song on the 2013 CCMAs.  Today, I’d like
   to briefly discuss how I got the song cut and what you can learn from
   it.

I networked my way to the artist.

   I started writing with hit songwriter, Byron Hill, back in 2004.  It
   wasn’t until later that Byron became Gord’s producer.  Because Byron
   and I had written several good songs together and he trusted my skill
   and work ethic, he felt comfortable bringing me into a cowrite with him
   and Gord.

I asked for the cowrite.

   Byron and I are buddies, but he and Gord had a good thing going before
   bringing me in.  I already knew Byron pretty well, but I still used a
   patient approach to getting in the room.  It took months, but that’s
   okay.  You want to be persistent, but you don’t want to push too hard
   and make your contact uncomfortable.  You don’t want to lose the
   contact.

I did my research.

   When Byron said he’d hook up a cowrite with him and Gord, I got copies
   of all of Gord’s records.  I listened and wrapped my head around Gord’s
   brand- what he likes to sing about and his lyrical “voice.”  I also
   talked to Byron about what works well for Gord.

I did my pre-writing.

   I started an idea called “On My Best Days” and tailored it for Gord.
   Gord and Byron liked the idea and the sketch I brought in, and we
   finished it.  It was an album cut on Gord’s album, “Is It Friday Yet?”

I didn’t get lazy.

   Even though they cut the only song we’d written, I didn’t assume they’d
   call me up when Gord was writing for his next record.  Every once in a
   while, I mentioned to Byron how much I’d love to get back with Gord
   when he was in town to write.  After several months (and a couple of
   cancelled trips), we were back on the books.

I did more research and pre-writing.

   I didn’t assume that Gord wanted or needed more of the same.  I asked
   Byron what they wanted for Gord’s next album.  Based on what Byron told
   me, I spent a few hours on my own looking through my ideas and adapting
   a few for Gord.  I ran them by Byron, and he liked two of them, “When
   Your Lips Are So Close” and “Nights Like You.”

I focused on the artist’s needs.

   Byron and I originally thought “Nights Like You” would be a midtempo,
   but Gord liked it as a ballad- he thought it would really connect well
   with his audience.  Well, he’s the successful artist, and nobody knows
   his fans like he does, so I’m not going to argue with that.  (He cut
   that song, as well.)  We also worked to make sure “When Your Lips Are
   So Close” fit where Gord wanted to go and sat really well in his
   voice.  Thankfully, it worked out.

   So, three cowrites with the artist and producer, and three cuts and one
   single- I’ll take it!  (I wish all my other artist cowrites worked out
   this well.)  So, here’s what I learned from this experience:

   Use patience and persistence in your networking.  Do your research on
   the artist.  Pre-write.  Don’t get lazy.  Focus on the artist’s needs.
    Of course, there are never any guarantees in the music business, but I
   believe this process gives you a better chance of success.  Good luck!

THANKS!

   Thank you so much, Byron Hill and Gord Bamford, for writing with me and
   doing such a great job on our songs!  I’m honored to be a small part of
   your success!

   Here’s a writing prompt for you.  It’s a simple fill-in-the-blank. You

   genre-appropriate, or as imaginative as you want. The point is to get
   the creative juices flowing. And it’s a good thing to dig deeper, so
   don’t stop at the first idea that hits you. Try coming up with at least
   five things.

   “Dr. Phillips has the bedside manner of _____.”

   I’ll give you an example to get you started:

   “Dr. Phillips has the bedside manner of a prison guard.”

[272]Are You Ready To Join Man vs. Row In The Top 10?

   [273]Man vs Row

The listener’s reaction to your song is only as real as the characters in
your song.

   Do you have trouble getting your songs to connect with your audience on
   an emotional level? Do the characters in your songs sometimes feel
   flat, cliche, or vague? Do you ever wonder how some characters in hit
   songs seem so real that they leap out of the radio and into your heart
   while your characters often don’t?

   If your goal is success in the music business (as a songwriter writing
   for cuts, a singer/songwriter working toward a career on radio, or an
   indie artist wanting better shows and better sales at the merch table),
   then making your characters REAL is a big deal. If that never happens,
   odds are your career never happens, either. At least not as big as it
   should.

   Usually when a listener doesn’t connect with the character in a song,
   it’s because the songwriter hasn’t PROVEN the character to the
   listener. The listener doesn’t care about your character because the
   character doesn’t feel real.

The solution to this problem is usually imagery.

   When used well, imagery makes your character believable. Pictures are
   proof. Imagery gets your song past the listener’s head and into the
   listener’s heart.

   TELL me about an cute little abandoned shelter puppy, and I’ll be sad
   for a minute. SHOW me that cute little abandoned shelter puppy, and
   I’ll adopt it.

   I’m a lyricist. Words are my thing. In a town full of incredible
   musicians and great singers, I’ve been able to land publishing deals
   (Major Bob, Peer Music, etc.), cuts (Joe Nichols, Lady Antebellum,
   Randy Travis, etc.), and hits (Alan Jackson, Gord Bamford) as a
   lyricist. And a big part of being a successful lyricist is knowing how
   to use imagery to create believable characters.

On Wednesday, September 17, from 8pm to 9pm Central, I’ll be hosting an
exclusive online workshop to teach you how to use imagery to bring your
characters to life.

   There are only a few “Top Ten” tickets still available for this event,
   so don’t wait.  Click on the image below to find out more!
