[3]Desucon 9 NORWAY

   So, hi! You wonder what this is? This is my yearly post about the
   Norwegian convention "Desucon".
   I'm... so blown away by this year, that I honestly don't know what to
   write! We had thousands of visitors and this year, Desucon was over 3
   days. Well more like 2 and a half day, since it started at 3 p.m. on
   Friday and ended at 8 p.m. on Sunday!
   This year, I saw so many great cosplays and I saw two that I really
   liked, which was Blake and Yang from the American series, RWBY. I was
   looking for those two the whole weekend, that I almost forgot to take
   pictures, so that's why I don't have many pictures for you guys this
   year. Right, I was also looking for someone cosplaying as Takamina from
   the AKB0048 anime. I'm so sad I didn't find her, because I wanted to
   meet a fellow AKB-fan! So few of us her in Norway ;..;
   Anyhow, once again I was in the crew, but as last year, I wasn't
   security. I was facility, which is logistics and services together. We
   basically take care of the food for the crew and pick up thrash from
   the visitors. It's an ok job.
   Kay... Back to cosplays. I also saw quite a few crossplays this year,
   among them was a guy dressing up as Madoka from Puella Magi Madoka
   Magika. I'm sure I saw a few others, but I honestly don't remember them
   much xD There was also a bunch of League of Legends-cosplays this year,
   I got to take some pictures of them. I also heard there was a
   Tryndamere at the con this year, but didn't see him :/
   There was so many great stands this year too and all those artstands! I
   wanted to buy everything, but I didn't have enough money :( Ended up
   with 5 new figurines, a new poster, lightsaber umbrella (green) and two
   different pillows (one squared and one long). I actually bought this
   cute hat, with cat-ears on and some... long things on the sides, where
   I could put my hands. I ended up going around and creep behind other
   crew-members and make weird animal-sounds. Most of them laughed!
   Anyways, I'm still tired from Desucon so I'm gonna end my post here.
   Enjoy my pictures! :D

   Lulu! She had Pix too, but was in her bag at the time I took the
   picture.
   [5][IMG_0589.JPG]
   Man, I love it everytime I see Star Wars! And I got so jelly when I saw
   the Twi'leks!
   [6][IMG_0588.JPG]
   Aw, Annie!
   [7][IMG_0591.JPG]
   There was actually an 4th Ahri, but she wasn't with these Ahri's :(
   [8][IMG_0592.JPG]
   This is Tine, she's so fantastic! She's cosplaying as Retasu from Tokyo
   Mew Mew.
   [9][IMG_0593.JPG]
   Yasuo! My gosh, this looks good and this is his first time cosplaying!
   Fight the wind!
   [10][IMG_0594.JPG]
   Another cosplay by Tine, this is Fluttershy from MLP! :D
   [11][IMG_0595.JPG]
   I found another two MLP-cosplayers! Dis Rainbow Dash!

[29]I'm so lazy!

   Howdy! I'm really sorry that I haven't posted anything since mid
   October. I've really wanted to, but there have been a lot stuff going
   that have disturbed me from posting stuff, but I promise y'all that I
   will get more active in the months to come.
     __________________________________________________________________

   First of all: I have yet to complete DokiDoki PreCure, so don't expect
   a review or blabbering for that one anytime soon. I'm still on episode
   29 or something, so yeah. I've grown pretty much tired of the Pretty
   Cure-series and that is also the reason why I haven't even bothered to
   start watching the new one and I probably won't even start on it. Once
   I've completed DokiDoki and Yes, Pretty Cure 5! GoGo!, I won't watch
   anymore, since 10 seasons is more than enough for me.
   So, I want to say a few words about the current season of anime, the
   spring season 2014. It's a few good series now, among them that is
   worth mentioning is: Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san, Hitsugi no Chaika,
   Akuma no Riddle, Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season , Kanojo ga
   Flag wo Oraretara and Date a Live II. Well, those are what I am
   currently watching, including some other longer series, like Naruto
   Shippuuden, Aikatsu and the show that started during the previous
   season, Nisekoi.
   If you are still unsure what you should watch this season, I really
   recommend you to start watching Hitsugi no Chaika, Akuma no Riddle and
   Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san. The two latter ones contains a good
   portion of yuri! So if you like that, watch them. I can mention that
   Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san is only 5 minutes per episodes!
   If you want harem, you should watch Kanojo ga Flag wo Oraretara and the
   second season for Date a Live (you should watch the first season
   first). There is a strong possibility that Hitsugi no Chaika will turn
   into a harem series of some sort. If you are into idol-series, you
   should watch Love Live and Aikatsu. Both of them are on the second
   season now, though myanimelist have listed Aikatsu as one season with
   now over 70 episodes! But it's great! You should watch Aikatsu anyways.
   Anyone will like it. Some final words: If you are into "older" anime
   series, you should check Dragon Half from the 80's and Malice@Doll from
   the early 2000's. I watched Malice@Doll yesterday and I must say, it
   was the most weirdest and creepiest anime I've ever seen! Malice@Doll
   compared to series like Higurashi, Umineko and Elfen Lied, Malice@Doll
   doesn't have any gore like Higurashi and Umineko have. What it does
   have though, is some great 3DCG and good characters! Hey, thanks for
   reading and see ya laters!

[34]Updates

   Uhm, hello there. How's it going? Me? I'm fine, thank you.
   The reason why I write this, is that I want to say sorry to you guys
   who reads my blog and looks forward to my blabberings and stuff. The
   reason it haven't been much since my previous one (DokiDoki), is that
   I've been pretty much busy with gaming and I've started school now.
   Well, I'm only on school once a week: every Thursday.
   I know I promised the next DokiDoki blabbering to be on time, but I'm
   sorry I broke that promise. The reason is that I've gotten somewhat
   tired of the PreCure-series and I have an backlog of about 8 episodes
   on that series.
   Another reason is that I just haven't felt like writing and I haven't
   seen any series yet where I have gotten the urge to write a
   review/blabberings, which happened with series like [35]Another.
   Anyways, I could ramble on like this forever, but I'll give my thanks
   now and leave. (I WILL try though, to do a blabbering on DokiDoki 40)
   Here, take some vampires from Touhou.

[47]DokiDoki! PreCure, The Whaaaaat? Edition [spoilers 22]

   It's that time already where I write my thoughts about the recent
   episodes of DokiDoki! PreCure. What? I am late by two episodes you say?
   Yeah, I know. I've been a bit busy recently with a convention and stuff
   and I haven't been in the mood to watch PreCure lately either.
   Anyways, episode 11-20 have been a bit.. boring, but as the same time,
   exciting, especially since we got to know about the.. things that
   showed where the princess was. I forgot the name of those stones
   already. But the really exciting episodes was episode 21 and 22. They
   were really good and surprising. What really surprised me, was that
   Regina was not Cure Ace. Yeah, THAT surprised me A LOT! I really
   thought that Regina would be Ace, but since she's not... Oh well. I
   actually think that the princess is Cure Ace.
   Oh well. I wonder what will happen with Regina now. Any of you have any
   ideas? My idea is that if the princess is Cure Ace, maybe she or the
   Cure's will cure Regina and then the princess will give her Cure-powers
   to Regina? Well, that's one way to do it.
   All that I know, is that if the next PreCure-installment (if there will
   be one) gets a fifth Cure, I will rage quit and boicott the series,
   because I'm kinda getting sick of having 5 Cure's. My meaning is: two
   is the best, three is great, four is ok and five is a no-no.
   Anyways, I have no idea on what more to write now, so see ya
   PreCure-fans in the next edition~ (Please comment and discuss your
   opinions :D)
   [48][cure+ace.png]
   It's Cure Ace! I was like "whaaaaaaaaat!!!?" when I saw her and it was
   not Regina!

[62]Desucon 8, 2013 NORWAY

   Yeah, it's that time of the year already, where I write about the
   norwegian convention Desucon. The con was  for the first time held in
   Lillestr√∏m, at Norway Trade Fairs. Sadly, it's still two days. One
   positive side of having it at Norway Trade Fairs, is that Desucon now
   has a LOT more room. Norway Trade Fairs can contain about 9 1/2 Oslo
   Congress Centre, where the con have been held earlier.
   On another note, for the first time since Desucon 3 in 2008, I've been
   something else than security. This time around I was in
   the logistics-crew. I really enjoyed that. It was a nice change and I'm
   propably going to stick with the crew for another few years.
   There was A LOT of FANTASTIC cosplays at this year Desucon, one example
   is [63]Tine Marie (norwegian text), which dressed up as Spellthied Lux
   and Miss Fortune from League of Legends. [64]Elffi
   Cosplay, [65]Calssara Cosplay and [66]Kamui paid us a visit! Elffi and
   Kamui had their own workshops during the con and Elffi had a Q&A at the
   same time. Calssara and Elffi also did "Cosplay around the World" were
   they spoke of their experience of attending other conventions and
   stuff. I couldn't see that one, as I was pretty busy most of the time
   doing logistic-stuff.
   Anyways, there goes another fantastic Desucon and I really enjoyed
   myself! There was so much I wanted to buy! I saw a Makise Kurisu
   (Steins;Gate) figurine I wanted, but by the time I could buy it, it was
   sold out! I ended up buying 6 new figurines, a new Hatsune Miku-poster,
   Hatsune Miku-bag and a drinking bottle-thing with chibi Miku on! I'll
   post a picture of my new figurines, they will appear on the bottom of
   the blog post!
   Here, take some pictures!
