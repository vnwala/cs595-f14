[5]New Book Review: The Lost Notebook: Herman Schultheis & the Secrets of
Walt Disney's Movie Magic

   [6][tmb480_the-lost-notebook.jpg]
   It takes a long time to look through John Canemaker's new book  [7]The
   Lost Notebook: Herman Schultheis and the Secrets of Walt Disney's Movie
   Magic, and it should. Nearly 300 pages are filled with examples of
   every aspect of Disney's production: drawings, model sheets, camera
   setups, and hundreds upon hundreds of photographs of how shots were
   achieved, animators at work, models posing for animators, reference
   photos of animals and humans, cels, drawings, the Burbank studio being
   built, "The Reluctant Dragon" live action production, Bambi, Fantasia,
   Dumbo, Pinocchio. Numerous examples of Freddie Moore's girl
   drawings(reference for Fantasia's centaurettes), miniatures and
   models...from an effects perspective, but also just everything that
   clearly interested the compiler, Herman Schultheis, personally. With
   few exceptions none of it would normally ever be seen by the public,
   and most of it never has been-until now.

   One has to wonder if [10]John Canemaker or [11]Howard Lowery, both as
   knowledgable as anyone alive about the history of the Walt Disney
   Studio, had ever heard the name Herman Schultheis when his notebooks
   chronicling working life at Disney came to light some 15 years ago.  He
   wasn't a painter or  draughtsman, animator or story artist. His
   employment at Disney's was brief, lasting barely more than two years.
   In a time when so few of the rank and file of animation received any
   sort of public acknowledgment he was obscure-one man among hundreds
   working at Hyperion and Burbank on Pinocchio, Bambi, Fantasia, and the
   rest of the landmark output of that greatest of studios.  He remained
   unknown as the decades progressed and the films made during his tenure
   there became known as the "golden age', and historians, students, buffs
   and professionals who cared about animation learned the names and
   accomplishments of many of his colleagues.
   Anyone studying the histories of those working at Disney's at its peak
   finds an impressive roster of geniuses, misfits, iconoclasts, goofballs
   and self-made men and women, but even in that company Herman Schultheis
   was an odd duck. Ambitious, egocentric, tremendously talented and
   curious, he was in love with the filmmaking process before he gave any
   thought to applying at Disney. A man fascinated by details, he
   compulsively and enthusiastically cataloged everything he did, but
   especially everything he saw.
   Schultheis had emigrated to the United States from Germany in 1927 when
   he was already 27 years old. Initially living and seeking work on the
   east coast, he had, quoting from Canemaker's text:

     [A] degree in electrical engineering, a gift for photography, a
     thorough knowledge of music, and a love of travel".

   He was charming, indefatigably ambitious and without a shred of
   self-doubt. But as Canemaker points out, though talented(particularly
   as a photographer), Schultheis was indeed a "jack of all trades, master
   of none"-such a distinction then as now making the kind of
   all-encompassing creative and technical work he craved hard to come by.
   After various jobs in NY, he moved to Hollywood determined to work in
   the motion picture industry-ideally as a sort of uber-supervising
   creative engineer, to judge from his letters and self-promotion.
   Although he worked some very good connections, none of the studios
   could quite figure out how to use him and nothing panned out-until he
   managed to talk his way into a job at the Disney Studios on Hyperion.
   Hired to apply his skill in the Process Lab, he was paid for an initial
   trial period the princely sum of $40 a week. This at a time when,
   according to animation director Shamus Culhane in his memoirs,
   animation trainees hired right off the street were paid $50. But it was
   something, and it was a job at a film studio-albeit animation.

      Details of some of Fantasia's effects-incrdible information. This
                  photograph from [13]John Canemaker's page

    In fact, it was actually a perfect fit: Disney's at that time
   encouraged cross-pollinating between departments to solve problems and
   hands-on, "can-do" invention was encouraged to an extent that would
   soon largely disappear. But with films like "Pinocchio" "Fantasia" and
   "Bambi" in the works, there were incredible effects to be achieved-one
   way or another.
   And Schultheis, apart from his work in improving photostatic quality on
   model sheets, cels, and various other tasks, documented it all,
   compiling extensive scrapbooks using animators' drawings, model sheets,
   diagrams, and loads of his own photographs. What results is a wizard's
   book of beautiful, extensive setups of how everything was done. It's
   truly incredible.

                          [14][schultfantasia.jpg]
     Of course my jaw dropped upon seeing this page...Hello, Fred Moore!
                         Centaurettes in the making.

   The book is stunning-beautifully bound and printed. And although the
   scrapbook's contents would be more than enough for any such project,
   Canemaker has included additional examples of Schultheis' beautiful and
   fascinating photography to illustrate his story. The entire scrapbook
   is not only reproduced in a full facsimile, but annotated.  Now
   everyone can have their own copy of this eye-popping, historic volume
   to refer to it at any time.
    In addition, all the necessary context of Herman Schultheis, his life
   and times and that of the Disney Studio during his time there is
   described in Canemaker's typically elegant and sympathetic prose.  As
   beautiful as the scrapbook is, I was struck by the ultimately poignant
   trajectory of Schultheis before, during and after his Disney
   employment. Had he been a different sort of character, less oblivious
   of how his sense of superiority probably undermined him among his
   colleagues, he might have stayed at Disney throughout the war years and
   worked on such projects as "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea", or on the
   production of Disneyland.  That didn't happen, and the by-then
   intermittent adventurer "disappeared" into the jungles of Guatemala in
   1955; his bones where discovered shortly afterwards.

   from"Raiders of the Lost Ark".  His lost notebook, hidden away for
   decades after his death, was rediscovered by Howard Lowery and is now
   under glass and viewable via a digitized version thanks to its
   acquisition by the Walt Disney Family Museum. Also thanks to the Museum
   and the efforts of the late Diane Disney Miller, John Canemaker has
   written and assembled this beautiful book version for all to own and
   enjoy. It's a certainty that Herman Schultheis would have welcomed our
   rediscovery of his lost, and finally found, Notebook.

[32]John Canemaker in Los Angeles: Thursday 9/11 at the Central Library,
LACMA on Saturday, September 13: Gertie, Fantasia and...SCHULTHEIS!

   [33][hero719_animation-masters.jpg]
   It's always an event when John Canemaker comes to Los
   Angeles-literally. In 2012 he was here to present and moderate a
   program[34] honoring the work of John and Faith Hubley, a fascinating
   and wonderful evening.  Now in September we have an embarrassment of
   riches.
   This coming Thursday it's a double dose of Canemaker and author and
   author/librarian [35]Christina Rice, both authors of new books on the
   enigmatic [36]Herman Schultheis. They'll be [37]reading and signing in
   downtown's Central Library from 6 to 8pm, and the event is free.
   Then on Saturday, [38]a triple threat: on Saturday, Sept. 13th, John
   will be at the Bing theater at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art
   celebrating the 100th birthday of Gertie the dinosaur, discussing (and
   doubtless showing) the amazing notebook of Disney effects artist Herman
   Schultheis-now published in all its priceless glory thanks to
   Canemaker's new book, [39]The Lost Notebook: Herman Schultheis and the
   Secrets of Disney's Movie Magic.  Tomorrow I'll review the book-it's a
   whopper.
   Lastly, to compliment and demonstrate the innovative and jaw-dropping
   work Schultheis transcribed, there'll be a screening of Fantasia.
   [40][tmb480_the-lost-notebook.jpg]
   [41][fantasia_3.png]
   Presented by the Motion Picture Academy under the heading "Animation
   Masters"(and held at the Bing as the Academy's own theater is
   undergoing renovations through the end of the year),  this jam-packed
   evening will set you back all of $5 per person($3 for students), so
   there's simply no excuse not to go. There's no one I know of who speaks
   on animated film with the intelligence, authority and grace of John
   Canemaker. He's our preeminent historian, author and advocate, and just
   a great host besides. I've been reading [42]his indispensable books and
   watching him present programs for over thirty years and as is plain,
   I'm a big fan. You of the animation community owe it to yourselves to
   make the trip to the museum this coming Saturday.  Be there!

[50]Women In Animation

   [51][p.txt.jpeg]
   This Saturday, March 15, I'm moderating a panel at the [52]Walt Disney
   Family Museum where I'll be talking with [53]Claire Keane, [54]Lorelay
   Bove, and [55]Brenda Chapman about their experiences in the animation
   business, and their lives as animation artists.
   Last October the museum also asked if I would write an essay for their
   quarterly on the subject of women in animation, past and present, which
   follows here.
   In the 1970s there was one must-have for every aspiring young
   animator's bookshelf: Christopher Finch's oversized, heavy and
   beautiful The Art of Walt Disney.  Illustrated books detailing the
   history of animation, and more specifically, the Disney Studio, were
   almost nonexistent at the time; and at over 400 pages the Finch book
   was something I pored over for hours. I'd already fixed on the idea of
   being an animator, seeing it as the perfect career to marry my love of
   drawing, film, and performance.  I considered animation to be "the
   illusion of life": turning lines on a page into characters that lived
   and breathed in an invented world of color, design and graphic
   imagination.
   Every page of Finch's book was filled with story sketches, animator's
   roughs, background paintings, and photographs– not just of Walt Disney,
   but also of his artists working at their desks, drawing just as I did
   and looking not much older than I was. But they were working on such
   memorable films as Snow White, Pinocchio, and Bambi.  Decades before I
   was born they'd managed to achieve the gold standard: working at the
   greatest animation studio in the world on films whose influence would
   long outlive them.
   The old images fascinated me and I wanted to know more about them. One
   was particularly striking.  It showed a young woman, Retta Scott,
   animating on Fantasia.  While far from being an expert in either social
   history or 1930s studio-hiring practices, I knew that a woman employed
   as an animator in those days was rare, and that this had been the case
   from the beginning. The form of cartooning which preceded and inspired
   animated cartoons and newspaper comic strips, also had many more men
   than women employed in the field, and this disparity carried over into
   the new medium of animated cartoons. With rare exceptions,
   cartooning/animation work became a "guy's thing," though the intended
   audience for the cartoons and comic strips was both male and female.
   So, by the mid-1930s, it seemed that any woman with artistic talent or
   experience who applied to a studio for work in animation was limited to
   a career in the "ink and paint" department, doing the crucial but
   creatively stultifying tasks of tracing animators' drawings on
   celluloid and painting the underside. This was by necessity an
   assembly-line sort of job, and while the women who did it were
   rightfully proud of their skills, the work certainly didn't allow for
   individual expression.  But there was Retta Scott, engaged in what was
   a traditionally male job. She was an anomaly—a female animator!  I
   later learned that Scott had worked in the story department as well as
   in animation, and in fact, there had been other women assigned to the
   story and development departments, including Sylvia Moberly-Holland,
   Bianca Majolie, and most famously, Retta's friend Mary Blair, whose
   career and influence would extend further than many of her colleagues'.
   In the 1930s and '40s, a confluence of talent, opportunity, timing and
   connections were required for a talented woman to land a creative job
   at Disney.  This was also true for the men but to a lesser degree. It's
   impossible to know how many women who aspired to be animation artists
   were actively discouraged from trying, but certainly some were, as
   evidenced by the Disney Studio's 1930s form letter sent in response to
   women inquiring about jobs as artists. It stated that "women do not do
   any of the creative work in connection with preparing the cartoons for
   the screen, as that work is performed entirely by young men." While
   clearly untrue when one considers the placement of the women previously
   mentioned, the letter nonetheless expressed the company's attitude
   towards the idea of women artists in general.
   This was unfortunate since not only were women at the Studio making
   artistic contributions, their work was also having a positive impact on
   the history of animation. The work of Mary Blair, in particular, caused
   a transformation in the look of Disney animation, and the opportunity
   for her to create stunning art was due to the direct involvement of
   Walt Disney, whose appreciation of her unique style and sensibility was
   not hindered at all by her gender. But Blair was a stunning exception;
   for most women, the opportunities to achieve personal distinction in
   animation were simply not available. Had it been otherwise, it's
   anyone's guess who else might have made her mark as Blair was able to.
   Throughout my working life I've been asked the question, "Why aren't
   there more women in animation?" and I've never had an answer. I can
   only speak for myself and explain why I do what I do—a story that
   differs little if at all from that told by my female and male
   colleagues.  But while the question still gets asked, things have
   changed more rapidly in recent years than ever before. As a student at
   Calarts in the late 1980s, I was in a class where the guys far
   outnumbered the girls, and for the first decade or so I was able to
   tick off the names of all the other females who were somehow involved
   in animation.
   Now, there are so many women working in the field that I can't begin to
   keep track of them all– many working as I do in story, but also in
   visual development, animation, character design, and every other
   classification. Online blogs by aspiring female animation students are
   even more numerous, and from a cursory check, show ever-increasing
   sophistication and range in personal style and storytelling ability.
   It's a wonderful state of affairs for my industry and for everyone
   who's involved with the art of animation, and it'll be fascinating to
   see what the future will look like when a picture of a woman creating
   animation will draw no special notice at all.

[62]Magic! Color! FLAIR! The World of Mary Blair exhibit is opening March 13,
2014

   [63][unnamed.jpg]
   Is there anyone in animation who isn't excited by the work of Mary
   Blair?  Oh, probably a few misanthropes or those who go the contrarian
   route, but Blair's gargantuan reputation grows year after year for good
   reason. Many have spoken and written about her influence more
   eloquently than I ever could, but nothing beats seeing the real thing,
   up close and personal. To this end the [64]Walt Disney Family Museum is
   opening the largest show to date of Blair's accomplishments both inside
   and outside animation.  Curated by Oscar-winning animator, writer (and
   Blair biographer) and NYU professor [65]John Canemaker, this promises
   to be a must-see, and woe to the lover of Disneyana, animation, graphic
   art, illustration, midcentury design, and plain old genius who misses
   it.
    Here's a bit from the Museum's description to whet your appetite:
   MAGIC, COLOR, FLAIR: the world of Mary Blair features some 200 works
   and explores all phases of Blair’s work by examining her artistic
   development in three major areas: “Learning the Rules”—her student days
   at Los Angeles’ legendary Chouinard School of Art, and her fine art
   regionalist watercolors exhibited in the 1930s. “Breaking the
   Rules”—her artistic breakthrough with boldly colored, stylized concept
   paintings for classic Disney animated features during the 1940s and
   1950s, including Saludos Amigos (1942) and Peter Pan (1953); and
   “Creating New Worlds”—freelancing in the 1950s in New York where she
   became a popular illustrator for national advertisements, magazine
   articles, clothing designs, window displays, theatrical sets, and
   children’s books.
   The exhibition includes Blair’s rarely exhibited student art, which was
   influenced by the illustrations of her mentor Pruett Carter, and her
   mid-to-late artworks from the 1930s as a member of the innovative
   California Water-Color Society which reveal an essential humanism and
   empathy for her subjects. The exhibition also showcases The Walt Disney
   Family Museum’s extensive collection of Blair’s conceptual artworks in
   gouache and watercolor—some of which have never displayed outside The
   Walt Disney Studios—that reveal the artist’s inexhaustible creativity
   in design, staging of imagery, visual appeal, and unique color
   sensibility.
   In addition, Canemaker's biography of Mary, [66]The Art and Flair of
   Mary Blair, is now republished in an updated edition with a new cover
   and much-enhanced color reproductions.

            The title page from the new exhibition catalog/book.

   And there'll be a 172 page exhibition catalog in hardcover, also
   written by Canemaker. [69]Preview and order it here.
   A little digression here: in talking about this show with my coworkers,
   I'm disappointed to find a fair number of southern Californians haven't
   yet visited the Disney Museum, and there are also a few who aren't even
   aware it exists.  The latter I can't explain, but I have to ruefully
   acknowledge that as close as San Francisco is, given the schedules and
   demands of working life it sometimes seems that it might as well be
   located in Bangor, Maine.
   Happily for all of us this isn't the case, and I would urge anyone with
   the least interest in Walt Disney and the animation arts to just get in
   the car and go. I've been guilty too, not having made the bay area trip
   for several years until last November, when I attended a panel on the
   work of Bruno Bozzetto with Canemaker, John Musker, and David
   Silverman, and saw their fantastic exhibit on [70]Tyrus Wong. It was a
   one-day trip up and back, and absolutely worth it. The museum is truly
   an amazing place, and if animation folk want it to continue to exist,
   we need to support its mission and hopefully, attend its exhibitions
   and events.

   September 7.

[82]Michael Sporn 1946-2014 "The wind is rising...we must try to live."

                              [83][sporn.jpg]

   of "Raggedy Ann and Andy". Photograph by John Canemaker, from his book.

   Last weekend, thanks in large part to three consecutive days off, I was
   finally able to watch a few screeners. One of them was Hayao Miyazaki's
   "The Wind Rises", which I'd been very much looking forward to(happily
   subtitled instead of dubbed-always the way I prefer to go).  I knew the
   basics of the story-that it was about the life of the designer of the
   Japanese Zero fighter plane, Jiro Horikoshi, albeit somewhat
   fictionalized, and that as a result it was a more "adult" sort of film
   from Miyazaki-but that was all.
   The next two hours were a revelation. I loved "Spirited Away" and
   enjoyed the somewhat-contentious-among-my-friends charms of "Ponyo",
   but sitting through "The Wind Rises" gave me the same sensation I had
   watching my first Miyazaki films-"Totoro", "Nausicaä ","Kiki's Delivery
   Service", and "Porco Rosso"-the wonder of watching a graphically told
   story play out with absolutely no idea what might happen next,
   thinking, "I can't believe how beautiful this is".
   And one of the first things I thought was "I wonder what [84]Michael
   Sporn thinks about this. I have to [85]visit his blog(or as he called
   it, Splog)". But my first stop upon pulling out my laptop was Facebook,
   where the first post I saw was one expressing sorrow that Michael had
   [86]died.
   What! Died? No...
   Both Michael and I started our blogs in the fall of 2005; I quickly
   discovered his thanks to comments he left on my posts. Of course I knew
   who he was, thanks to [87]John Canemaker's [88]The Animated Raggedy Ann
   and Andy , a book that served as my introduction to Richard Williams,
   Corny Cole, Tissa David, the ins and outs of feature animation
   production, the animation artist's life, the history of some veteran
   giants in the business, and last but not least a great introduction to
   a gaggle of young artists just starting out-including Eric Goldberg,
   Dan Haskett, Tom Sito, and [89]Michael Sporn.  All that, and fantastic
   illustrations and photographs. It's quite a book(in my opinion the most
   honest and accurate about the behind the scenes of animation
   production), and though out of print, still very much worth getting and
   reading, as are all of Canemaker's titles.
   [90][The+Animated+Raggedy+Ann+&amp;+Andy.jpg]
   Of the young guys profiled in "Raggedy Ann", Haskett, Goldberg, and
   Sito eventually made their way to the once and future mecca of feature
   animation, Los Angeles. [91]Michael Sporn stayed in his native New York
   and started his own [92]studio-a studio that has remained in operation
   for 34 years. That's a pretty astonishing feat both personally and
   professionally. In fact, I doubt if any of the animation production
   houses that existed in 1980 exist today, or have for many years. The
   economy, changes in the tastes and whims of commercial production,
   dwindling funding for projects from PBS and other entities...all have
   contributed to a depressing attrition rate for independent-minded
   artists and companies. Add to all that the ever-skyrocketing costs of
   living and working in New York, and the fact that Michael maintained
   his studio and thrived is a wonderful thing.

                           [93][doctordesoto.jpg]
     From his "Doctor DeSoto", which was nominated for an Oscar in 1984.

   Michael Sporn Animation, Inc. did so much work, in so many styles and
   on so many different projects-television, film titles-even an animated
   segment for a Broadway show. There's far more than I can detail here in
   this post right now-but go and have a google. Recently Michael had
   started work on [94]"Poe", a personal project that looked fantastic.

                             [95][POEsporn.jpg]
                                 From "Poe"

   So I knew him from his profile in the book, I'd seen his work(often not
   knowing it was his)on television, but what I didn't know-until I began
   reading his indispensable Splog, was what an incredible animation
   historian, scholar, and fan he was.  I'd started my blog to discourse
   on animation's past, mostly, with a few posts thrown in on story-my
   gig-and whatever else. I've acquired ephemera from anything and
   everything that interested me, whether it came from Disney, Warner
   Bros, Bob Clampett...and I began to post these things I pulled out of
   my drawers. One I recall in particular was a candid photograph of a
   very uncomfortable Walt Disney, taken when he was testifying for HUAC.

                       [96][11+Sporn+%2526+Cane.jpg]
     John Canemaker and Michael Sporn in 2008 at an exhibition at MOMA;
       behind them are panels from Canemaker's film "Bridgehampton".

   This and other things brought comments from Michael, and led me to what
   he had been posting about.Ye gods! The man had amassed an incredible
   trove of material-all the good stuff, from every studio-not just
   Disney, but UPA, not just America's cartoon industry, but Europe's...he
   just seemed to have a line on everything. And he'd worked with everyone
   and he was interested in everyone. Believe me, his blog is filled with
   years and years' worth of priceless material-in addition to his own
   archives, he was often lent incredible stuff from his friend and fellow
   New Yorker John Canemaker. if you have any interest at all in animation
   history and art, do yourselves a huge favor and search his posts.
   Did I say animation? That subject garnered the lion's share of his
   focus, but he posted almost as often about life in New York, using
   photographs he and his friends took around the city. There's a whole
   book, or two, or five in that blog, and every one of them is a
   wonderful read.

                             [97][sfisher.jpg]
      One of many photos taken by Michael's friend Steve Fisher that he
                             shared on his blog.

    Start anywhere, or do a search via keywords, or read the listed
   subjects on his sidebar and go to town.
   Michael was opinionated. Honest, expressing his thoughts on all things
   including animation old and new in intelligent, often brutally tough
   terms. What does it say about a writer when you disagree with him
   vehemently about something, but like and admire him just as much or
   more at the end of some serious excoriation as you did before you
   started?
   In 2009 I was in New York and shot him an email that I was in the
   neighborhood. He replied immediately, inviting me to drop by his
   Greenwich Village studio. I did, thinking I'd impose on him for just a
   few moments. Three hours later I hated to finally leave. We must have
   talked nonstop about everything under the sun. I felt as though I'd
   known him for years. I'm so grateful for that visit.
   As is plain from a glance at my own sidebar, my posting has fallen off
   quite a bit since 2008. Some of the reasons for that are personal, but
   mainly it's been professional-the energy it takes to write the way I
   like to, on the subjects I want to, is harder to come by and I've found
   I've used what I do have on mostly offline pursuits. I'm always meaning
   to rectify that, but along with blogging less I also have done much
   less browsing-including, shamefully, two of the blogs I consider
   essential for their content on animation-Michael's, and[98] Michael
   Barrier's. Fortunately for me Barrier's is possible to catch up with,
   but Sporn's output was so prodigious that I'd dip in, look around,
   enjoy myself, and just never got caught up completely. As a result I
   missed the odd posts he'd made that (barely) alluded to his illness,
   and completely missed the few photographs that clearly showed how sick
   he'd become. The posts I did read were still vibrant, angry,
   celebratory, and as full of the joy of life and art as any he'd ever
   done.
   And yes, [99]he'd written about the Wind Rises, and of course, he'd
   loved it as I was certain he would. In November he wrote:

     With The Wind Rises he has made an adult film it’s the only way he
     could tell this tale. He also complicates the structure of the
     story, and despite the fact that he will not get the largest
     possible audience, he wants to be sure every aspect of the
     complicated story is told. This he does. He ignores a large section
     of the audience for the sake of making a richer story.
     His work on the two films, in my mind, can only be seen as the work
     of a genius. His story is as full as it can ever become, yet he
     disappoints a small part of the audience searching for the obvious.
     I can only credit the man, the artist. I also take away very deep
     lessons about his artistry and what he wanted to do with it. I’ve
     seen Ponyo half a dozen times with full joy. With The Wind Rises,
     occurring post Tsunami and post nuclear meltdown, I am sure he has
     plenty to tell me, and I will see it again and again until I’ve
     gotten all of its pleasure.
     Most prominently I believe he wants to be heard about man’s
     inhumanity to man. Despite all the natural disaster and chaos in our
     lives, he uses a man intent on carrying out the best war to get the
     full tale told. His method is enough to make me tear up, his story
     goes even deeper.

   A few days later he posted:

     Don’t worry, I’m not done with the blog.
     I’ve got some things planned and it could be as soon as tomorrow
     that I pass them along.
     I’ve had some weird stuff going on in my life and I’m just trying to
     get past it.
     Hang in there.
     Michael

   Those conversations I was going to have with him are going to have to
   wait a while. I'll definitely talk about "The Wind Rises", and probably
   thoroughly embarrass him when I tell him again how much I love his blog
   and work, and how much he's been missed.

[121]Books: David Derrick's new picturebook-tigers and crocs!

   A stack of worthy and notable titles has been growing on my desk,
   demanding attention and certainly deserving it but my gosh, it's been a
   busy year offline.
   So the stack waits for proper reviews, but there's one that has a
   launch party coming up in the Los Angeles area on Saturday, October
   26th (as of this writing four days away) at the [122]Wildlife Learning
   Center, and I'd like to spread the word. It's a picture book written
   and illustrated by my friend, fellow story artist [123]Dave Derrick:
   [124][jacket.jpg]

   ﻿
   Dave loves drawing, and he really loves to draw animals. This little
   story about a junior crocodile and tiger cub doing their best to
   out-boast each other is loaded with charm, done with gestural ink line
   and watercolor wash.
   ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿

                             [125][tiger.jpg]
    A detail of the cub. This guy suggests a self-portrait to me-in that
     way that certain drawings seem to look like their artists. Hard to
             explain, but I'm sure plenty will know what I mean.





   [126][spread2.jpg]



   [127][spread1.jpg]





   [128][end.jpg]

   The endpapers feature a panoply of the animals and birds of India, the
   story's setting.



   ﻿

   ﻿

   [129][launch.jpg]





   ﻿

   ﻿

   Using this flyer-either printing it out or bringing it along on your
   phone-assures admission for Dave's launch event. Should be a fun
   time!﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿

[136]Devin Crane at Galerie Arludik, Sept 5-Oct 31

   Where has the summer gone? For me it's been spent in a lot of work
   wielding the Wacom stylus, seeing films, and travel-my first vacation
   in 18 months.
   Meanwhile there's been plenty to comment on, take note of and blog
   about-including this new show in Paris of paintings and drawings by my
   friend, Dreamworks visdev artist [137]Devin Crane. It's just opened at
   [138]Galerie Arludik. He's shown there before, several years ago, but
   this time there are some of his lovely drawings on display as well as
   his jewel-toned paintings. If you're going to be near the Île Saint
   Louis in the near future, go and check it out-they really must be seen
   in person.

[148]The Imagineering Story: Disney's WED gets the Iwerks treatment in 2016

   Have a look at this trailer, premiered at the[149] recent D23 event and
   written up in[150] Los Angeles Magazine by Chris Nichols:
   [EMBED]
   It's being produced by a filmmaker with sterling credentials for the
   job, documentarian [151]Leslie Iwerks-granddaughter of [152]Ub and
   daughter of Imagineer [153]Don.

   This promises to be a must-see that I only wish weren't three years
   away. Behind the scenes footage of the early days of Disneyland and
   EPCOT always gets me as it clearly does so many others: seeing Walt's
   pitching skills at their finest, giving us "tours" and glimpses
   inside Flower St. buildings with mind-bendingly talented men and women
   working away inside...great stuff, and fortunately there are still
   veterans from those years that appear in Iwerks' film to speak for
   themselves and their experiences, among them [154]Alice Davis and
   [155]Bob Gurr.

                          [156][waltplanpark.png]
      From the LA magazine post-a shot of Walt with-is it Anaheim city
   officials?-taken around 1949 or so. My guess based on his appearance. I
     should know better, but don't.The article credits the Orange County

[165]A Blackwing Experience at the Chuck Jones Center


                             [166][jones3.jpg]
                     This must be from "The White Seal".

   Tonight I'm participating in a swell shindig down in Costa
   Mesa, [167]"The Blackwing Experience", arranged by [168]Palomino, the
   people who've brought back the title character of this blog, the
   redoubtable Blackwing 602, in new and elegant versions. It's taking
   place at the Chuck Jones Center for Creativity in Costa Mesa, an
   apropos venue as the 602 was reputedly Chuck's drawing implement of
   choice.  I'll be part of a panel discussing the "evolution of the
   creative process in animation". Quite a subject, and should be fun.
   To mark the occasion, here are the two drawings by Chuck that I own,
   bought for a few bucks at Collectors Bookshop in Hollywood in the late
   70s. I believe a Blackwing figures prominently here.

[178]Bob Clampett, 100 and counting

   I was just visiting one of the most important animation blogs on the
   'net-Michael Barrier's, to catch up, and saw he'd done [179]a lovely
   post marking the 100th birthday of Bob Clampett, on May 8th. Good
   grief, I missed it. Of course, every day is a good day to remember
   Clampett-that wonderful, nutty, brilliant and lovable cartoon
   genius.  Following is my Bob Clampett birthday post from 2006:
   [180][143257682_13680c8404.jpg]
   I volunteered to work during the ASIFA annual cel sale in 1981; Bob
   Clampett happened to be there signing these preprinted drawings; his
   wife Sody was with him. I introduced myself, finally, after years of
   wanting to really meet him. In addition to being a fan, I mentioned I'd
   gone to Third Street with his daughters, thus the way he signed this
   paper, which I treasure. All we spent our time talking about was what
   Ruthie and Cherie were doing--both their mom and dad were just nuts
   about them, so proud of them. I saw Ruth once after that, when she
   worked at H.G.Daniels, the old art store that supplied the old
   Chouinard school, then later Otis. Now long gone.
   I mentioned before that I've had a long relationship with the great Bob
   Clampett. It was 99.9% all from me to Bob and not the other way 'round,
   but nevertheless he was a formative influence on my little psyche. And
   in one of those bizarre details life throws at you, I discovered that
   two of my schoolmates at Third Street in Los Angeles had a closer
   connection to him--they were his daughters, Ruth and Cherie. These
   girls were very notable for their gorgeous red hair and
   freckles--perfect colleens...and I'd occasionally see them with their
   dad or mom Sody shopping on Larchmont(Hancock Park and its environs in
   those days was what an adult friend of mine, Cammie King, called "a
   little Peyton Place"; you'd run into everyone on Saturdays at Safeway
   or the dry cleaners. Small town L.A.).
   I was just nuts for Cecil the Sea Sick Sea Serpent as a wee--really
   wee--child; although we moved six times before I was in the 7th grade,
   I managed to salvage my Cecil soaky as a kind of talisman from my
   earliest memories.
   [145938067_085d0a4ac7_m.jpg]
   So I knew Clampett as a famous God of bizarre and cheaply made cartoons
   before I knew him as the director of some of the weirdest, wildest and
   most appealingly hilarious cartoons ever made at Warner Bros, starring
   another of my baby heroes, Bugs Bunny. That took a good while because
   the Bugs Bunny/Roadrunner Show, the venue through which I first saw the
   WB characters, was limited to later cartoons made well after Clampett
   left. I was probably 12 or 13 before I finally saw "Book Revue" or
   "Corny Concerto" as part of the KTTV afterschool series--the one with
   the cheap, handmade intro featurning a plastic Porky toy held in front
   of a backdrop of some kind. Great stuff and good times.
   I think Bob Clampett was nuts in the best sense. He was certainly
   brilliant, and different, and he managed to translate his own
   personality and essence so strongly and successfully into film and
   art--and at such a young age, that I'd also be plenty comfortable
   calling him a genius. He's the only person in cartoons I know of who
   can make violence and hysteria happy things. You have to see the
   cartoons--especially with an audience--to get the full impact of this
   weird melange.
   [145938983_499b9a87de_m.jpg]
   So happy birthday, Mr. Clampett. You're missed.

[188]Adam and Dog: The ineffable beauty of drawn animation

                              [189][dog1.jpg]
                       Drawings of Dog by Minkyu Lee.

                            [190][adam0130.jpg]
                       Drawing of Adam by Minkyu Lee.

   in·ef·fa·ble
   /ɪnˈɛf ə bəl/ Show Spelleadjective
   ﻿﻿1. incapable of being expressed or described in words; inexpressible:
   ineffable joy.

   One late night about eighteen months ago, my officemate and fellow
   story artist [191]Justin Hunt walked in with an animation sequence
   under his arm. It was old-school 2D, immediately identifiable by
   the sandwich of paper and cardboard secured with extra-long rubber
   bands. Here was something novel! Surrounded by cintiqs and working on
   cg films in studios where prosaic objects like pencils and paper
   are barely in evidence, just seeing a sheaf of hand drawn animation
   produces plenty of thrills-and I hadn't even bugged him to flip it for
   me yet.  When he did, I became more and more interested; the drawings
   were lovely. Just based on that one short scene I wanted to see the
   whole thing, though I'd have to wait a while. And I wanted to know why
   and how it was being done.
   It turned out that Justin was one of a small, tight-knit group of
   friends helping Minkyu Lee complete the animation for a short film he
   was writing, directing and storyboarding, and animating. And designing,
   and painting all the backgrounds.
   I first wrote about Minkyu and his film "Adam and Dog" [192]a year ago,
   just before it won an Annie award. It was in an earlier,
   slightly unfinished state at that time, but the elements that make it
   the wonderful film that it is were all solidly there. Now it's another
   year, and it's one of 2013's five nominees for [193]the Academy Award
   for animated short.  It's a richly deserved nod, and as I'm one of the
   corny ones who actually believes the old canard that the real honor is
   simply in being nominated by one's peers(in this case, members of the
   animation branch of AMPAS), it's already a winner, as are the other 4
   shorts in that category.  But this film is special to me; it pushes all
   my buttons, and I thought I'd have a go at explaining why. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿

                            [194][adam024.jpg]
        Adam, completely comfortable in his Eden. Drawing by Minkyu Lee.







     ﻿

   It's not necessarily difficult to make drawings move, but it can be
   well-nigh impossible to make them real-to live, to breathe, to exist on
   their own terms in whatever world the filmmaker decides to present
   them. The Story of Adam and Dog is simple, and all the more powerful
   for being so: The Fall from the point of view of the first dog in Eden.
   Although, being a dog, he sees and understands nothing so much as the
   joy of finding and bestowing all his loyalty and love on the first
   human being he meets and bonds with(and eventually, it's hinted, the
   second one also).
   What I've described has the potential for a charming story, and a sweet
   and clever short could have been made that was just that and nothing
   more. But-and here's the thing that's so difficult to describe as
   cogently as I'd like-in this case, this film has been crafted with
   every element contributing to a result that has the layered, emotional
   impact of the very best of any sort of animation, short form or long.
   Or any sort of film making, for that matter. What's called traditional
   character animation-that is, drawings and paintings in two
   dimensions-just aren't featured in this sort of style anymore, and by
   style I mean not just the lushness and soft, illustrative quality of
   its look, but the serious, thoughtful and truly unique pacing,
   the choices of shots, the editing. I think it was the pure film making
   that Minkyu employed that really bowled me over, beyond the visceral
   pleasure I took in seeing drawn characters inhabiting a believable
   world, living and breathing(the animation, by the way, includes not
   only Minkyu's work but also beautiful footage from James Baxter, Jen
   Hager, and Matt Williames, among others).
   [195][adam2.PNG]
   There's no dialogue, although there's plenty of sound-wind, rustling
   grass and trees, the shudder of various animals pounding through the
   forest or swimming through deep water. Dog wanders alone through Eden,
   acting in an immediately recognizable doggy manner: marking gigantic
   trees, play-hunting through tall grass, running and barking for the
   sheer fun of it-and none of this is played cute-at least, not by my
   lights; it's real and genuine. Dog's animation has no self-conscious
   posing, but neither is it "realistic" to the point of seeming merely
   copied from life. The dog goes day to day-or perhaps endless days, or
   an hour-alone, until he spies Adam-who sees him in almost the same
   moment. It's a more momentous exchange for dog than man, but
   eventually they become friends. The idyll of Eden can't last, however,
   and the dog must make a choice.
   This is a micro story directed in macro fashion, made big without
   pretentious allusions or grandstanding. I can't remember when I've seen
   something done on this scale, in this form, fashioned with such
   wise taste apparent in every choice.  Even after repeated viewings I
   still tear up a bit, not because of a piece of lovely character
   animation-something I'm always a sucker for-but because everything
   that's going on-shot choice, length of shot, expression, color,
   perspective. movement-combines to produce that effect in me.
   This is one of the things that I loved about animation when I
   determined to do it for a living; I mean specifically the sensitive,
   carefully calibrated story that is outside the mold one way or another.
   Or if done within a very commercial framework, manages to fire on all
   cylinders entertainment-wise while being a work of art at the same
   time, or, perhaps more realistically, having moments that satisfy on
   that level. This 15 minute short happens to be animated, but it employs
   an approach that at first viewing reminded me of Terence Malick (not
   surprising as it turns out, since Malick-along with Sofia
   Coppola, Tarkovsky and Godard-is one of many directors Lee admires),
   specifically the lyricism of "Days Of Heaven".
   [196][adam1.PNG]

    And this is from a workaday visdev artist, on his own time, his own
   money(the budget is small by the standards of any short of this
   quality),with friends' help, To serve his own artistic vision. The
   result exhilarates, inspires and shames me in just about equal measure.
   I'm just very glad he made it.

   [197][adam036a.jpg]

   I'll write a bit more with quotes from an email exchange between Minkyu
   and myself in another post. In the meantime, have a look at "Adam and
   Dog" if you can.  It's indeed an ineffable film.

[205]Para-nimation

                           [206][photo+(2).JPG]
   A model of the title character's house from "ParaNorman" on display at
                            an Arclight theater.

   There's a nice article about [207]Laika in the New York Times today.
   While not tremendously in-depth, it's a neat bit of context for the
   release of the Portland studio's"ParaNorman" this Friday.
   [208]Moving Ahead in Stop Motion/With ‘ParaNorman,’ Laika Aims to Push
   Animation Boundaries
   It's a wonderful and fairly astounding thing that not one but several
   studios are busy making animated features in this viscerally appealing,
   supposedly "throwback" technique.  At SIGGRAPH in 2008 Laika had a
   booth filled with puppets, sets and props from their then-unreleased
   "Coraline"; I could have stared at it all for hours, and the resulting
   film was a happy experience-different, moody, ambitious, and in many
   moments and respects very beautiful.
   When I was launched on the Aardman/Dreamworks production "Flushed Away"
   in 2008 I went into the conference room to hear a pitch of the film and
   get my first assignment. Before they began the directors, David Bowers
   and Sam Fell, put a puppet of a character from "Chicken Run"-Fetcher
   the rat-into my hands. At that point it was going to be a stop motion,
   not CG, film. Looking at this little plasticine figure in his miniscule
   tatty clothes, charming, completely solid and three dimensional, was an
   inspiration; I just wanted to see him move-to act.
   Artists have a tremendous soft spot for handmade things, don't we?

[215]"Art of Brave" Book Signing and Talk at Gallery Nucleus This Saturday

   [216][photo.JPG]
   This Saturday, June 23, [217]Gallery Nucleus  is hosting an "Art of
   Brave" panel. Present, signing and speaking-and in the case of the two
   esteemed Pixar artists, showing-will be myself, story artist [218]Emma
   Coats and visual development artist [219]Paul Abadilla.
   Nucleus, by the way, is a great space, and always has interesting art
   in its constantly changing exhibits and on sale in its store-often by
   animation artists exercising their creative urges outside of their day
   jobs. It's well worth a visit when in Southern California.
