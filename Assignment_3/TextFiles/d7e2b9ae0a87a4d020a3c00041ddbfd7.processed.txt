Welcome

   Jules Bennett We all have passions, right? I'm one of the lucky ones
   who turned my passion into a career. Writing has always been a nice
   escape from reality and, let's face it, sometimes we all need to get
   away... even if the trip is in our own head.

   My other passions? So glad you asked. I love my husband and girls more
   than anything, they're the only things in my life I won't sell for a
   good pair of shoes or a nice handbag.

   Speaking of shoes and purses, they are two more passions of mine. I
   feel I can wear anything if I have the right accessories. And, yes,
   books are most definitely an accessory.

   I love to hear from readers! Snail mail me at PO Box 396 Minford, Oh
   45653 or e-mail me at [18]authorjules@gmail.com and we'll chat!

   Happy Reading!

   Jules
