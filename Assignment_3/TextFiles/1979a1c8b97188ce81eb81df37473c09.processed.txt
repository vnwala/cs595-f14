Getting Closer to Elections!

   Please don't forget to sign up for the CDP/CYD/CCD State Convention.
   It'll be a great experience for you. If you go, you will get to observe
   the elections for CYD and CCD executive boards. I hope to see you there
   and get acquainted with you.

   Hop on board and support my candidacy for CCD Southern California
   Regional Director. If I get elected, I will create a far more useful
   and less difficult platform of communication for all southern
   California chapters. I will be the helping hand to getting your
   organization going and improve in ways you'd never thought possible.

   And of coarse, Happy Valentine's Day!
