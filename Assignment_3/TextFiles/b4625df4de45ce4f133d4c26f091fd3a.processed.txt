   We’re talking about sports this week.

   image

   I’ve been a sports fan since…well…since I was able to form memories, I
   suppose. I was brought up around it and it’s in my blood. No matter how
   frustrating or infuriating or absurd sports fandom gets (look no
   further than JD & The Straight Shot for peak absurdity), nobody
   completely shakes the things they loved as kids. My favorite sport (by
   a mile) is basketball, and that’s primarily what we cover in this
   episode. But any sports conversation inevitably turns into a
   conversation about how these games impact the atmosphere of the towns
   in which we live.

   Our guest this week is Gregg Gethard, a fellow basketball obsessive and
   sports fan. We talk about our experiences playing and following
   basketball, as well as a look into how a town’s mood can fluctuate
   depending on a team’s success (as weird and irrational as it is). We
   also talk about his brief stint as the Greggulator on The Best Show on
   WFMU and how much we’d give up just to be able to dunk a basketball for
   an hour.

   Gethard is a comedian, writer ([10]check out this phenomenal piece on
   Coatesville’s football team for The Classical), [11]Yelp novelist, and
   all-around good guy. You might know his brother, [12]Chris, who is one
   of the funniest comic performers working today. Follow Gregg on twitter
   ([13]@holdingcourtpod).

   Also in this episode, I stake my claim to become the University of
   Arizona Men’s Basketball public address announcer. Let’s make it
   happen!

   Greggulating, the band that shall not be named, and the things we do
   for love.

   Music is magic. It can creep under your skin, worm its way into your
   brain, and make you feel/remember things you can’t put words to.
   Tucson’s Human Behavior specializes in making audiences feel things —
   things they don’t typically feel when they’re at a bar watching live
   music.

   image

   In this episode, we talk to Andres Parada (the lead singer/songwriter)
   and Chris Pierce (bass) to find out what makes this band tick, as well
   as how Andy is able to address such sensitive topics (mental illness,
   depression, suicide) on stage. His music is stark, haunting, and
   one-of-a-kind. If you like Will Oldham/Bonnie Prince Billy, Kurt Vile,
   Father John Misty, etc., you’ll love Human Behavior. There is also a
   strong connection to the music of Daniel Johnston or Roky Erickson. I
   wish I could tell you more about it, but words don’t really cover it.
   You really need to see them live to know what I’m talking about.

   Lucky for you, Human Behavior is hitting the road. They’re embarking
   upon an ambitious American tour. If they’re playing your city, make
   sure you go see them. [[31]Click here for a full list of tour dates]

   Human Behavior has three full-length records (Golgotha, Eat The Wind,
   The Behavior of Death in Mower County) and a four-track EP (Sonora)
   that you can find [32]at their bandcamp page. It’s all
   name-your-own-price, so check it out — you have nothing to lose and
   everything to gain!

   for love.

   Typically, this podcast focuses either on Tucson’s local music/arts
   community or burritos. Billy Joel does not fall into either category.
   In fact, I don’t really have a strong opinion about Billy Joel’s music
   either way.

   image

   Will Stegemann does, however.

   Will is one of the funniest guys on twitter ([51]@BeTheBoy) and we
   share a major common interest (super-fandom of The Best Show on WFMU).
   I’ve always wanted to talk to Will about his
   up-and-down-and-then-up-again relationship with Billy Joel ever since I
   became aware of his blog ([52]A Year Of Billy Joel). In 2012, Will
   embarked upon a project to listen to every single piece of Billy Joel
   music in existence (official albums, pre-solo work, bootlegs, you name
   it) to fully confront his nemesis head on.

   Will HATED Billy Joel when he was younger, which is a sin growing up in
   Long Island. But a funny thing happened in 2012. This massive Billy
   Joel project turned into deep self-examination and an exploration of
   the threads that made up his life — family, class, his hometown, etc.
   At some point in the very near future, Will plans to put out a book
   chronicling his Billy Joel Experience. I can’t wait.

   Will is a wonderful guy to talk to, and this is one of the best
   interviews we’ve done on the show. I know you’ll enjoy this one.

   AS AN ADDED BONUS: Take your favorite Billy Joel tune and rewrite the
   lyrics to be about Mexican food. The winner gets a PRIZE! (no idea what
   the prize will be yet)

   fathers and sons, tonic, gin, feeling completely lost in your early
   20s, and the things we do for love.

   If you’re new to the podcast, let me make one thing perfectly clear: I
   LOVE living in Tucson, Arizona.

   image

   It’s not perfect (no city is), but right now, the creative community
   that has elected to make stuff in this town is doing a remarkable job.
   It’s a vibrant, exciting place to be right now, and it still feels as
   if the best is yet to come.

   This weekend, my wife Kelly ([70]@kellyhawke on twitter) and I took
   full advantage of what this town has to offer. We went to HoCo Fest Day
   3 to see some of Tucson’s best up-and-coming live bands and I’ve
   decided to highlight some of my favorite ones in this episode. Call it
   a sampler platter — you’ll get the sound snippets for free, but if you
   like what you hear, put down a few bucks at their Bandcamp pages and
   help support this burgeoning music scene.

   Like millions of other people, I grew up watching The Simpsons over and
   over and over again. To say it was “influential” would be a massive
   understatement. In fact, I’m not sure where my knowledge of The
   Simpsons ends and my original thoughts begin. This show completely
   shaped my sense of humor and the way I looked at the world.

   image

   That’s what we’re talking about this week. No guest.

   For the past few days, FXX has been in the midst of its Every Simpsons
   Ever marathon. Watching all those classic episodes again, as well as
   reading everyone’s tweets/reactions to it, has been a wonderful
   experience. I’m not going to list all of my favorite Simpsons
   episodes/quotes (plenty of sites on tumblr can help you out if that’s
   what you need), but I will tell you that any extended time talking
   about The Simpsons will lead me down a path where I talk a LOT about
   myself.

   So.

   Here’s what else we’re covering this week:

   • Sobriety. I’m not drinking anymore.

   • Feeling less alone in the world.

   • [99]Bedlam Publishing’s Loud Zoo No. 2

   • Kelly and I started reading Andy Mascola’s novels. Great work, Andy!

   • New Ty Segall & New Pornographers records. YES!

   • Hot rock shows coming up: (Ty Segall Sept. 3, New Pornographers Oct.
   14, Free Psych Showcase Aug. 27, HoCo Fest Aug. 30 — with Prom Body,
   Katterwaul, and other friends of the podcast).

   • Going to see Sun Bones at Che’s Lounge.

   • A Nick original tune: [100]Left For Good.

   Frankly, I didn’t know what else to do.

   This is the silliest podcast we’ve recorded in our 26-episode history.
   It’s been a very long week, and all I wanted to do was make a funny
   half hour. One of the funniest guys I know is Greg Perryman, so I asked
   him to be on the podcast. He’s the innovator of a twitter persona I
   like to call “vulnerably narcissistic,” but in real life, he’s just a
   super-funny, super-nice dude. We talk about rock shows, twitter,
   comfort, jeans, actors, Canada, being made fun of, and dogs. I love how
   it turned out.

   image

   I’ve listened to this episode four times already. Maybe I’m the true
   narcissist? Whoa.

   Also in today’s episode:

   • The lead singer of a certain harmonica-based jam band from the 90s is
   a human disaster zone. Do not tweet anything about him, his vest, or
   his band. He will harass you and your friends. He searches his name and
   goes out of his way to upset people, including guests of this podcast
   and friends of mine. It’s awful. Just trust me on this one.

   • I play the harmonica, too, but I’m not a jerk about it.

   • I talk openly about my dream to write sketches for Saturday Night
   Live. Unfortunately, my sketch ideas might be a bit too “niche.” Oh
   well, at least I’m putting myself out there.

   • [117]Tucson was ranked 43rd in a list of America’s Funniest Cities.
   We MUST try to do better than that!

   • Nick’s Family-Friendly Funnies and more can be found at [118]twitter

   Topics: Laughter, harmonicas, sketch ideas, gray jeans, how sock
   removal signifies the end of the day, sounding like John Mulaney,
   attorneys watching the detectives, life in Ottawa, President Interpol,
   Bob Log III, gravitating toward comedy, laugh tracks, dealing with
   things, twitter personas, friendship, and the things we do for love.

   Today, we veer slightly away from our standard topics (music,
   literature, burritos) to talk about the infinite vastness of the
   universe and how art can help contextualize the seemingly limitless
   scope of available information. image

   Yeah.

   Our guest is Jamie Molaro, a graduate student with the University of
   Arizona’s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. Her research focuses on
   physics, geology, and geomorphology of planetary surfaces. These are
   topics that fall a little bit outside of my areas of expertise, but
   Jamie does an excellent job explaining her research’s goals and
   practical applications.

   In fact, communication is a vitally important issue to Jamie. This is
   part of why she helped spearhead the[136] Art of Planetary Science
   exhibition. Last year’s [137]inaugural event displayed dozens of
   different pieces of art that helped illuminate the kinds of research
   projects taking place, while bridging the gap for people who might not
   have a science/math/physics background. It’s phenomenal.

   I know there are a bunch of artists who listen to this podcast, so if
   you’d like to submit a piece, go to the [138]Lunar and Planetary Lab’s
   website and click “Submit Art.” Submissions are due Sept. 19. The show
   takes place Oct. 17-19.

   Follow Jamie on twitter: [139]@the_bait.

   Also on today’s show:

   • There might be some background noise. It’s ok — you can handle it.

   • Our neighbor won’t stop revving his motorcycle. It’s so loud.

   • I discuss my favorite songs about space, including the tune "Lunar
   Kit" by our old pals, The Resonars. This song has been featured on the
   show before — it’s just that good. [140]Buy the album, OK?

   Hello and welcome to Season 2 of the SideStreets Podcast! We took a
   week off, but we’re back and better than ever with this week’s guests,
   the extremely sweet and cool Jordan Prather and Belinda Esquer of the
   super-cool Tucson band Head Over Heart.

   [tumblr_inline_n9walmQ6ZS1szsob5.jpg]

   Many of the bands we’ve highlighted on this podcast come from a
   neo-psychedelic/garage-rock persuasion, but Head Over Heart occupies a
   unique niche in the Tucson music scene. Their sound leans heavily on
   synths and dance beats, paired with 90s-influenced alt-rock and
   Britpop. Think of the catchier moments on those XX records, only if
   they woke up from their nap to put on some Roxy Music or New Order.

   • Find out everything you need to know about Head Over Heart at their
   website: [156]headoverheartmusic.com.

   We talk about the origins of the band, as well as how they’ve meshed
   their individual songwriting styles into this project that doesn’t
   quite sound like anything either of them have done before. We also get
   into their interests in the visual element, their stage set-up, the
   color purple, and the role Jordan’s cat (Chicken Man) plays in the
   group’s image.

   Their debut EP, “I Believe You, Liar,” will be officially released on
   Aug. 9 at Flycatcher (formerly Plush) in Tucson. See you there!

   • The do’s and don’ts at rock shows. Last week’s Prom Body show was
   95-percent amazing, but as always, a couple dummies trying to to dumb
   stuff.

   visual style, leggings, making music videos, being silly, teaming up
   with talented filmmakers, Head Over Heart, Chicken Man, and the things
   we do for love.

   Unless you’re Calexico or Giant Sand, bands from Tucson traditionally
   don’t see their singles premiered on Stereogum or their videos shown on
   NPR.com. [174]Prom Body is changing that.

   image

   Over the past year, Michael Fay has seen this bedroom recording project
   blossom into one of the hottest bands in town — both from a creative
   and a commercial standpoint. Prom Body’s sound is tough to pin down — a
   little bit of Ty Segall-style garage, a bit of Wavves-influenced punk,
   some ambient post-rock thrown into the mix — but Fay and his crew
   ([175]including our guest from Episode 003: Matt Baquet) have
   established themselves as one of Tucson’s most promising bands, as well
   as the ambassador for our town’s burgeoning music scene as they head
   out on tour this summer.

   Mike and I talk about, well, a little bit of everything in this
   wide-ranging interview. He discusses his musical background and his
   songwriting process, as well as his appreciation for how the Tucson
   music community has come together to help him see this project through.
   Mike is one of the most insightful young musicians I’ve ever met, and
   it was a real pleasure to talk to him.

   Prom Body released [176]Creep The Strange almost exactly one year ago —
   a collection of Fay’s bedroom recordings when he was living in Kansas
   City. These songs found a home in Tucson, when he put together a live
   band. For the past year, with the encouragement of [177]Topaz Records
   co-founder [178](and guest on Episode 009) Joel Leshefka, Fay has put
   every ounce of creative energy he can muster into his band’s second
   record, [179]Naughty By Natural, which comes out July 29.

   The buzz has been deafening. The single (and official SideStreets Song
   Of Summer) “My Paradise” was premiered on Vice’s music blog, Noisey,
   magazine last month.

   • “[180]Prom Body Should Be Your New Favorite Band" Noisey, June 16.

   In addition their single “Pretty Flower” made its way to Spin
   Magazine’s website.

   • “[181]Prom Body Share ‘Pretty Flower,’ a Bouquet of Garage-Punk
   Goodness" Spin, May 30.

   The momentum kept rolling, as Prom Body’s phenomenal Nika
   Kaiser-directed video for the instrumental track “Guttuggering” was
   premiered on NPR. Bob Boilen called the clip “jarringly beautiful.”

   • “[182]Prom Body: ‘Guttuggering’" NPR, June 27.

   IFRAME: [183]//www.youtube.com/embed/qJNClrHwSxk

   The biggest break came on July 16, when [184]Stereogum premiered the
   third single, “Vibrant,” for its thousands upon thousands of visitors.

   show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true

   The culmination of all this hard work happens on July 29, when 500
   limited-edition vinyl copies of Naughty By Natural go on sale at
   [186]templeofcairo.com or at [187]prombody.bandcamp.com.

   You ever have a conversation with someone so genuinely inspired and
   dedicated that it makes you feel simultaneously lazy (for your own
   inability to finish projects you start) and invigorated (to actually
   finish said project)? That’s how I felt after talking to Andy Mascola —
   author of the novels "Unmagnificent Lives" and "Who’s Afraid of the
   Virgin Wolves?".

   image

   Writing a novel — let alone two! — is arduous, demanding work. Andy has
   managed to follow through on these massive undertakings, while working
   a day job and being an attentive husband and father. He sleeps very
   little.

   "Dreams are worth pursuing," Andy said. Yes, they are.

   We also reference Robert Altman and DMX in the course of the same
   interview. That’s fun! Andy is the best — [204]follow him on twitter if
   you don’t already.

   Also on today’s episode:

   • Friend of the podcast (and friend of mine in life) Callie Rasmussen
   ([207]@cbRasmussen on twitter) was responsible for one of my favorite
   burrito stories back on [208]Episode 014. She checks back in with
   another wonderful burrito tale — Boloco (her favorite burrito spot in
   Vermont) hooked her up with a free burrito, just because they’re the
   kindest group of folks imaginable. Boloco gets it. [209]Follow them on
   twitter.

   • Our feud scout Cameron ([210]@cameron_durkin on twitter) returns
   after his hiatus trying to rid the world of Rob Ford. Today, he brings
   to my attention the fact that [211]1 in 10 American beaches are unsafe
   for swimming (editor’s note: WHAT?!?!). This is completely
   unacceptable. Get it together, American beaches — if not for us, but
   for Howard Kremer (have a summah!).

   • Fresh off the success (??) of last week’s segment, “The News Minute:
   With Stephin Merritt,” another musician has thrown his hat into the
   ring to become the podcast’s official news anchor. Thom Yorke of
   Radiohead submitted his audition tape, "The Yorke Report," and
   it’s…well…

   • [212]We love Howard Kremer at the SideStreets Podcast.
