What Mattered This Week?<----->The Supremes held off on the headline cases this week, but decided a bunch of others. Those are important, too!<br /><br />What didn't matter? I'm not sure that what happens to Snowden matters very much, I suppose, although I'm open to arguments the other way.<br /><br />That's what I have. What do you think mattered this week?
Catch of the Day<----->Kevin Drum's correspondent<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/06/its-amateur-hour-again-house-representatives"> asked</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">So, I'm just waiting for the inevitable piece from Ron Fournier asking why and how Obama and the Democrats could have let the Farm Bill debacle in the House occur. Or, how this demonstrates a lack of leadership in Washington, particularly by Obama. Or, how the leaderlessness of the White House is infusing into the House through some osmosis-like process and corrupting John Boehner.</blockquote>And the winner is...<a href="http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/21/19074847-first-thoughts-what-the-farm-bills-defeat-tells-us-about-immigrations-chances?lite">NBC's First Read:</a> "Leaderless in Washington: [...]&nbsp;&nbsp;Bottom line: Nobody is really running Washington right now, and the public is noticing."<br /><br />So I got cranky, and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/06/21/no-one-is-ever-really-running-washington-never/">wrote something here</a>&nbsp;about "really running" Washington and separated institutions sharing powers and the rest of it,&nbsp;but I'll add one more thing: no, the public isn't "noticing." Mass publics don't pay attention to squabbles such as the farm bill fiasco; they don't pay attention to who is up and who is down in the estimation of the pundits and reporters; they don't know, and don't care, about most of what people obsess about in Washington. Including those things which are terribly important to to their lives!<br /><br />Granted, if pundits constantly repeat that there's a leadership gap or some such nonsense, there's a chance that people will recognize the phrase and echo it back to pollsters. But for the most part, people just don't care about that stuff.<br /><br />At any rate: Nice catch!
Five Points on Farm Bill/Immigration<-----><div class="tr_bq">Yesterday, I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/06/20/what-the-farm-bill-says-about-immigration-in-the-house/">wrote</a> over at PP about "What the Farm Bill says about immigration in the House." I've already linked to Greg, who had a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/06/20/farm-bill-debacle-shows-john-boehner-needs-nancy-pelosi/">similar view</a>, and there were others, too.&nbsp;</div><br />But Ezra Klein has a<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/21/wonkbook-the-farm-bill-fail-doesnt-mean-immigration-reform-is-doomed/"> bit of a counterintuitive view</a> this morning:<br /><blockquote>Ill admit it: I dont know what the collapse of the farm bill portends for immigration reform. But I suspect the answer is: not much.<br />[...]<br />Will immigration go the same way? Perhaps. But its not a sure thing, either. Theres not going to be an immigration bill that all House Republicans are happy with. And theyre not going to pass an immigration bill because Boehner begs and pleads. But they might, in the end, pass an immigration bill  or allow one to be passed  because they trust the basic strategy.<br /><br />Thats not just the difference between immigration and the farm bill. Its the difference between immigration and everything. Washington is acting surprised that Boehner cant control his members. But we knew that already  remember Plan B? If youre surprised that the House is a mess, you simply havent been paying attention.</blockquote>I think there are a few quick points to be made here.<br /><br />1. He's correct that we're not getting new information here. We knew "the House is a mess." All we had here is yet another example. So in that sense, it's fair to say that close observers of the House don't really have anything new to say after the farm bill. It's less "What the Farm Bill says about immigration in the House" than "What the Farm Bill says about immigration in the House -- if you were just tuning in." Of course, lots of people are just tuning in!<br /><br />2. &nbsp;I don't think it's correct to say that there's a "difference between immigration and everything." Specifically, I don't think it's correct to say that House Republicans don't care about passing a farm bill. Yes, they may be post-policy, but the farm bill? I would think that a lot of them want that to pass.<br /><br />3. Which gets to an important point: it's one thing to say, as I've been saying that it may be the case on immigration that mainstream conservatives want the bill to pass but without their votes; it's another thing to solve that coordination problem. The same applies if their goal is to get something to committee and then let it die; there's still a coordination problem in actually getting that done.<br /><br />4. By the way: yesterday's fiasco notwithstanding, there's still every possibility that we'll still get a farm bill this year. It wouldn't be the first time something collapsed on the floor only to be revived.<br /><br />5. To the extent that the farm bill and immigration have any causal pull on each other, it may well be the other way around: if Boehner thinks he's eventually going to have to pass the Senate bill on immigration with mostly Democratic votes, he may be more reluctant to pass the Senate farm bill the same way. That's assuming the Senate version of the farm bill wouldn't get bipartisan majorities; it receive a fair number of Republican votes in the Senate, but short of a majority.<br /><br />And once again: I still have no idea what House Republicans actually want to do on immigration. They may well want to kill it. We'll just have to see.

Tuesday, or Not?<----->One of the biggest surprises to me recently has been the emergence of National Review as a location for some quality reporting on Republicans. I've thought of NRO as mostly a cheerleader site, but with Robert Costa taking the lead, it's now becoming a place to get information beyond what today's talking points happen to be. That's good!<br /><br />That said...I'm more than a little confused about <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/351534/tuesday-group-still-lives-jonathan-strong">today's item</a>, from Jonathan Strong, claiming that "The Tuesday Group, a moderate-Republican caucus long ignored within the House GOP, is quietly starting to fight back against the conferences right turn."<br /><br />The problem? There's really no evidence that House moderates are having any effect at all. In the article, I mean. Typical anecdote:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Tuesday Group members will get up in a [meeting of the Republican caucus] and express a point of view and basically, the leaders listen to them, but everybody else sort of tunes out, said former representative Steven LaTourette of Ohio, now the president of the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership.</blockquote>It goes on like that, reporting on several recent skirmishes that the moderates lost; there's really nothing at all about any successes.<br /><br />So what's the deal here? Strong noticed the existence of the Tuesday Group, thought there might be a story there, reported it out and found nothing but was already committed to a point of view? Some unexpected editorial decision from NR to show tolerance by throwing a bone to moderates? There really is some sort of resurgence of the moderates -- who, after all, have just as much ability to sink a GOP-only bill in the House as the Gohmert-Bachmann group -- but Strong didn't quite come up with the stories to convince us?<br /><br />I'll admit: I'm puzzled. Interested, but puzzled.
The Future of the Real IRS Scandal!<----->I saw this from <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/06/conspiracy-theory-update-irs-stole-election-mitt-romney">Kevin Drum</a>, who sent me to <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/06/20/irs_scandal_bizarre_theory_asks_whether_the_tea_party_targeting_moved_millions.html">Dave Weigel</a>, and from there to a brilliant paper designed to fuel infinite resentment for conservatives, summarized by&nbsp;James Pethokoukis <a href="http://www.aei.org/article/economics/yes-irs-harassment-blunted-the-tea-party-ground-game/">beginning with this gem</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">1. Lets say Tea Party groups had continued to grow at the pace seen in 2009 and 2010.</blockquote>And ending with the conclusion that the Democrats stole the 2012 election by suppressing the Tea Party vote by foot-dragging on certifying their tax-exempt status.<br /><br />To which my first reaction is: that's nothing! Of course we should assume that Tea Party groups would naturally group in Years Three and Four the way they grew in Years One and Two. And we should further assume that they should grow in Years Five and Six at that same rate, too -- so we're probably talking about them pretty much reaching 60% of the electorate by 2014, and 80% by 2016, and well over 200% of the electorate by the 2020 elections. Of course that's what we should assume! By that logic, it's pretty obvious that by the end of the decade Republicans would have easily had at least 90 Senators and 400 Members of the House, not to mention well over 450 electoral votes in the presidential elections. Anything else is clear evidence of stolen elections!<br /><br />And of course that was only stifled by the insidious IRS plot. Never mind, as Weigel notes, that the real heavy Tea Party lifting was by already-established tax-exempts; never mind also, as Drum notes, that back in the real world the Tea Party was never very popular outside of the Republican core and, by 2011, was quite unpopular with most voters. All that would have been totally completely different if a whole bunch of small, local, groups had been properly equipped with prompt approval of their tax status.<br /><br />At any rate, my other favorite part of this particular conspiracy is <a href="http://www.aei.org/article/economics/yes-irs-harassment-blunted-the-tea-party-ground-game/">this from one of the study's coauthors</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The Tea Party movements huge success was not the result of a few days of work by an elected official or two, but involved activists all over the country who spent the year and a half leading up to the midterm elections volunteering, organizing, donating, and rallying. Much of these grassroots activities were centered around 501(c)4s, which according to our research were an important component of the Tea Party movement and its rise.  Unfortunately for Republicans, the IRS slowed Tea Party growth before the 2012 election.</blockquote>Got it? The complaint is that the IRS was slow in granting all these groups a tax status that depending on them not being primarily devoting to electioneering, thus preventing them from..."volunteering, organizing, donating, and rallying" for the "midterm elections."<br /><br />I mean, as far as I can see (and I only read co-author Stan Veuger's summary post, not the whole paper) the entire thing is premised on a "constitutional right" for these groups to get tax-exempt status so that they can do things they aren't supposed to do with that tax-exempt status. And there's not even a pause to explain why some might see something amiss in that.<br /><br />As I've been saying for some time: they're not even trying.

June 19, 1973<----->Everyone is still waiting for John Dean's public testimony to the Senate Watergate Committee, postponed now until later in the month.<br /><br /><a name="more"></a><br /><br />The conversations in the Oval Office are less newsy now; Richard Nixon is no longer talking to his co-conspirators, but to a new staff who (as far as we know) don't realize how involved he was in the cover-up and the White House horrors before that. Typically, Nixon proclaims his innocence, and rails against Dean, or against Archibald Cox. This morning, he meets with Haig, Ziegler, and Buzhardt, who is essentially acting as his lead defense attorney.<br /><br />--<br /><br />President Nixon: [...] One thing I was, noted this morning was that, oh, that fucking shocking statement by Scott, I mean Cox. Good God, that, uh, now look here [...] But that was an ugly shocking thing.<br /><br />Haig: It really was.<br /><br />President Nixon: Because, first, it's wrong, as far as the Constitution; it's partisan...[C]an the President be subpoenaed or indicted, Jesus Christ, he knows better than that....Well, he's highly partisan.<br /><br />Buzhardt: He's a highly partisan fella and he's gonna play it political.<br /><br />President Nixon: Yeah.<br /><br />Buzhardt: Because he knows he can't subpoena the President; he knows he can't indict the President; but he's gonna play this game quite opposite.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Buzhardt: ...[H]e [Elliot Richardson] cannot allow this fella, for the sake of everybody in government, to think that this fella has a hunting license as a Kennedy advocate to go after Republicans any way he can, and the President in particular. ... [After the Ervin hearings conclude], then we meet him [Cox] head-on. And we just blast the fire out of him. That's the only thing we can do. But if we come out of the hearings in good shape, and I believe we will, and the public's gonna be fed up with it at that point. I think, I think at that point, Mr. Cox is gonna reach the point where he's gonna have a very difficult time getting the press to attend his press conferences. It's just not gonna be that kind of news. It's all gonna be re-hash and by that time, I hope we'll have the Committee with enough information on Democrat financing...<br /><br />President Nixon: I wouldn't anticipate it that much. [...]<br /><br />--<br /><br />And more false bravado:<br /><br />--<br /><br />Buzhardt: If he [Howard Baker] sees that Dean is beginning to crumble, if he sees that he's beginning to look bad, then, yes, I anticipate he'll jump on with both feet...I'm convinced that [Dean will]...convict himself.<br /><br />President Nixon: Really?<br /><br />Buzhardt: Yes, sir. As a lar, and we'll give him all the help we can.<br /><br />President Nixon: As a lar, huh.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Buzhardt and Haig at this point are putting their hopes on Dean's weaknesses, particularly a story in the press about Dean "borrowing" $14,000 from the campaign for personal expenses, leaving an IOU in a safe but without telling anyone. The problem is that Buzhardt and Haig believe that Dean's main story will be full of lies, because Nixon has told them that; the president, however, knows that Dean can be devastating while sticking to the truth. Meanwhile, Buzhardt is preparing questions for committee minority counsel Fred Thompson, for the Republicans to use to cross-examine Dean. But Howard Baker isn't acting as a solid partisan ally, which means the committee as a whole is badly slanted against Nixon.<br /><br />Realistically, however, there's just very little they can do at this point, other than to assume that whatever people think of Richard Nixon and John Dean, if it ultimately comes down to choosing who to believe then no one is going to want to bring down the President of the United States based on one man's claims without proof. And of those still in the White House, only the president knows that Dean is telling the truth -- and there is firm evidence to prove it.
Today's Lesson in Why One Shouldn't Trust Self-Identified "Independents"<-----><div class="tr_bq"><a href="http://politicalwire.com/archives/2013/06/19/extra_bonus_quote_of_the_day.html">Sean Hannity</a>: "I'm not a Republican, though people often mistake me for one."</div><br />(From Political Wire, quoted from a Playboy interview I'm not going to click through to read).<br /><br />Or, <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/2009/12/17/three_myths_about_political_in/">to quote John Sides</a>:<br /><blockquote>The three myths [about independents] are:<br /><br />1) Independents are the largest partisan group.<br /><br />2) Independents are actually independent.<br /><br />3) Change in the opinions of independents is always consequential.</blockquote>Sean Hannity is perfectly free to call himself whatever he wants. But he is obviously a functional Republican.<br /><br />Keep this in mind the next time someone tells you about how independents are a huge group of voters. For whatever reason, our political culture values calling oneself "independent," and discourages people from identifying themselves as party regulars -- if you ask people whether they vote the candidate or the party, an overwhelming majority will go with "candidate."<br /><br />Our political behavior, on the other hand, demonstrates considerably partisan behavior -- most of us, most of the time, do in fact for party, not candidate.<br /><br />All of which is not only very familiar to anyone who has studied the evidence, but should be obvious to anyone who listens to political actors talk.<br /><br />A reminder of my good-enough way of thinking about how the actual electorate breaks down: it's one-third Republican, one-third Democratic, one-third independent...but that final one third is itself really one-third Republican, one-third Democratic, and one-third (and thus one-ninth overall) true independent. And what's more, those true independents are overwhelmingly the least informed and least attentive to politics; the stereotyped careful independent who carefully reads up on the issues and the candidates in order to make up her mind does exist, but she's a tiny, tiny, party of the electorate (I've never seen numbers, but I'm guessing some fraction of one percent).
No One Cares About the Deficit, Latest Chapter<----->The CBO says: <a href="http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/44346-Immigration.pdf">the Senate immigration bill lowers the deficit</a>&nbsp;(see also a <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/06/19/cbo_score_of_immigration_bill.html">nice explainer</a> from pro-immigration analyst Matt Yglesias).<br /><br />Liberals who support immigration reform have been having fun since yesterday afternoon pointing out that Republicans who oppose immigration are hypocrites because they will surely ignore or dismiss that effect on what is supposedly one of their main priorities. Well, yes -- but I have very little problem with hypocrisy in general, and even less on this "gotcha" kind. Truth is that immigration policy is terribly important to determining what kind of nation you're going to have; if it increases or decreases the deficit a bit, that's really no reason to support or oppose the policy. And $200B or so over ten years is really nothing to get all excited about. It's more the other way around: anyone who claims to care about deficits would have some obligation to change the bill if the estimates had come back the other way; finding that there's a bit of deficit reduction certainly doesn't oblige people otherwise concerned about deficits to support the bill.<br /><br />Ah, but there's one group which really should weigh in: the professional deficit scolds. Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, for example. That is, they should weigh in if they really want people to take them seriously.<br /><br />First of all, they (and anyone else whose primary political project is deficit reduction) should be out there backing up the CBO estimates. It's not their job to say that anyone who cares about deficit reduction should vote for the immigration bill, but it is their job -- if they really care about deficit reduction -- to do whatever they can to establish the idea that CBO projections are real, and should be treated as real.<br /><br />(That's assuming, of course, that they agree with CBO; if not, it's their obligation to do a serious nonpartisan critique).<br /><br />Second, they should be quick to praise those who propose major legislation that helps the deficit. Not the bill itself; again, even deficit scolds shouldn't be suggesting that people support or oppose major substantive legislation because of relatively minor deficit reduction. But there's little reward out there for what deficit scolds certainly should be thinking of as acting responsibly -- the difference, in other words, between Bush-era Medicare expansion and Obama-era ACA. Indeed, that could be especially helpful for deficit-scolds who oppose a bill: "I'm against this, but the authors deserve considerable credit for doing it in a fiscally responsible way."<br /><br />In fact, however, most deficit scolds typically do no such thing. Which is why no one should take most of them seriously on deficits. And why many who otherwise would be sympathetic to their supposed cause wind up thinking that their real goals have little to do with deficits and debt.

Politico? Why Not?<----->There's an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/113489/john-f-harris-jim-vandehei-interview-talking-politicos-editors">interview</a> of Politico's maestros over at TNR which, to tell the truth, I haven't read yet, but it's causing a bit of a fuss -- Politico and the normally sensible Nate Silver are <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/nate-silver-politico-co-founders-lack-curiosity-for">feuding a bit</a>, for example, mainly (as far as I can tell) because Politico likes to take silly swipes at Silver.<br /><br />But at any rate, I like<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2013_06/for_those_who_cant_get_enough045338.php"> what Ed Kilgore says about Politico</a> (his emphasis):<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Regular readers know that Im not a Politico-hater; I think the site serves a legitimate reporting function and sometimes does it well and other times at least covers a lot of landscape that might otherwise escape attention. Its when Politico tells us <i>what it all means</i> or tries self-consciously to <i>drive narratives</i> that it gets into trouble, often to the point of self-parody.</blockquote>Silver is upset that Politico's style "seem to lack very much curiosity for the world outside of the bubble." I disagree! Kilgore is correct here: what they can do, and sometimes do extremely well, is to let us know what insiders are thinking and doing. That's good enough.<br /><br />Moreover, careful readers can often ignore the "what it all means" nonsense.The only thing I do worry about is when reporters, whether Politico or elsewhere, put that "what it all means" junk into the mouths of insiders who really are just worried about how to get from point A to point B. But if it's the insiders themselves who believe hocus-pocus and flim-flam, well, it's helpful to know that.<br /><br />I'll go back to one of my favorite things -- that the McLaughlin Group promised (or perhaps still promises) "inside opinions and forecasts," and delivered exactly that. Not wise opinions or accurate forecasts -- but they didn't promise those!<br /><br />I'll tie this all back to immigration...right now I've been arguing the key to immigration is whether mainstream conservatives in the House want it to pass, and that will depend on how they balance out what's good for the party and what's good for them personally. For that, I'd much rather know what Republicans perceive about the electoral effects of passing immigration reform, rather than a good study by a political scientist about the <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/2013/06/16/do-anti-immigration-stances-cost-the-gop-votes-from-latinos/">actual effects of immigration reform</a>. And since I'm a careful reader, I don't really care whether reporters mistake House GOP perceptions for reality -- because for this particular question, I want to be in the heads of those Members, and I'm perfectly capable of removing myself from that if I have some other question I want to answer.<br /><br />Again, as long as they keep their own analysis out of the helpful information they are collecting, I'm all for Politco-style reporting. I'm pretty sure the result is that we know a fair amount more than we used to about what's going on in Washington, and that's a plus -- no matter how much nonsense we have to ignore to get to it.
Please, More Reporting Like This (Judges ed.)<----->Fascinating parenthetical in Emily Heil's <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/post/senate-finds-pace-on-judicial-nominees/2013/06/18/fe9c5b56-d75b-11e2-a9f2-42ee3912ae0e_blog.html">story about judicial vacancies</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Some vacancies have remained without nominees because home-state senators have yet to make recommendations to the White House to begin with  and in states with two GOP senators, that means they can delay the process there. (However, we hear that President Obama has sufficiently badgered at least Democratic senators to start providing names of judges, and observers are expecting a raft of new names from the White House soon.)</blockquote>First, it's good reporting to note the Senate's role in the delays in judicial nominations at the very beginning of the process.<br /><br />But what's this about Democratic Senators? We know (or at least we think we know) that Republican Senators have been slow-walking nominations in their states, but the general sense I've had is that the delays in Democratic states have been the administration's fault. Here, it's posed as the fault of Democratic Senators -- at least recently. Is that true?<br /><br />One way to look at it is that it's fair to blame Obama up to the point that he makes it clear that he's doing whatever he can; that is, if he hasn't been "sufficiently badgering" in public, we know he hasn't done everything he can do. But overall, it's hard to tell! So, good reporting here, but more, please.<br /><br />Oh - and that "raft" of new names? Seems like we've been hearing that all year, which makes me more inclined to think that the whole paragraph is mainly WH spin. Of course, we eventually did get the three DC Circuit picks, so you never know.

Breaking: Boehner Is Constrained By His Conference.<----->There's a lot of nonsense on the "Hastert Rule" going around, and a lot of nonsense on John Boehner as a "weak" Speaker.<br /><br />I've talked about many times, but here's the short version:<br /><br />There's just no way that a Speaker is going to habitually do things that his conference doesn't want. Any Speaker who did that wouldn't last very long at all. A Speaker isn't "weak" because he's constrained that way; Nancy Pelosi was equally constrained by her caucus, and so were Jim Wright and Newt Gingrich, and so are all of them.<br /><br />That doesn't need to be incorporated into any formal rule; it's just how it is.<br /><br />What's more, just as partisan context needs to be included to assess how a president is doing with Congress, so does the partisan context need to be included if we are interested in assessing a Speaker's performance. The larger, and the more unified, the majority party, the easier it is for the Speaker to appear "strong." But that's not the Speaker's strength; it's just a function of a large, unified majority. Tip O'Neill didn't suddenly get better at being Speaker in 1983; he just had a liberal majority that wasn't available in 1981-1982.<br /><br />There are variations beyond simple majority size and unity. Newt Gingrich and Jim Wright both alienated Members who didn't like their bullying style (and, in the case of Gingrich, his poor negotiating record with the Clinton White House). O'Neill, Pelosi, and (I believe) Boehner have been particularly good at listening to their Members, and moving the agenda towards consensus positions when they can. But no Speaker simply dictates to co-equal Members of the House what to do, and John Boehner isn't unusually weak because he can't or won't do so.
Nuclear Logic (Why Lautenberg Probably Doesn't Matter)<----->Greg has some reporting out today on the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/06/17/do-senate-dems-have-the-votes-for-the-nuclear-option/">concerns among Senate Democrats</a> that Frank Lautenberg's death &nbsp;may tip things against majority-imposed reform; with several Democratic defections possible and at least a couple likely, losing that one sure vote for reform could be the difference.<br /><br />I don't question his reporting -- that is, I'm sure that Democrats are saying what he reports they're saying -- but I don't really believe it. I continue to believe it's highly unlikely that the Democrats will act unless they're very close to being unanimous. One defection, maybe; two, perhaps; more, and I don't think anything happens.<br /><br />That's in part because of the spin on it; I think a lot of Democrats are likely worried that a narrow vote with every Republican and a four (or, previously, five) Democrats opposing reform would mean that they'll lose the spin battle. I think that's probably a foolish reason; it won't really matter who wins the fight over whether majority-imposed reform is "good government" or "majority tyranny." No one cares about Senate procedure; &nbsp;most of the press will forget about it in a couple of weeks, and voters will never have noticed.<br /><br />(Caveat: it's certainly possible that the conservative information loop will find majority-imposed reform to be a product that sells, but that just means it's substituting for some other product; it won't affect votes in 2014 or 2106).<br /><br />However, it's also in part because I don't really think that the most reluctant Democrats are acting independently. I think quite a few Democrats are reluctant to change the rules. The balance here is between the incentives for them as individual Senators to retain their individual influence within the Senate and the incentives for them as Democrats to advance the party agenda. What determines the balance isn't so much individual variation among Democrats, but the level of GOP obstruction. My strong suspicion here is that there will either be 52 or more votes (out of the 54), or there will be well under 50.<br /><br />The tricky part is that no one wants to specify exactly how many and which positions Republicans would have to obstruct in order to trigger that 52+ number, since doing so would give them license to block everything up to that line. What's more, I'm not convinced that any of the Democrats, including Harry Reid, have a precise formula in mind. Instead, I think they'll work it out together, based on what Republicans do, what Democratic party actors do, and perhaps to a small extent what Barack Obama does. But I do think that it's going to be more of a collective decision than a set of separate individual decisions.<br /><br />Oh, and I think some sort of bipartisan efforts to avert majority-imposed reform is fairly likely.<br /><br />No prediction from me on the outcome of any of this. And I'm an outsider here; the reporting could well be more correct than my outsider analysis. But that's how I see the incentives involved.
Finding a House Majority on Immigration<----->The news on immigration today is <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/john-boehner-wont-back-immigration-bill-without-majority-gop-support/article/2531983">John Boehner rejecting the option of passing a bill with mostly Democratic votes.</a> Or so he says; Jonathan Chait <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/06/gaffe-that-threatens-immigration-reform.html">points out</a> that Boehner's position makes him prone to bluffing. But for now:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"I just don't think that's the winning formula here," Cole told The Washington Examiner. "What the speaker wants to do is have a hopefully bipartisan product -- certainly one that has the majority of Republicans -- pass the House. This has got too much emotional, political impact and I think it really has to be genuinely bipartisan."</blockquote>I'm sure that the Speaker wants a "bipartisan product."<br /><br />I just don't see how it happens.<br /><br />As Greg Sargent <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/06/17/the-morning-plum-marco-rubios-epic-challenge-on-immigration/">explains</a> today, there's really "no papering over" the key question: is there a (real) path to citizenship, or not?<br /><br />If there is, then it's virtually certain that the majority of House Republicans will oppose. If not, it's virtually certain that an overwhelming majority of House Democrats will oppose.<br /><br />That, it seems to me, is obvious and easy. The more complicated question is whether there's any House majority at all behind anything.<br /><br />Is there a GOP-only majority? I really doubt it. There are 234 Republicans right now, so if they lose more than 16 they will need help from the Democrats. It's possible that the whole GOP conference can be rallied to support something, but it's clearly hard work. I'm pretty convinced that there are at least 20 Republicans who would only support immigration-bashing measures, and also at least 20 Republicans who are pro-immigration. As far as I can tell, the only way something gets 218 Republicans is if they wind up putting the value of proving they can pass something ahead of their policy positions, and I'm not sure why they would want to do that.<br /><br />What about a mostly-Republican bill? I'd love to see some reporting on where the remaining "Blue Dog" Democrats are on this. It seems (at least based on what we're seeing in the Senate) that most or all of them would support a comprehensive bill, but they could support, say, a border-security-only bill and still say they were for comprehensive reform. On the other hand, they would be getting on the wrong side of Latino groups -- and, remember, the wrong side of business. My guess, and it's completely just a guess, is that it's going to be very, very difficult to find a mostly-Republicans majority.<br /><br />In other words, the reason I've been saying that Boehner would eventually have to decide whether to move bill with mostly Democratic votes is because I don't really think he has another option. Not just for something that could become law, but for anything to get through the House at all.<br /><br />That could be wrong! A GOP-only bill is possible if Republicans agree to ignore their policy preferences for a while in order to get the "narrative" victory of passing something. A GOP-mostly bill is possible if a fair number of Democrats who would vote for a comprehensive bill would also vote for a GOP-written bill without citizenship. I don't think those votes are there, but I could easily be wrong about it. Note, however, that even if they are, that just gets something to conference...actually getting something enacted into law just gets them back to the original question, because it's pretty certain that nothing becomes law without citizenship. And, once again, most Republicans are not going to vote for citizenship.<br /><br />All of which gets back to my initial sense that the question is all about whether House Republicans want a comprehensive bill to become law, or not. If not, Boehner won't bring it up, and it's dead. If so, Boehner will bring it up, and it probably has the votes (with, that is, a fairly large group quietly wanting that solution even as they vote against it and very likely denounce Boehner publicly for doing what they want him to do).

June 16, 1973<----->The Ervin Committee hearings have been continuing. The most important witness so far has been Jeb Magruder, but at this point everyone is waiting for John Dean. On the 16th, Dean does his pre-testimony in a closed session. That was the standard committee procedure, but Dean had resisted -- he and his lawyers wanted to stage manage his own testimony, and the executive session ran the risk that his bombshells would be leaked according to someone else's agenda.<br /><br />Dean was supposed to begin his public, televised testimony during the week of June 18th, but Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet leader, was in the US, and the Watergate Committee agreed to delay until after the Brezhnev-Nixon summit was completed.<br /><br />Behind the scenes, perhaps the most important thing in this period is that the White House and Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox are already beginning to build to a confrontation.<br /><br />Emery makes much of Dean's closed door testimony -- Dean brandished Howard Baker's secret meeting with Nixon, presumably to pressure Baker to play nice in the public sessions (or else Dean would imply that Baker was in the pocket of the White House).<br /><br />And no one wants that. In early June, Nixon's Gallup approval stayed at the same 44% he had been at in mid-May. It's not disaster-level, but his time as a popular president is very much over.
Sunday Question for Liberals<----->Eric Holder: weak link in the Obama cabinet who should be replaced, or target of a bum rap?
Sunday Question for Conservatives<----->Chris Christie: half (at least) RINO who at best is the best to hope for in New Jersey, but certainly should be nowhere near a national ticket? Or: a promising conservative presidential candidate?
For Tuesday I Walk to the Village<----->And it's Election Day again in my neighborhood. I'm in one of only two districts where the city council contest wound up as a run-off, and so it gets resolved today.<br /><br />That's just one mark on the ballot. It's the second election day of the year, and second of the two and four year cycles; I've only had three choices, total, to make so far. And all of them were relatively easy in that the offices at least make sense (mayor and city council), although made unnecessarily difficult because they were nonpartisan elections. That's hardly anything! I'm not certain, but I think we may have one more election day later this year if there are any Texas constitutional amendments that have to be approved; other than that, it's possible we'll go all the way until next year's primary elections.
What Mattered This Week?<----->I'm pretty much with the people who suspect that US involvement in Syria will matter less than it may seem, but at the same time that the overall Syria conflict does matter.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>As far as something that doesn't matter? Skirmishes about the "Hastert rule" and immigration over on the House side. It's all for show. John Boehner isn't going to try to bully this thing through unless most of his Members want him to. Whatever they say for the cameras.</div>
The Anti-Quagmire President (So Far)<----->On Obama and Syria: the one area of national security and foreign policy in which Barack Obama really has earned the benefit of the doubt is about slippery slopes, quagmires, and otherwise getting trapped into military adventurism that expands despite everyone's best intentions.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>His record on this is really quite impressive. He got out of Iraq (yes, he was only following George W. Bush's policy and a signed agreement with the Iraqis, but it wouldn't have been the first time a president managed to keep troops where they weren't really wanted). His intervention in Libya was limited and stayed limited. In Mali, Yemen, and other conflicts, he committed to a minimal level of action and stuck with it. And in Afghanistan, he "surged" -- but then de-escalated and appears to be on a path to continue getting out. At no point that I remember did the Obama Administration give in to the kinds of "in for a dime, in for a dollar" arguments that wind up leading to real messes. The administration has consistently been willing to absorb predictable attacks for bugging out too early or for doing too little.</div><div><br /></div><div>Perhaps Syria will turn out different -- and those who oppose intervention there (or I suppose those who support the current level of intervention but oppose any further action) should obviously be advocating for what they want rather than just trusting Obama. But overall...he hasn't earned anyone's trust on civil liberties or open government, and he's made his share of foreign policy/national security blunders, but he might be the best since Ike at knowing how to keep engagements limited.</div>
Catch of the Day<----->Kevin Drum <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/06/quote-day-we-should-treat-citizenry-mushrooms">listened</a> to the disgraced former Speaker saying about anti-terrorism methods that "people will tolerate it as long as it's genuinely secret." Drum:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Yeah, I guess people will tolerate just about anything as long as they don't know it's happening. This is why Newt is the philosopher king of the Republican Party.</blockquote>The thing is: <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2010/04/newt-update.html">Tom P. Baxter</a> (as I like to call him) has always been exactly that same kind of fraud, and it was pretty clear from his presidential campaign that just about every party actor from the precinct level on up knew it, but yet they're still perfectly happy to parade him for the rubes he specializes in fleecing. I mean, we're right to laugh about it, but we also know that Republicans do seem perfectly willing to pretend that Newt is a Wise Man of Conservatives, when they actually know that he's not only not wise, but not particularly committed to being conservative, either.<br /><br />At any rate: Nice catch!
Read Stuff, You Should<----->Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/Rancid-MN0000335747">Matt Freeman</a>, 47. <br /><br />Plus a little good stuff:<br /><br /><br />1. Josh Putnam's latest <a href="http://frontloading.blogspot.com/2013/06/update-2016-presidential-primary.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+fhq+%28Frontloading+HQ%29">update on the 2016 calendar.</a><br /><br />2. <a href="http://founders.archives.gov/">The Founders online</a>?

ENDA May Have a Chance<----->Here's how fast things are changing on issues affecting sexual orientation and gender identity: there's actually a realistic chance that the Employment Non-Discrimination Act could pass the divided Congress. And it seems very likely that at the very least, Democrats will push it &nbsp;aggressively.<br /><br />That was the word from Harry Reid earlier this week, when he promised that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/10/harry-reid-enda_n_3417653.html">the Senate would take up the legislation "soon,"</a> although he didn't specify when. And now Barack Obama <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/06/13/is-this-the-year-to-end-anti-gay-workplace-discrimination/">may be planning to push it himself</a>. It's no surprise; the current bill has 48 co-sponsors; that's three more than the version which died in the 111th Congress (2009-2010), even though that Senate had more Democrats. Over in the House, &nbsp;the companion legislation has 175 cosponsors.<br /><br />One would expect that the bill would have no chance in the Republican House, but I'm not so sure; it's not impossible that this could wind up being like the Violence Against Women Act, something so difficult to explain opposing that the House would rather just let it pass than stand in the way. ENDA <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2011/06/02/9716/polls-show-huge-public-support-for-gay-and-transgender-workplace-protections/">polls extremely well</a>, with many Americans surprised that employers can fire people based on non-work factors absent of specific laws prohibiting it. I'm never sure how seriously to take that kind of polling, but I can really imagine a lot of Republican Senators being reluctant to filibuster the bill -- and it's even possible to imagine House Republicans wanting to make the bill go away by having John Boehner bring it to the floor for passage (even while they vote against it in order to protect against primary challengers).<br /><br />No predictions. Just taking note of what really is an amazing change -- that ENDA could have reached the status of motherhood and apple pie (and VAWA) to the extent that politicians may actually fear stopping it.
How Soon Tax Reform?<----->Earlier this week, Stan Collender wrote a longish piece about <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/stan-collender/2743/no-tax-reform-end-decade">the prospects for tax reform</a>. His bottom line? Don't expect anything until 2017.<br /><br />He makes several points, most of which I agree with. But I'm not sure I agree with the conclusion. In particular, Collender argues, essentially, that tax reform will happen only when Republicans give in to the Democratic position that reform should be revenue-positive this time around, as opposed to the revenue-neutral 1986 effort.<br /><br />I strongly disagree with that -- as I've argued in the past, I think tax reform is really only plausible when it's revenue-neutral. Why? Because tax reform by its nature is all about overcoming well-organized, generally influential losers by putting together a coalition of marginal winners. That only works if the end product is essentially an overall net winner (because it increases economic efficiency). Use it to raise revenues, and you lose most or all of that. That's one way to look at it; another is that it's not plausible that a revenue-raising bill of any kind will attract very many Republican votes in the foreseeable future, which means that the votes just aren't going to be there.<br /><br />Because of that, I'd say that the recent reductions in the deficit -- and more importantly, the recent reductions in everyone's focus on the deficit, along with the at least partial demise of "grand bargain" talk -- is extremely good news for tax reform. It still doesn't make it easy, or likely, but I think the only chance for tax reform is to decouple it from deficits and grand bargains. Indeed, that's what happened in the 1980s; tax reform was (as far as I remember) placed on a completely different track from Gramm-Rudman and other deficit-cutting efforts.<br /><br />The other thing I'd say about tax reform is that it's no surprise that it's rising to the top of the agenda during a second term of a presidency and during divided government. Regardless of what House Republicans are saying right now, tax reform is never at the top of any party's agenda -- for example, Ed Kilgore makes the sensible point that <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2013_06/forget_about_bipartisan_tax_re045235.php">the IRS scandal could revive GOP flat tax mania</a>, making "normal" tax reform that much less possible. A new presidency brings a new agenda, and tax reform is unlikely to be near the top. Especially if there's another round of unified government.<br /><br />So while I agree with Collender about all the reasons that tax reform is difficult at best over the next three years, I think this is still the real window; if it doesn't happen now, it's likely not to happen for a while.

One Small Point for a Plain Blog Theory<-----><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/town-meeting-obamacare-92604.html">A "townhall" meeting in Maryland about the Affordable Care Act</a>&nbsp;(my emphasis):<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">But politics  so entwined with the health law in Washington  barely came up in the 90-minute discussion. <i>The term Obamacare was not uttered</i>. Neither was Democrat nor Republican. The only mention of the president was during a brief history of the laws passage.<br /><br />The only political comment came from a senior citizen who said that he likes some pieces of the law  the age 26 provision and pre-existing condition coverage  but demanded to know if people realize that it also raises taxes.</blockquote>Hey, it's one meeting, one report of one meeting, who knows. But <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-future-of-obamacare-again.html">here's what I said</a> (last summer, but I've been saying it from the start):<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">If ACA survives and is implemented and basically works, then it will eventually lose its name...any name. The exchanges will be called whatever they're called, and the various other pieces of it may have names (so we'll have the IPAB), but most people and even most politicians won't associate that stuff with the ACA or Obamacare. No one will think to call Medicaid expansion anything; it'll just be how Medicaid is. No one will have a name for the subsidies, any more than we have a legislative name for the mortgage interest tax subsidy. We'll have serious mistakes, too: people won't remember what was ACA and what was previous policy and what was in subsequent legislation.</blockquote>Is this the first step on the road to ACA becoming invisible? We'll see, and I'll be tracking it.
Catch of the Day<----->The Catch goes to John Sides for <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/2013/06/12/on-americans-wishy-washy-civil-libertarianism/">pointing out some interesting research from last year</a>. As John sums it up,&nbsp;Jeffery Mondak and Jon Hurwitz found:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">For civil libertarians dismayed at many (most?) Americans willingness to accept an expanded national security state, the problem may lie not so much with the threat of terrorism, but with a general failure to defend civil liberties.</blockquote>That's worth knowing; terrorism isn't a special case, but part of a more general lack of commitment to civil liberties.<br /><br />That's generally a pretty big problem for the small group (and I'm in that group) who really do consider civil liberties a priority. Basically, you can get lip service support, but it's not deep at all, and for many it doesn't take much to get to where the trade-offs are worth it.<br /><br />What's more, the incentives for politicians are asymmetrical in a way that biases against civil liberties. That is: the downside of an incremental loss of civil liberties isn't ever going to be very large. But the downside, or at least the perceived downside, of insisting on civil liberties at the expense of some competing value is almost always going to be lopsided in favor of the other value.<br /><br />And unfortunately, I don't think it's a problem that can be solved. About the best we can hope for is either luck of the draw with politicians who just happen to care about these issues, or, more likely, the courts stepping in.<br /><br />At any rate: nice catch!
Congress Gags Itself<----->I like this Kevin Drum item <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/06/watching-watchmen-nsa-edition">on NSA and oversight</a>, but it repeats something which I think shouldn't be accepted so easily by everyone:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The traditional method of oversight is via congressional committees and the court system. But even if you assume that intelligence organizations are reporting their activities honestly, those don't really work anymore. Once a program is in place, courts end up rubber stamping virtually every application and congressional committees do pretty much the same. They simply become too accustomed to what's going on to truly pay attention. And in the case of Congress, even if some members do have issues, they're all but gagged from speaking out about them.</blockquote>Congress is gagged, yes -- but because they allow themselves to be gagged. It's not inherently up to the bureaucracy or the president to set the rules about secrecy. Congress can do that. And they do, either explicitly or implicitly.<br /><br />Granted: both the president and the bureaucracy can fight for the rules they prefer, too. But Congress, when they really want to do something, have plenty of tools to make it happen.<br /><br />The reality here is that Members of Congress, with only a few exceptions, have been perfectly happy to gag themselves. To some extent that's because they approved of policies they didn't want publicity about, perhaps because they believe publicity would harm the consensus for those policies. To some extent it probably is because they are concerned about actual national security damage if secrets were publicized; that can be sincere even if it's wrong. But to a large extent, it's probably because pretending that they have no ability to do anything -- they can't even talk about it! -- is a very nice way of ducking responsibility.<br /><br />I wrote something over the weekend saying that those upset about the NSA stories should be <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/06/08/blame_congress_for_the_nsas_overreach/">putting a lot of the blame on Congress</a>, and this is yet another part of it. This is Congress's job. no one should let them off the hook with the excuse that they "have to" do what the NSA or the president says.

And 1990. And 1992. And every election through at least 2000, which means at least through the point at which National Journal acquired it in 1996. I've had Hotline access on and off over the years, depending on where I worked, and it's been consistently excellent throughout. Not only extremely informative, but always a lot of fun. In fact, just last week I realized <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/newsletters">you could get "Wake-Up Call"</a> via email, and subscribed.<br /><br />Before the Hotline...well, you just couldn't get a lot of information. Polling aggregation, news stories about Senate and House races as well as presidential nominations, the important and the trivial; I don't know whether Bailey invented aggregation on that level, but it was definitely a big step forward for political information, and it was done right. <br /><br />By all accounts, Bailey was also a good guy, and a solid campaign consultant before he left that business. I do know that there are Hotline alums all over the place, and the ones I know of are generally excellent. I assume he deserves a good deal of the credit for that, too, either directly or by establishing the right kind of workplace. <br /><br />The Hotline was a terrific achievement, one that made politics better for a long time. He'll be missed.
The Changing National Self-Image<----->Not sure if I'm going to get to any regular news posting today and tomorrow, but I've been touristing around Washington all weekend and can at least share a few thoughts on that.<br /><br />Mainly, on the changes to the Mall. I hadn't previously been able to see the WWII and Korea Memorials; I also hadn't seen the King Memorial, although I had seen FDR already.<br /><br />I had a fairly mixed view of the WWII memorial...I really don't have much of a problem with heroic, triumphant national self-celebration. Was it specific enough to the conflict? I'm not sure, and I'm not sure that the size was sustained by the content -- it's very large, that is, and yet it's not entirely clear why.<br /><br />I do find the placement of it, along with the Korea and Vietnam memorials, striking in how it almost completely upends the old feel of the Mall.<br /><br />When I first visited Washington, none of those were there. The Mall was defined by Washington and Lincoln and, although he's off to the side and only visible from a small area, by Jefferson; what's more, it's defined by Congress, on the other end from Lincoln, and then the White House, also only visible from a small area.<br /><br />While the Smithsonian museums (fewer then) do take up a large amount of space, the addition of the war memorials does two things. On the one hand, it makes the national self-image seem far more obsessed with all things military. I really don't like that at all. But there's a second part to it: all three of those war memorials are focused mainly (and with Vietnam exclusively) on the ordinary people involved, not on generals and presidents. That's a real contrast with the old Mall of Abe, George, Tom, the White House, and Congress. Add to that a heroic memorial to an advocate for social justice and a very populist memorial to FDR.<br /><br />So: the theory is that since the 1970s the US self-image as seen in the National Mall is both more militaristic and more democratic.
Sunday Question for Everyone<----->Sorry, on the run, so I'm going to do just one question today and I suspect it's one that I've asked before. But it's newly relevant now, and so: during the 2016 election, are civil liberties/surveillance issues important in the nomination battles? In one party, the other, or both? Are they important in the general election?<br /><br />By "important" I'm just talking about what the candidates talk about and what the press talks about. No matter what, these types of issues are extremely unlikely to move votes, but there's more to elections than what moves votes.
What Mattered This Week?<----->I'm not sure how the NSA revelations mattered, but odds are they did. Alec McGillis has <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/113413/nsa-spying-scandal-could-cleanse-america-post-911-mindset#">one argument</a> on it all; sounds plausible to me.<br /><br />For what doesn't matter...there's a bit of a spin war about how ACA will work out. The substance of that matters a lot; the spin, almost none.<br /><br />So that's what I have. What am I missing? What do you think mattered this week?
Read Stuff, You Should (Plus Housekeeping)<----->Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0652119/">Ken Osmond,</a> 70. <br /><br />And some good stuff:<br /><br /><br />1.

Very interesting.<br /><br />And I'm on the road through Tuesday...I'll almost certainly put up the normal weekend posts, but don't expect much more than that over the next few days.
Old, Old, Senate Update<----->Two special elections to replace two older Senators, with the late Senator Lautenberg an especially significant case (he was 89).<br /><br />I think I've written about Massachusetts before, but it's looking very much like a wasted opportunity. Ed Markey, the solid favorite, will turn 67 in July. That's not young!<br /><br />The Republican in the race, Gabriel Gomez, is only 47 (he'll be 48 in August). So there's some hope of a relatively young new Senator. But I'll be pretty surprised if he wins.<br /><br />In New Jersey, the only Republican in the race so far is Steve Lonegan, 57. It's looking as of right this minute that he's reasonably likely to win the nomination, but not be a very strong general election candidate at all in the October special, so the real question appears to be on the Democratic side. Three candidates there: Cory Booker, 44; Frank Pallone, 61; and Rush Holt, 64. C'mon, New Jersey!<br /><br />By the way, it doesn't matter much in the long run, but for whatever it's worth the new placeholder Senator from New Jersey, is...48. Or maybe 47. He was born in 1965, says his newly-updated wikipedia page, and we have him as a 1987 Notre Dame grad, but so far no date of birth.
PEPFAR and the Presidency<----->I have a <a href="http://prospect.org/article/once-upon-time-there-was-president">new column</a> up over at TAP about the presidency, about how the presidency we have isn't particularly Constitution-based. It goes along with last week's column there, which was about why the myth of the magical heroic-king presidency is so persistent; this one is about how our ideas about the presidency gain strength because the Constitutional version is such an empty shell.<br /><br />I used an example at the end about how George W. Bush's program to fight HIV/AIDS in Africa, PEPFAR, was in part a reaction to the "need" for him to have something feel-good to say in his 2003 SOTU speech. As it happens, I also use that initiative as an example of something else about the presidency, so I'll use this excuse to tell that one, too.<br /><br />What I find in explaining the Neustadtian presidency is that the hard part for people to grasp is the part about how the bargaining presidency needs to do "persuade" people and groups to do things across the board. Everyone understands that Congress doesn't have to do what presidents want (even if they often forget it; see, again, that magical hero-king), but the rest of it seems less intuitive to many people. Sometimes that's because there's a basic assumption that, say, the executive branch has to do what presidents say...that's one of the reasons I find Watergate so interesting, since it's chock full of examples of executive branch agencies and departments ignoring what Nixon wanted.<br /><br />Then there's the president's political party, and party-aligned interest groups. Here, I think the assumption is again too often that they will do whatever the president says; presidents are the "leaders" of the party. But that's wrong; parties, and party-aligned groups, are autonomous, and there's little inherent hierarchical structure. It's often in the interest of the party to go along with the president, but any president who thinks he can just issue edicts and have the party fall in line will be very disappointed -- as George W. Bush was when he tried to put a buddy on the Supreme Court.<br /><br />Anyway, to PEPFAR: I really like this example, but I do have one problem, which is that I'm not entirely sure it's true. I always include that disclaimer when I use it....at one point, I wasted a few hours trying to track it down in sort of a half-assed way, and failed, and concluded that I might as well just keep using it as long as I always remember to mention that I'm not sure whether it's correct or not.<br /><br />The point of the story is that presidents are always asking people for things that those people are free to refuse. In this case, the president was George W. Bush, the people were Christian conservatives, and what Bush was asking for was for them to look the other way. Why? Bush, for various sensible presidential reasons (oh, and perhaps also because it was a Good Thing, I suppose) wanted to do something about the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa. The problem? Doing something about the epidemic was going to mean US money paying for condoms, and a lot of Christian conservatives really don't like condoms. If they opposed the initiative, then the Republican Congress probably wasn't going to pass it, at least not in a form in which it could actually work.<br /><br />Bush didn't need Christian conservative groups to support the program. He just needed them to look the other way. Which they didn't have to do!<br /><br />Again, whether that's fictional or not, it's not unusual. Think, for example, about same-sex couples (and the groups who lobby on their behalf) and <a href="http://prospect.org/article/immigration-gay-community-should-take-one-team">the current immigration bill</a>.<br /><br />The point is that Bush couldn't order Christian conservatives to look the other way. He had to "persuade" them. Usually, that's going to take the form of bargaining of some sort, either in particular deals, or more generally keeping a group "on board" enough that it will go along.<br /><br />Presidents, as Neustadt says, have more things to bargain with than anyone else in the political system; they also, however, have more things to ask for, and more people to ask, than anyone else.<br /><br />At any rate, the Prospect column isn't very newsy, but it does get at one of the core issues with the presidency, I hope. It's just a very difficult office to nail down, and it has been from the start.
Read Stuff, You Should<----->Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005301/">Amanda Pays</a>, 54. <br /><br />Just a little good stuff:<br /><br />1.

Immigration? Maybe<----->I have a post up over at Greg's place <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/06/05/do-republicans-want-immigration-reform/">about Marco Rubio's (perhaps) flip</a> on immigration, and at PP about the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/06/05/of-course-there-wont-be-a-bipartisan-house-immigration-bill/">breakdown of the House bipartisan talks</a>. I'm sticking with what I've always said: the big question here is whether mainstream House conservatives want a bill or not. If they do, John Boehner will bring up the Senate bill and let it pass; if not, he won't. End of story.<br /><br />Matt Yglesias has <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/06/05/rubio_and_immigration_reform.html">the same logic</a>, but thinks that surely House Republicans will want it to fail, as have a few people I've seen on twitter. I've written a bunch of things that all concluded that it was all up to House mainstream conservatives, but haven't engaged at all on what their incentives are. So I'll give it a shot here.<br /><br />Here's Yglesias:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">From the GOP perspective, the calculus of a path to citizenship has two elements. On the one hand, most of these new citizens would probably be Democrats. On the other hand, taking part in a bipartisan immigration reform effort might open Latino voters' ears to other aspects of the GOP message. But the absolute worst-case scenario is one in which <i>a path to citzenship becomes law over the loud objections of GOP-elected officials.&nbsp;</i></blockquote>So he concludes it's "unlikely" that the House would do it.<br /><br />He might be right! But there's another point of view which also might win out. Republicans might decide that there's a collective action problem here in which the party as a whole (and especially their future presidential candidates) are better off if immigration passes, but most Members of the House (and many Senators) are better off if they vote against it.<br /><br />And what Yglesias considers the worst-case might not be. Remember, the bill that's going to move, if one does, is the bipartisan Senate bill -- a bill which guarantees that at least three Republicans (the Gang of Eight minus Rubio) will get a fair amount of the credit and will earn a trip to a White House signing ceremony. So opposition to the bill might not be seen as a partisan split even if the majority of Republicans vote against it, and at any rate it might be better for GOP-Latino relations to have the issue disappear after a bill passes than for the issue to stick around to 2016 and beyond.<br /><br />What it might come down to, really, is that bit about "loud objections of GOP-elected officials." If Congressional opponents of the bill can manage to avoid arguments perceived as bigoted -- if they can restrict themselves to praise for immigrants and immigration reform but just not quite <i>this</i> bill -- then the whole thing could at least plausibly work for both individual Members and the GOP as a whole. But if the debate is bound to descend into immigrant-bashing, then it doesn't.<br /><br />The only other thing I could add here is that all of this is about perceptions, not reality. The question isn't what will actually be good for the GOP as a whole; it's what individual Members of the House believe will be good.<br /><br />I have no idea what House conservatives are actually thinking. I just can't see either side being clear and obvious. And my guess is we won't start to know the answers until after the Senate acts.
Read Stuff, You Should<----->Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/o/ortizru01.shtml">Russ Ortiz</a>, 39. Not a bad pitcher in his prime, although his Wins/quality seems fairly high. And then two years after the Giants gave him a way for two guys who never worked out, he went from Atlanta to Arizona...and fell off a cliff. And yet he managed to hang around for at least parts of five more seasons, and more than 50 more starts, despite never again doing better than an 82 ERA+.&nbsp; Anyway, he was fun to root for.<br /><br />Oh, the good stuff:<br /><br />1. Ross Douthat <a href="http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/libertarian-populism-and-its-limits/">takes on conservative libertarians</a>. Interesting.<br /><br />2. While Conor Friedersdorf really doesn't like <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/06/the-hypocrisy-of-a-conservative-elites-new-york-and-dc-bashing/276517/">elite-bashing by elite conservatives</a>.<br /><br />3.

And I'm not a big fan of "<a href="http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/what-is-derp-answer-is-technical.html">derp,</a>" but Noah Smith almost convinces me.
June 4, 1973<----->The Senate Watergate hearings resumed after a long recess. There are plenty of important witnesses, but it's clear both inside the White House and outside that John Dean, scheduled soon, will be the star witness -- and will implicate the president in the cover-up.<br /><br />So today Richard Nixon starts a more serious preparation: for the next week, he listens to hours and hours of the White House tapes. More people are learning of the tapes; in the new White House, it's not restricted to just the chief of staff, but in addition to Al Haig, Ron Zeigler now learns of the tapes, as does WH counsel Len Garment and Fred Buzhardt, who is basically Nixon's on-staff defense attorney.<br /><br />For the Watergate Committee, the big issue today is a <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F7071EF738551A7493C7A9178DD85F478785F9">request from Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox</a> that the committee put everything on hold for up to three months so that Cox can move on the prosecutions, and Sam Ervin's decision to refuse that request. It's an interesting question. Which is more important: the prosecution of any criminal activity, or exposing the truth as soon as possible? Of course, there's an institutional struggle, too; rarely is Neustadt's observation that the Constitution established a system of separated institutions sharing powers more obviously true.<br /><br />At any rate: Ervin would win this round, and the next set of hearings would continue.
Even More on Ted Cruz, Elbows, Senators, and Parties<-----><div class="tr_bq">The story so far:</div><br />John Sides said that Ted Cruz was hurting his chances at the nomination by alienating Republican Senators. Dave Hopkins said: maybe not. I then did a <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/06/01/ted_cruzs_personality_problem/">Salon column</a> over the weekend more or less taking Dave's side. <br /><br />John <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/2013/06/02/further-thoughts-on-ted-cruzs-sharp-elbows/">responded</a>:<br /><blockquote>But any nominee needs broader support in the partysupport beyond his natural base. &nbsp;In fact, Cohen and colleagues show that it is support from party leaders <i>outside</i> a candidates base that is truly potent: it appears to drive fundraising, media coverage, and ultimately poll numbers.[...] &nbsp;My point is that the kinds of behavior that would earn him the endorsements from Senators who are not his conservative kindred are likely to earn him the support of other party leaders who arent in the Senate and are outside his natural base. &nbsp;(And, by the way, thats a base he cant even count on if Paul runs.) &nbsp;And the support of these other leaders is what would be most valuable. &nbsp;Thats why I think Cruzs M.O. isnt optimal. &nbsp;Hes antagonizing some of the same people that would be most useful to have in his corner.</blockquote>And Dave took the bait and responded in detail in the comments. He argues that personal relationships are perhaps less important than other factors in winning endorsements. And he also argues, as I did in the Salon piece, that the kinds of "go along to get along" behavior that winds friends within Congress has rarely helped much on the campaign trail.<br /><br />John then responded to Dave (we're still in comments over at the Monkey Cage), saying "Id suggest that Cruz, by engendering resentment among at least some of his colleagues (and others like them outside of the Senate), may have a harder time convincing enough Republicans" to support him.<br /><br />I'd say the parenthetical is doing a lot of work there -- the "others like them outside of the Senate" bit.<br /><br />What I think, I suppose, is that outsiders -- that is, party actors outside of Congress, and especially outside of Washington -- probably heavily discount either positive or negative reputation for "plays well with others" that's based primarily on intra-Senate testimony. They will look for cues about ideology, sure. But the rest...I'm just not sure that outsiders consider Members of Congress a reliable source of information. Or at least: Washingtonians tend to overrate the extent to which intra-Senate reputation for collegiality will wind up mattering.<br /><br />In other words, what matters here is whether party actors outside of Congress think of themselves as "others like them" or not; that is, whether they think of themselves and the Senators upset by Cruz as part of the same set of non-crazy Republicans, or if they instead them of those Senators as "Congress" and themselves as "not-Congress." And I think there's some evidence, over the years, that it's the latter.<br /><br />On the other hand...there's a lot more of the national Democratic and Republican national parties than there was in 1960, or even in 1980. That might matter, and it might tend to make John's point relatively stronger -- depending, that is, on whether the rest of the national party things of Congress as a body apart or not.<br /><br />What's really at question here is about the various different components of our expanded parties, and how they fit together. Clearly Republican Senators are a part of the larger Republican national party network, and each Senator is part of his or her state's party network, but exactly how important they are to the presidential nomination process, either directly or through their effect on reputation, is a lot trickier to figure out.<br /><br />And I agree with John that we're talking tendencies here, not absolutes. Indeed, on balance I agree with him (and I suspect that Dave does to, although of course I can't speak for him) that "Cruzs behavior, if it continues, is doing more to decrease his chance of winning the GOP nomination than to increase it." I just think it's probably a minor factor, and one that may be in part balanced out by the upside of using the aggressive strategy. But, yes, I think that if Cruz could build his reputation as a demagogue without actually annoying his fellow Senators, that would likely be a bit better for his presidential prospects.
Seeking Washington Tourism Expertise<----->A bit off the usual path: we're finally doing a family trip to Washington this weekend, and I'm looking for tourism suggestions. Specifically, any new stuff I don't know about. I haven't done a touristy trip to Washington since Hector was a pup...well, really, not since my wife and I lived there. I have been over to the (mediocre at best, in my view) FDR Memorial, but otherwise I really haven't done anything touristy in a long, long time.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>So, helpful people: what should I know that I don't know? What's new that wasn't there twenty years ago that should be on a can't-miss list, or even an if-you-have-time list? What's changed about visiting the things that were there that I probably don't know about? The (high-school and college aged) kids are excellent tourists with broad interests, so really anything good is worth knowing about. Any help, or any pointers to further help, would be very much appreciated.</div><div><br /></div><div>Thank you!</div>
Assumption GOP Will Blockade DC Circuit Is Probably Wrong<----->With the three DC Circuit Court of Appeals nominees finally getting named and sent to the Senate today, I'm seeing a lot of liberal pessimism about the next step. Kevin Drum <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/06/wee-question-about-republicans-and-dc-circuit-court">says</a> "We already know that Republicans are going to oppose all three of Obama's nominees...because, based on its caseload, the DC Court is too big and should be pared back by three seats." Matt Yglesias is <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/06/04/dc_circuit_fight.html">even more convinced</a>: "Note that precisely because the stakes are high here the odds of Obama succeeding are approximately zero." I know when I write about the possibility of a GOP blockade in these seats, I regularly get comments hitting me for suggesting that such a blockade is only possible, not virtually certain.<br /><br />I guess we'll see soon enough, but I think this is wrong. For one thing, if Republicans really do choose to explicitly blockade the DC Circuit, it would almost certainly push Democrats over the edge into going nuclear. For another, the Republican record just hasn't been one of blockading Appeals Court nominees. Yes, lots of foot-dragging, and yes, 60 votes are required for all of them, and yes, most draw some opposition...and, yes, a few have been defeated. But that's all. The majority of Barack Obama's appellate nominees have eventually been confirmed -- and that's true whether Republicans had 40 or 41 or 47 or 45 seats in the Senate.<br /><br />Here's my guess -- not a prediction, but just a guess based on past patterns. We'll continue to hear the insipid rhetoric about "court packing" and how the DC Circuit doesn't need any judges anyway, but that will be mostly just background music for the rubes. One of the picks will get through fairly easily. One will be killed by filibuster. And the third will be a close call, but probably get through, perhaps with a few Republicans voting yes on cloture but against confirmation. Those opposing picks will mainly focus on claims that the nominees are out of the mainstream ideologically, or will allege lack of proper judicial temperament, or some other such reason -- very few Republicans will claim that they are blockading the DC Circuit Court.<br /><br />It's a guess, not a prediction. But I do think it's more likely all three will be confirmed than that all three will be defeated. Far more likely.<br /><br />And what's more...if the Judiciary Committee, Harry Reid, and Barack Obama are aggressive about the schedule, including a replacement if one of the current nominees is defeated by filibuster, then all three seats will be filled during the current Congress.

Although I probably should just wait until it really happens to believe it, anyway...]
Remember: In Democracies, Policy is Contested<----->I wrote: "The chief job of party leaders in the Senate is to look out for individual senators interests and protect their rights." Which led to a letter-to-the-editor denouncing me, or Senator, or someone; my sentence "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-trouble-with-congress--in-one-sentence/2013/06/02/8f1aaeec-ca1b-11e2-9cd9-3b9a22a4000a_story.html">perfectly captured whats wrong with Congress</a>."<div><blockquote class="tr_bq">The chief job of leaders in the Senate is to do the peoples business. &nbsp;The minute people in an organization begin protecting their interests and rights instead of doing what the organization is supposed to do is the minute the organization becomes dysfunctional. Unfortunately, that describes most of the government today.</blockquote><div>I pick on this mainly because I suspect this sentiment is extremely widespread. It is, however, wrong.</div><div><br /></div><div>To the letter-writer, I would say: go back to Madison, and read <a href="http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa51.htm">Federalist 51</a>. For Madison, the self-interest of politicians was a given. What's needed, he says, is a way to harness that self-interest for democratic purposes.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Which is exactly what's happening here. Party leaders in the Senate look out for individual Senators' interests -- which means that they make it possible for Senators to work for their own states' interests.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>More broadly, the entire US political system (and, I think, every representative democracy) is based in very large part on the career ambitions of politicians, and thus on electoral incentives. What's unusual about the US system is that great efforts are made to restrain the maximum influence of any one politician or even set of politicians (federalism, separated institutions sharing powers); and, at the same time, individually empowered politicians are given very different constituencies, thus giving them incentives to see particular, localized interests as well as or even more than the "national" interest.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Indeed, one of the big changes over the last fifty years or so has been the rise of the national political parties, which has balanced out to some extent the constitutionally-mandated bias towards localism and particularism. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing is certainly a question for reasonable disagreement, but that it's happened is, in my view at least, clear historic fact.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>If one believes that "the people's business" is self-evident, and that the majority will agree, then it's natural to conclude that something must be wrong with democracy when those self-evident policies are not being followed. The problem with exhorting politicians to just "do the people's business" is that what constitutes "the people's business" is <i>contested. </i>&nbsp;And what to do when large groups disagree about what is self-evident, or at least what is best, is the whole point of democratic design -- and a difficult problem indeed to solve.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Which is not to say that the Framer's solution, as adapted and modified over the years, is the only solution, or even necessarily the best one. But one doesn't get far in designing a democracy without understanding that basic problem.</div><div><br /></div>

Sunday Question for Liberals<----->Yup, the same question as the one for conservatives. <a href="http://www.gallup.com/home.aspx?ref=logo">Gallup has Barack Obama at 47% approval</a> today; where do you expect him to be by January 1?
Sunday Question for Conservatives<----->Barack Obama's <a href="http://www.gallup.com/home.aspx?ref=logo">Gallup approval today is at 47%</a>, which is toward the lower end of the range it's been in during May. Where do you expect it to be by January 1?<br /><br />(Yes, yes, averages are better...but Gallup has the advantage of easy comparison with other presidents, even though all of it should be used with caution).
What Mattered This Week?<----->I haven't mentioned it for a while, I don't think, but I do still believe the war in Syria matters, so I'll go with that this time.<br /><br />For something that doesn't matter...not sure. I did write two Ignore Those Polls! posts this week (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/05/27/ignore-those-polls-obamacare-edition/">ACA</a> and <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/05/ignore-those-polls-scandals-and-economy.html">scandals</a>), so I'll go with that, I suppose.<br /><br />That doesn't seem like a very good job, so I hope y'all have better: what do you have? What do you think mattered this week?
Catch of the Day<----->How about one for some solid reporting: Garance Franke-Ruta completely explodes "<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/05/the-fake-story-about-the-irs-commissioner-and-the-white-house/276399/">The Fake Story About the IRS Commissioner and the White House</a>."<br /><br />The story here was that former IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman had supposedly spend Barack Obama's first term camped out in the Oval Office scheming and plotting, but as it turns out...not so much.<br /><br />What's useful about all this? As with the Benghazi talking points "controversy," there's a bit of useful stuff here about how the bureaucracy actually works, and how the "White House" interacts with the departments and agencies -- to begin with, that the White House is physically not just the White House, but the Old (Eisenhower) and New Executive Office Buildings -- the Old one is familiar to those who have been following the Watergate posts, since Nixon had a hideaway there that he used quite a bit (and for which there was a taping system installed). Here's something I don't know: have presidents since Nixon maintained an office over in what's now the Eisenhower building?<br /><br />At any rate...first of all, it's worth noting that just because the IRS Commissioner didn't really have 157 White House meetings, or even "White House" meetings, doesn't actually mean that there was nothing improper going on. You don't need 157 meetings to do something wrong! It's just more evidence, if any was needed, not to believe everything Bill O'Reilly says or to believe that everything in the Daily Caller has been fully reported.<br /><br />And, as usual, the fact that this one has been exposed as much less than meets the eye will almost certainly not end it's life as a GOP talking point.<br /><br />Also: nice catch!<br /><br /><br />

Representation Works (Weirdly Enough)<----->Jordan Ragusa has a very nice post today using the business about PolitiFact ratings to write about research showing that, yes, <a href="http://rule22.wordpress.com/2013/05/30/are-members-of-congress-truthful-a-response-to-the-politifact-study/">Members of Congress keep their policy promises</a>.<br /><br />As I've discussed at length, but not recently, there's more to representation than just policy promises. That's on of the main findings of Richard Fenno's work: promises also include all sorts of things, including style of representation. Among other things, that to me, is the "solution" to the question of whether representatives "should" be delegates or trustees; the answer is that they should do whatever they said they would do when they were campaigning. But that's just one of the many things that can go into representative style and the representative relationship that politicians develop with their constituents.<br /><br />At any rate, one of the things I find most interesting is why any of this happens. Ragusa is good on this:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Finally, if citizens are (a) unaware of who their elected lawmaker is and (b) as a result woefully ignorant of their representatives position on key votes, the question is: what keeps lawmakers honest? &nbsp;The answer is that while private citizens may not know how their representative or senator voted, general election opponents and interest groups sure do. &nbsp;Thus, while the electorate is generally inattentive to lawmakers voting record, the reelection incentiveand the threat of attack ads from ones rivalkeep lawmakers honest.</blockquote><br />Indeed, in the <a href="http://users.polisci.wisc.edu/apw/archives/sulkin_campaign_appeals.pdf">underlying paper</a>, Tracy Sulkin argues that risk-averse politicians will likely attempt to keep their promises as if they would get in trouble from abandoning them. That sounds right to me, as is her argument that politicians are probably likely to make promises in the first place that they have an interest in keeping.<br /><br />What fascinates me about this, however, is that I really don't buy the idea that politicians, no matter how risk-averse, are really keeping promises because of electoral incentives. It just doesn't wash that it's a significant enough constraint. Especially when it comes to promises about representative style. What we know about the ignorance of voters is just very hard to square with the idea that they will punish their representatives' misbehavior.<br /><br />Sulkin's suggestion that politicians may choose to emphasize particular issues (and presumably style) for personal reasons, rather than for electoral reasons, is promising.<br /><br />But overall, I think it's one of the more puzzling problems in representation, and therefore in democracy. I have an old paper in which I try to get to it (it involves political parties, Arendt, and the "touch of Harry in the night" scene, and yes, I suppose I should try to do something with that paper). I do think that representation is real, and really "works," and that the fact it works is central to how democracy actually does what we want it to do...but the whole topic is filled with difficulty.
Ignore Those Polls! (Scandals and the Economy Edition)<----->There's a <a href="http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-and-centers/polling-institute/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=1899">new Quinnipiac poll</a> out with findings about scandalmania that are drawing attention, including a ranking of the scandals (respondents answered that the IRS scandal is more important than Benghazi or the AP stories) and something that sounds very nice at the moment for Democrats: by a large margin, respondents say that the economy is more important than the scandals.<br /><br />Ignore those polls!<br /><br />First: people are notoriously terrible about predicting how events will affect their votes, or even their future opinions. People may say that the economy is more important than scandals...but if scandals are in the news constantly, people will pay attention, and they could well affect vote choice even if in some abstract sense voters don't "think" they are important. What's more, constant news coverage -- if it continues -- will strongly signal that a scandal is important, and people will respond accordingly.<br /><br />Second: the polling that really tells us something about voters and the scandals so far is already out, with the president's approval ratings holding steady over the last month (actually, <a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/obama-job-approval#!mindate=2012-05-01&amp;smoothing=less&amp;estimate=custom">Pollster's average</a> has had Obama's approval ratings on a slow decline since the beginning of the year, but setting it to "less smoothing" shows that decline has decelerated since mid-March, and certainly no apparent new movement since the IRS thing broke). Here, the Q poll has a low Obama approval number of 45%, down three ticks from May 1, but as always the polling averages are more useful, and they've already told as that nothing's happening.<br /><br />Third: So we know that unlike, say, Iran-Contra, the current scandalmania is not having a significant direct effect on the president's popularity. But we also know that absent new revelations, each of these stories will be ancient and forgotten by the time voters engage in the 2014 election cycle. Really, then, what's needed is good guesses about the scandals themselves, and voters aren't in a particularly good position to make those guesses.<br /><br />In other words, if it turns out that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton secretly worked with zombie bin Laden to plan and carry out Benghazi, then nothing voters say now about the IRS story being more important, or the economy trumping any of the scandals, will matter. If on the other hand Benghazi continues to be about parsing the difference between terror attacks and terrorist attacks...well, we've long known that no one apart from dedicated partisans cares about it.<br /><br />All in all, other than tossing another number into the approval averages, I think we're safe ignoring this stuff. Given that scandalmania isn't doing anything significant now, the way that people rank the individual stories or how they compare them to other vote factors just isn't telling us anything.

I'm Here I'm Not<----->Hey, it's MMM -- Marjorie Margolies, one term Clinton-era Member of the House (and now Clinton extended family member) is reported to be <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/05/29/marjorie-margolies-running-for-congress-again/">running for her old House seat in Pennsylvania</a>.&nbsp;I have no idea whether she'll return to Congress; she'll apparently have to survive what could be a tough primary for an open Democratic seat.<br /><br />Margolies (at the time Margolies-Mezvinsky, thus MMM) is famous for supplying the winning vote for the Democratic budget in 1993 and then, as Republicans predicted, losing her seat in the GOP landslide of 1994. At the time, her district was hotly contested, and so it's no surprise that she failed to hold it; 1992 was a good year for Democrats, and 1994 a bad one, however she had chosen to vote on that bill. She had won <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Margolies">very narrowly in 1992</a>, by less than a single percentage point, and then lost by four points in 1994 -- a far smaller swing than her party suffered nationally. One has to be careful about these things...the national swing was probably driven mostly by enormous shifts in Southern districts, so it would be useful to match up comparable districts to see what happened. Still, it's hard to say from those numbers that her loss had much to do with her, or her vote. It's more of a myth than fact.<br /><br />At the same time -- it's hard to argue that Democrats in 1994 would have been worse off if their economic plan had been defeated in the House (if there really was no other available vote). Republicans could still have run against it -- and against Democratic chaos, as well. Of course, they had plenty of that, with Clinton's failed stimulus and failed heath care plan. That is, failed in Congress.<br /><br />The other point about Margolies, which I <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2010/03/forget-your-conscience.html">talked about</a> last time she was in the news, is that her vote is often discussed in terms of voting her convictions against her district, but that's not how she describes it; in an op-ed during the Obama-era health care debate, she defended her vote in terms of how it (in her view) was good for her district, not in terms of putting some other priority ahead of representation. That doesn't necessarily mean she was a good representative -- that's a much more complicated question. But it does seem that she was attempting to do what she thought was good for the district.<br /><br />I'm sure nothing anyone says at this point can change what everyone "knows" about her brief tenure in the House. It's worth noting, however, that much of what everyone "knows" appears not to be actually true.<br /><br /><br />
Dear Liar Love Me (Elsewhere...)<----->At PP today I have an item <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/05/29/how-to-use-fact-checkers-ignore-the-conclusions/">talking</a> about fact checkers -- and echoing the point from John Sides and Brendan Nyhan that one should be extremely cautious about concluding anything from the ratings that those fact checkers give out.<br /><br />Yesterday over there I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/05/28/the-coming-showdown-on-judicial-nominations/">wrote</a> about the coming showdown on judicial nominations.<br /><br />At Greg's place yesterday, I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/05/28/gops-post-policy-posture-harms-gop-aligned-interest-groups/">discussed </a>one of the potentially dangerous consequences of the post-policy GOP: that they may not be able to tend to the policy preferences of their aligned interest groups.<br /><br />And at Plum Line on Monday I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/05/27/the-basic-math-of-immigration-reform-in-the-house/">looked at</a> the math for immigration reform in the House.
My Crazy Afternoon<----->Michele Bachmann, retiring from the House one step of the ethics investigators and, most likely, her district's voters. Garance Franke-Ruta <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/05/reading-between-the-lines-of-michele-bachmanns-retirement-speech/276332/">watches her announcement video</a>; Jonathan Chait <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/05/michele-bachmann-retires-as-crazyland-president.html">remembers some of her greatest hits</a>.<br /><br />Notes?<br /><br />1. No, she was never the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, or anything more than an extreme longshot.<br /><br />2. Yes, she certainly did bring The Crazy. If she didn't really believe the things she said, she did an excellent job of acting as if she did.<br /><br />3. No, it's not true that most Republican Members of the House are interchangably nuts. There's really only a small group, maybe only a handful, who share Bachmann's true dedication to The Crazy.<br /><br />4. However, it's also true that sane conservatives in Congress are not only reluctant to criticize the Crazy Caucus, but are in many cases willing to borrow liberally (or perhaps I should say generously?) from things the Crazy Caucus comes up with or dredges up from Beck or chain emails or wherever.<br /><br />5. More generally: to the extent that one of the big driving motivations for mainstream, sane conservative politicians is to avoid the "RINO" label -- and it appears that this motivation is quite strong -- they, the GOP-aligned press, and rank-and-file conservative voters give enormous power to the fringe Crazy Caucus.<br /><br />6. That is, and to generalize: mainstream liberal Democrats try to differentiate themselves from the most extreme liberals in order to appeal to general election swing voters; mainstream conservative Republicans try to group themselves <i>with</i>&nbsp;the most extreme conservatives in order to appeal to primary election RINO-hunters, and have not found any way to cling to extreme but sane conservatives without also keeping fairly close to the Crazy Caucus.<br /><br />7. Back to Bachmann: assuming she's not going to jail, Beck's network certainly seems like the logical destination for her. I've seen some twitter chatter about the possibility she may seek higher office, but it doesn't much matter; she's almost certainly never going to be elected statewide in Minnesota, and if she does run for president again she'll remain a fringe candidate with no realistic chance of doing anything more than (perhaps) crowding out other fringe candidates.<br /><br />8. All bloggers will, naturally, miss her: our lonely eyes now turn to Louie Gohmert, and to the near-certainty that, as Sarah Posner points out,&nbsp;<a href="http://sarahposner.wordpress.com/2013/05/29/michele-bachmann-one-of-a-kind/">there will be others</a>.

Are Harry Reid's Threats Working?<----->Item: Sri Srinivasan was confirmed for the DC Circuit Court, the first Obama pick to reach that important bench.<br /><br />Item: District Judge nominee <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00125">William Orrick was confirmed 56-41</a> on May 15 (with two Democrats and one Republican missing the vote); no cloture vote was taken. There was also a minor executive branch confirmation a week before that with a <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00114">53-45 vote</a>, also without a cloture vote.<br /><br />Item: Rob Portman is apparently <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/news/portman_seeks_path_to_break_impasse_on_cordray_nomination-225171-1.html">trying to cut a deal on the Cordray nomination</a> for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, one of the "nullification" blockade filibusters. In the Roll Call article, he's supposedly only asking for an Inspector General (something that Democrats would almost certainly be glad to give him), rather than for the restructuring that Republicans have been demanding as the price for letting any nominee through. I agree with David Dayen's <a href="https://twitter.com/ddayen/status/339481564834566146">skepticism</a>&nbsp;that Republicans really would do that deal, but for whatever it's worth, that's the report.<br /><br />Put it all together, and do you have evidence that Republicans are actually moving a bit in response to Harry Reid's threats to go nuclear?<br /><br />To tell the truth...I'm not sure. A Cordray deal the Democrats could live with would be a major GOP loss, but that's pretty much at the rumor stage at best. The two nominations without 60...that's something we've seen in the past, too, and remember that we're talking here about a District Court nominee (where several Republicans have been reluctant to take the filibuster) and another obscure one. The Srinivasan confirmation, and in fact that's one of six appeals court judges confirmed this year against one killed by filibuster, is certainly a positive step, but again it's not as if Republicans have ever blocked absolutely everything, so it's very tricky to know what's a retreat and what's just business as usual.<br /><br />And certainly there's no shortage of current filibusters and threats of filibusters. It's hardly the case that Republicans have full-out retreated.<br /><br />As I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/05/28/the-coming-showdown-on-judicial-nominations/">said</a> earlier today over at PP, we just don't know yet how much of Republican talk about the remaining DC Circuit nominees (assuming that actually happens) is bluff, and how much of it is real. Nor do we know whether nominees for Labor and EPA will get five Republican votes for cloture. My best guess is that one or two of this group -- CFPB, Labor, EPA, DC Circuit -- will be killed by filibuster, and the other four or five will just barely make it...and that this will be just enough to avoid the nukes. But that's a guess!<br /><br />I know that a lot of liberals believe that Republicans simply will not back down at all. That might be true, but there's just no way to know right now.<br /><br />Which is why what Reid's been doing -- keeping the threat of majority-imposed reform alive and increasing it as needed -- is the right strategy.<br /><br />At any rate, I guess we're going to know a lot more in a few weeks.
No Available Fix for Politician Paranoia<----->I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/28/did-i-get-the-money-and-politics-debate-all-wrong/">highly recommend a post by Ezra Klein today about money in politics</a>. He's following up on an earlier item he did about money in the 2012 election cycle being overhyped; today he's taking on criticisms of that one. It's excellent: he doesn't back down on the basic point that the "campaign finance community" (as he puts it) overstates, and often dramatically overstates, the importance of campaign finance.<br /><br />One topic he covers, however, is one where I've become increasingly pessimistic over time: the way that raising money eats into the lives of elected officials. It's something that Mark Schmidt <a href="http://www.nextnewdeal.net/now-we-are-way-too-excited-about-campaign-finance-skepticism">raised</a> in response to Klein's original item, and it's correct. It's absolutely ridiculous for Members of Congress to have built for themselves an expectation that they should spend four hours a day raising money.<br /><br />(By the way: we have good reporting that such an expectation exists, and good reporting that Members spend way too much time raising money...but I have to admit I'm pretty skeptical of this four hours a day business. Do they really do that, day in, day out? Or do most of them reluctantly do a lot less (although still enough to cut way too much into their real jobs), but exaggerate it for the reporter's notebook? Again, I'm not denying that it's a big deal; just questioning the specific claim).<br /><br />I used to believe that a <a href="http://prospect.org/article/how-prevent-another-irs-scandal">campaign regime of floors-not-ceilings</a> would help; by allowing candidates to raise money in larger chunks, they could reach their fundraising goals in far fewer hours of work. And given diminishing returns (that is, in that more spending produces relatively fewer and fewer votes), the incentive to just use the same time but raise more money wouldn't be all that high. I think that was, alas, wishful thinking. The evidence seems to be that they all raise whatever they can, even if it's a waste of their time. Moreover, if floors-not-ceilings succeeded in bringing viable candidates to more districts, even more incumbents would be even more obsessed with the theoretical possibility of a future plausible nominee who had to be scared away by building even larger warchests.<br /><br />The only things I can really imagine that would de-escalate all of this, other than full public financing, would be ways of reducing the pain of losing re-election. But surely that's a cure worse than the disease; we want our Members of Congress to be paranoid about losing. We just want them to deal with it by working hard to represent their districts, not by working the phones to scrape up every last available dollar for their campaigns.<br /><br />Oh, and apart from the other reasons I don't like full public financing, it's a pipe dream anyway, both politically and, with any plausibly foreseeable Supreme Court, Constitutionally.<br /><br />All of which leaves me stumped about what to do with this very real problem.

One Small Point on ACA Implementation<----->I have a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/05/27/ignore-those-polls-obamacare-edition/">post up</a> at Plum Line about a familiar topic to regular readers here -- that Affordable Care Act polling now is unlikely to predict much about how people will react to the law once it's implemented.<br /><br />I'll add one more point, however. There's a possible press bias involved which might help the ACA. For the most part, the people who are helped the most the Obamacare -- people who did not have health insurance, wanted it, and will be able to get it through the exchanges, in many cases with subsidies that really will make it affordable -- are not opinion leaders. There's one exception, however: freelance political reporters, bloggers, and columnists should be big winners from the ACA, and can make a fair amount of noise.<br /><br />Now, of course, if Obamacare really does turn out to be a disaster, that won't matter much -- indeed, if full-time employees of large newspapers and magazines wind up losing insurance and the exchanges are difficult to navigate and deliver an inferior product, then the press will collectively wind up turning against the program. But if that's the case, it won't really matter, because everyone will hate ACA if it's an across-the-board disaster.<br /><br />I've talked before about another bias which should hurt Obamacare approval after implementation; the press tends to have a bad news bias, in which things functioning smoothly is boring and therefore not news, while glitches and snafus make for good stories. And we've already seen, and should see more of Republicans blaming anything that ever goes wrong with anyone's health care or insurance on Barack Obama and the Democrats. So I have no idea how big a deal this counter-bias might be, but it's at least worth a little mention as implementation continues.
Memorial Day<----->I'll mostly be over at Greg's place today, but wanted to pop in at least once to wish everyone a nice Memorial Day.<br /><br />I'll contribute one item, really a follow-up to the weekend questions. There was one new coalition death in Afghanistan recorded yesterday. It was the first one in ten days -- ending a streak which had dramatically improved the <a href="http://icasualties.org/OEF/index.aspx">pace of May casualties</a> after a very disappointing first half of the month. The death yesterday put this month's coalition total up to 25. That's the highest this year (and in fact the highest since September), but that's to be expected given the seasonal nature of the war in Afghanistan. More promising is that May will wind up down from the 45 coalition deaths last year. There have been 67 coalition fatalities to date in 2013; last year, there were 183 through the end of May. There's still a plausible chance that coalition deaths will wind up under 200 for 2013.<br /><br />There are (at least) two obvious interpretations of Barack Obama's policy with respect to all of this. The negative one is to question whether any of these deaths are in the service of anything more than a graceful exit; given that Obama continues to <a href="http://xpostfactoid.blogspot.com/2013/05/another-rung-down-for-afghan-good-enough.html" rel="nofollow">define the mission down</a>, John Kerry's famous question would seem to apply here just as much as it applied to Iraq.<br /><br />The positive interpretation would be that Obama has shown a solid pattern of actually following up on his stated plans to withdraw, even if it opens him up to criticism for "retreating" or for losing a war which (supposedly) was about to be decisively won. That interpretation would also give Obama credit for how difficult it is to turn the boat around, and stress that at least for now it appears that the Obama Administration will have successfully ended two wars and started no new ones. Remember, a lot of people in 2008-2009 believed that the US would find a way to keep a major troop presence in Iraq; that didn't happen.<br /><br />(Yes, Libya, and yes, drone wars...but even there Obama displays an impressive ability to avoid escalations and to move to end things).<br /><br />Is one of these interpretations correct? I don't know; perhaps they both are.
Sunday Question for Liberals<----->At this point: how much, if any, do you trust Barack Obama on national security issues? I'm talking here about trust, not about whether you support or oppose his stated policies...in other words, if there's incomplete information, do you give him the benefit of the doubt, or not?
Sunday Question for Conservatives<----->I've said that the fate of the immigration bill depends on whether mainstream conservatives in the House Republican conference want it to pass or not. Most of them won't have to vote for it (ultimately, Democrats are going to vote for any comprehensive immigration that can get through the Senate), but John Boehner won't put something on the floor if they don't want him to.<br /><br />So: first, what do you think they'll choose to do? And, what should they do?
May 23, 1973<----->One upshot from Nixon's May 22 statement was that Silber and Glanzer advised the new Watergate special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, that Richard Nixon should be on the list of witnesses to be questioned.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a rare break in the tone of Watergate: Tony Ulasewicz, the bagman of the hush money payoffs, testifies to the Ervin Committee and <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB0A15F8395C1A7A93C6AB178ED85F478785F9">breaks everyone up</a>. In a story which produced more than it's fair share of characters, Ulasewicz, the former New York City cop who Nixon's White House had hired as in-house private investigator, was the most comical.<br /><br />Inside the White House, Nixon and Haig are pleased with the May 22 statement -- and Nixon continues to rail against John Dean, and worry about Dean, and worry about the Walters memos on the intervention to get the CIA to turn off the FBI: "Those are really very bad. But what the hell can you do about it?"<br /><br />He also talks to Rose Mary Woods, his longtime secretary, about Thomas Pappas -- that Pappas should have his story straight about Nixon's supposed lack of knowledge about what Pappas was raising money for.
What Mattered This Week?<----->There's a new judge on the DC Circuit, the first one nominated by Barack Obama. That's going to matter. I'll add that the developments over nominations and Senate reform matter more generally, although it's still too early to know how they will turn out.<br /><br />I'm inclined to think that the McCain/Cruz feud won't turn out to matter much. I certainly don't think it matters whether or not Congress goes to a formal conference committee on the budget.<br /><br />That's what I have. What about you? What do you think mattered this week?
May 22, 1973<----->(Sorry, behind again, that kind of week...)<div><br /></div><div><a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=3855">Nixon issues a statement</a>:</div><div><a name="more"></a><div><br /></div><div>---</div><div><br /></div><div>RECENT news accounts growing out of testimony in the Watergate investigations have given grossly misleading impressions of many of the facts, as they relate both to my own role and to certain unrelated activities involving national security.</div><div><br /></div><div>Already, on the basis of second- and third-hand hearsay testimony by persons either convicted or themselves under investigation in the case, I have found myself accused of involvement in activities I never heard of until I read about them in news accounts.</div><div><br /></div><div>These impressions could also lead to a serious misunderstanding of those national security activities which, though totally unrelated to Watergate, have become entangled in the case. They could lead to further compromise of sensitive national security information.</div><div><br /></div><div>I will not abandon my responsibilities. I will continue to do the job I was elected to do.</div><div><br /></div><div>In the accompanying statement, I have set forth the facts as I know them as they relate to my own role.</div><div><br /></div><div>With regard to the specific allegations that have been made, I can and do state categorically:</div><div><br /></div><div>1. I had no prior knowledge of the Watergate operation.</div><div><br /></div><div>2. I took no part in, nor was I aware of, any subsequent efforts that may have been made to cover up Watergate.</div><div><br /></div><div>3. At no time did I authorize any offer of executive clemency for the Watergate defendants, nor did I know of any such offer.</div><div><br /></div><div>4. I did not know, until the time of my own investigation, of any effort to provide the Watergate defendants with funds.</div><div><br /></div><div>5. At no time did I attempt, or did I authorize others to attempt, to implicate the CIA in the Watergate matter.</div><div><br /></div><div>6. It was not until the time of my own investigation that I learned of the break-in at the office of Mr. Ellsberg's psychiatrist, and I specifically authorized the furnishing of this information to Judge Byrne.</div><div><br /></div><div>7. I neither authorized nor encouraged subordinates to engage in illegal or improper campaign tactics.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>--</div><div><br /></div><div>There is no evidence that the first point is inaccurate.</div><div><br /></div><div>Each of the other claims was clearly false in whole or in part.</div><div><br /></div><div>The statement continues, at length, mainly attempting to make the case that the Plumbers activities, and other White House operations, were set up as legitimate national security activities. This is probably an accurate rendering of what Nixon and the others believed -- but in fact, as Nixon well knew, the "White House horrors" often had much less to do with national security than with domestic political opposition.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Meanwhile, at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, the Watergate Committee hearings resumed: McCord continued his testimony, followed by Jack Caulfield:</div><div><br /></div><div>--</div><div><br /></div><div>In early January of 1973, I was attending a drug conference in San Clemente, California when I received a telephone call in my hotel room from John Dean. He asked that I go outside the hotel and call him back from a public telephone, which I did. He told me that he had a very important message which he wanted me to deliver to James McCord, that Mr. McCord was expecting to hear from me and McCord would understand&nbsp;</div><div><div>what the message referred to. He said the message consisted of three things:&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>1. "A year is a long time;"&nbsp;</div><div>2. "Your wife and family will be taken care of;"&nbsp;</div><div>3. "You will be rehabilitated with employment when this is all over."&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I immediately realized that I was being asked to do a very dangerous thing and I said to Mr. Dean that I did&nbsp;</div><div>not think it was wise to send me on such a mission since Mr. McCord knew, as many others did, that I had&nbsp;</div><div>worked closely with Mr. Dean and Mr. Ehrlichman at the White House and therefore it might be quickly&nbsp;</div><div>guessed that any messages I was conveying were probably from one of the two. The reason I raised this question with him was because, frankly, I did not wish to convey the message. Mr. Dean asked if I could think of any other way to do it and I suggested that perhaps I could get Mr. Ulasewicz to convey the message over the telephone anonymously, stating that the message came from me. Mr. Dean felt this would be alright so I hung up the telephone and called Mr. Ulasewicz in New York. He did not wish to convey the message at first but I convinced him to do it merely as a matter of friendship to me. Mr. Ulasewicz called Mr.&nbsp;</div><div>McCord's home, and presumably, delivered the same message that Mr. Dean had given to me. He then called me back, in California, and reported that he had delivered the message and that Mr. McCord's attitude had been one of satisfaction ...&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div></div><div>--</div><div><br /></div><div>Again: most of the main points being spun out in the hearing room were not new, but the details were, and the faces and voices of the witnesses were generally new. Again: it was excellent theater; McCord, for example, showed how to bug a telephone.</div><div><br /></div><div>At the same time, much of what McCord and Caulfield were saying either implicated mid- or low-level people, or were hearsay, or both. But the hearings certainly were getting everyone's attention.</div>
Rebranding? No. But Get Ready to Govern<----->Paul Waldman has a nice post today about <a href="http://prospect.org/article/do-parties-really-need-rebrand-themselves">GOP "rebranding."</a> He's quite right: ideological shifts, real or perceived, do far less to explain electoral results than basic economic performance and other "retrospective voting" things.<br /><br />In particular: I think it's very likely that a Democrat would have won in 1992 even if there had been no DLC. And I think that at best Democrats have a very narrow national advantage based on perceived Republican extremism, almost certainly smaller than the presidential vote margin in 2008 and 2012.<br /><br />However, as I've said before: that doesn't mean that party reform isn't necessary. If it's really true that Republicans have become "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/05/24/post-policy-house-republicans-double-their-priority-agenda/">post-policy</a>" -- both indifferent to public policy choices in many cases, and incapable (or at least severely challenged) in devising complex policy -- then their ability to govern will be compromised. Indeed, in my view, that's a large part of what went wrong during the George W. Bush years. To begin with, Republicans nominated a president ill-suited for the policy demands of the job without apparently seeing the dangers in that; once he was in office, a Republican Congress too often abdicated its own policy role missed opportunities to nudge the party back on course when policy disasters were looming.<br /><br />To put it bluntly, I think Democratic success in 1992 and 2008, and Republican success in 1980, was basically an accident -- but Republican failure in 2008, and perhaps Democratic failure in 1980, was no accident at all.<br /><br />(1980 is tricky. That Carter was a failure of a president was no accident, as Nelson W. Polsby argued in Consequences of Party Reform. But I'd say it's very much open for argument whether the process which produced Carter's nomination was a consequence of a broken Democratic Party or, perhaps, just a fluke of history. Regardless: I see no reason to believe that Walter Mondale in 1984 or Mike Dukakis in 1988 (or Gerald Ford in 1980 or perhaps Bob Dole in 1996) couldn't have governed successfully).<br /><br />And I think it would have been very difficult for a Republican elected in 2008 or 2012 to govern successfully.<br /><br />So, I do think that Republicans desperately need to reform. But not in order to win.
Explaining John McCain<----->Jonathan Chait <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/05/why-john-mccain-hates-republicans-again.html">considers John McCain's career</a>, on the occasion of McCain's recent Tea Party bashing and immigration bipartisanship, and concludes that it's all about national security:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The basic way to understand McCain is that neoconservative foreign policy is his ideological core. Everything else about his ideology can shift radically depending on his ambitions, circumstances, and whom hes most angry with at any given moment. He favored immigration reform under George W. Bush, abandoned it to refashion himself as a build the dang fence border hawk, and, in the wake of last November, embraced it again...<br /><br />But the foreign policy hawkishness has remained constant.&nbsp;</blockquote>Perhaps. I personally subscribe to the other theory: it's a combination of electoral incentives and personal vendettas.<br /><br />What we need is for a neocon to pick a fight with McCain (to see if he'll go dovish as a reaction) or for some electoral situation in which hawks are at a disadvantage. I don't think either of those has ever happened in his career, or at least I don't think he's perceived belligerence in foreign affairs to be an electoral negative.<br /><br />What both theories have in common is the idea that McCain is largely indifferent about policy at least of outside of national security and foreign affairs. Well, indifferent isn't quite right...McCain can be quite passionate about all sorts of issues while he's engaged in them; it just doesn't seem to be based on any kind of consistent ideology, or even a consistent view on the specific issue.<br /><br />I am wondering how McCain's push for reconciliation with Vietnam counts here. I'd argue that it cuts against Chait's theory and in favor for everything being either electoral or, in this case, personal. I'd also argue that his relatively moderate position on the Chuck Hagel nomination fits my theory better; McCain opposed the first cloture vote and final confirmation, but he provided the key vote for cloture in the second cloture vote. Perhaps because he was more annoyed with Ted Cruz than he was loyal to the neocons. But neither of these is anywhere near conclusive.<br /><br />Anyone else have examples that can help resolve this one?<br />

Sri Srinivasan Confirmed<----->Sri&nbsp;Srinivasan was confirmed unanimously this afternoon, 97-0, &nbsp;for a position on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. He was originally nominated on June 11, 2012 for a <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/JudgesAndJudgeships/JudicialVacancies/CurrentJudicialVacancies.aspx">position vacant since November 1, 2008</a>.<br /><br />So there's one obvious point, and one huge question.<br /><br />The point: yes, it's absolutely ridiculous that a unanimous pick took eleven months. The only somewhat reasonable part of the delay was in the run-up to the 2012 election; it's traditional for the out-party to drag their feet to prevent confirmations just before an election, even though Republicans in this case push that to (and beyond) reasonable limits. But there was a lame duck session; they could have taken care of unopposed nominations then. Or in February, March, or April.<br /><br />The question: having given up on Srinivasan, will Republicans now blockade the remaining three vacancies on the DC Circuit Court, perhaps on the bogus pretext that those judges aren't actually needed? If so, that's something that's almost certainly worth going nuclear over. It's certainly possible, however, that they're only going to target those they consider "extremists" -- and that those will be a small minority of all nominees. Surely that's what Mitch McConnell and the Republicans would claim as the July showdown over obstruction gets closer. But as of now, we don't really know the answer.<br /><br />And for that, yes, it would help if there actually were nominees for those three vacancies.
Dept. of Missing the Point (Kinsley ed.)<----->A wonderful example of the myopia of the deficit scolds...<div><br /></div><div>The background is that Michael Kinsley wrote a particularly bad column last week about "austerity," a key point of which was based on factually incorrect memories of what went wrong in the 1970s; as you can imagine, this earned him plenty of corrections and dismissals from people who used access to accurate economic and government policy statistics.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Kinsley was quite taken aback by this, apparently, and <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/113267/michael-kinsley-vs-anti-austerians#">wrote a follow up to defend himself</a>. Dan Drezner has already <a href="http://drezner.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/05/23/sometimes_a_factual_error_is_just_a_factual_error">pointed out</a> that Kinsley is still relying on the same inaccurate memories that got his first column into trouble, but I actually found a different part of Kinsley II more interesting, in which he thinks he's caught Paul Krugman in a contradiction.</div><div><br /></div><div>Kinsley writes:</div><blockquote class="tr_bq">Paul Krugman takes credit for good economic news whenever it happens. On Krugmans blog site (The Conscience of a Liberal) last week were two bits of prose side-by-side. One was an ad for his latest book, End This Depression Now! How bad have things gotten? the ad asks rhetorically. How did we get stuck in what now can only be called a depression? Right next door is <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/20/where-are-the-deficit-celebrations/">Krugmans gloat about the recent pretty-good economic news</a>. So where are the celebrations, he asks, now that the debt issue looks, if not solved, at least greatly mitigated? Greatly mitigated? By what? Certainly not by anyone taking Paul Krugmans advice. He has been, in his own self-estimate, a lone, ignored voice for reason crying out in an unreasoning universe.</blockquote><div>What's the problem? The linked post by Krugman isn't a gloat about good <i>economic</i> news! It is, to be sure a gloat; it's a gloat about deficits...Krugman goes so far as to call lower deficits "progress," although as I read it he's really just saying that lower deficits should be counted as progress from the point of view of the deficit scolds.</div><div><br />What's happening here is that Kinsley is projecting onto Krugman a classic deficit scold mistake; Kinsley is conflating the federal budget deficit with the economy. Krugman isn't doing that; it's purely Kinsley's invention.</div><div><br /></div><div>It gets, however, to exactly why Kinsley was buried under a large pile of abuse after his first column. Well, in part; the other part, as Krugman <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/the-sloppiness-syndrome/?smid=tw-NytimesKrugman&amp;seid=auto&amp;pagewanted=all">notes elsewhere</a>, is "the existence now of a policy blogosphere...which makes bluffing harder." Say something factually inaccurate these days, and you're going to get slammed; it seems that some pundits who preceded that development find it hard to get used to it.</div><div><br /></div><div>But the other part is conflating the federal budget deficit and the economy is really a pretty big deal. It might even explain, by the way, Kinsley's faulty memories of the 1970s; if bad economic times are synonymous with large budget deficits, then there "must" have been deficits back then. It's less of a argument about deficits <i>causing</i> bad times than a tautology about deficits <i>meaning</i> bad times.</div><div><br /></div><div>And the problem is that outside the myopia of deficit scolds, there are real policy choices about fiscal policy. Which are extremely difficult to make well when a large part of the political culture is trapped inside, well, deficit nonsense.</div>

No, Don't Wait Two Months For Public Opinion Effects<----->Is it worth a post over a headline? I suppose so...that's what people read, after all.<br /><br />Michael Catalini writes over at National Journal today goes over the <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/wait-about-two-months-then-check-the-president-s-approval-rating-20130522">public opinion reaction to Watergate, Iran/Contra, and Lewinsky</a>. His accounting of Iran/Contra and Lewinsky are fine, but he's a bit tripped up on Watergate. I wouldn't bother, but the headline and subhead are awful:<br /><br /><blockquote>Wait About Two Months, Then Check the President's Approval Rating<br /><br />Reagan and Nixon saw their approval ratings drop two months after Iran-Contra and Watergate. Clinton was a different story.</blockquote>Actually, I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/05/21/look-beyond-the-1990s-for-a-full-picture-of-presidential-approval/">wrote about this</a> just yesterday, and it's totally wrong. The actual story on Iran/Contra was that Reagan's approval rating collapsed in the very next Gallup poll -- but it was taken several weeks after Iran/Contra broke, back in the days when Gallup polling was far less frequent. So Catalini gets that right in the body of the story, but the headline writer somehow turned that into two months -- for all we know from the Gallup number, it was instant, but at any rate it's only one month.<br /><br />As for Watergate, Catalini writes:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The break-in at the Watergate occurred in June 1972, five months before Nixon rode to a landslide reelection, but the scandal did not damage his approval ratings until after two aides were convicted of conspiracy in January 1973. Between January and August, his approval rating dropped from 67 percent to 31 percent after the resignation of his top staffers, attorney general and deputy attorney general.&nbsp;</blockquote>However, what is important here is that the cover-up was largely effective up until early March 1973. That's why there was no effect on public opinion! People didn't actually know what "Watergate" was about yet. Specifically, things start unraveling in public with Pat Gray's Judiciary Committee hearings, which began on February 28 and continued well into March. There are plenty of news stories throughout the earlier months, including some pretty important revelations, but it's still a marginal story until then.<br /><br />The point of all this is that we shouldn't expect some sort of delayed reaction to the current scandalmania.<br /><br />Assuming, that is, that the basic facts stay more or less the same. But don't expect continued publicity about the same facts to change public opinion in any dramatic way, and don't expect people to mull it over for a few weeks and then decide they no longer approve of the job Barack Obama is doing. That's not what happened in those other cases, and it's not likely to happen with this one.<br /><br /><br />
Catch of the Day<----->From last evening, actually: Dave Weigel notes that Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Mike Lee have <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/05/21/ted_cruz_and_rand_paul_want_the_senate_to_promise_extra_hard_not_to_raise.html">invented a "tradition"</a> that it takes 60 votes to raise the debt limit. He also makes an excellent point about why most Senators don't want to establish any such tradition:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Nobody likes to have a pro-debt limit vote on the record, so votes to raise it are usually pretty limited and partisan. In 2012, the last time the Senate gave the thumbs-up to a debt limit hike, it got only 52 votes. So the Cruz/Paul/Lee gambit will fail, it's in the interest of most Republicans that it fail, and the rebels get to say they, the proud and lonely few, stood and fought for the right for supermajority debt limit votes.</blockquote>Exactly. The more responsible Senators are, the more they should want debt limit increases by simple majority; that way, at least when they're in the minority they can vote against those increases.<br /><br />Full story on the Senate floor flap, which pitted the Cruz gang against John McCain and Susan Collins, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/gop-moderates-feud-with-conservatives-over-stall-tactics-on-budget/2013/05/21/b60b3500-c262-11e2-914f-a7aba60512a7_story.html">here</a>.<br /><br />I'm not exactly on Cruz's side here, but I do think that the Democratic grandstanding over the GOP refusal to go to conference on the budget is both silly and annoying, although no more silly and a lot less annoying than the old Republican complaint about Senate Democrats and budget resolutions. And I like old-fashioned regular conference committees and wish they were revived. But there's no particular reason that the deal that will need to be struck on budget issues this year will need to be in the context of the budget resolution, and no real reason to think that it's likely to happen there. Basically, getting all worked up about "regular order" is a big waste of time; the real issue is what's going to happen whenever the two parties get together to cut whatever deals they'll make this year -- perhaps a minimal one to get through 2014 appropriations plus the debt limit, perhaps a larger one.<br /><br />But at any rate: nice catch!

Against Democratic Certainty That Republicans Will Go Nuclear Next Time<----->Paul Waldman <a href="http://prospect.org/article/mr-smith-vaporized-fire-thousand-suns">makes a claim that I see all the time</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Let's be realistic here. Unless there's some kind of major upheaval within the Republican party that moves it back to the center, when the day comes that there's a Republican president and a Republican senate, the filibuster will be gone. It won't take a Democratic minority using it with the profligacy Republicans have, either. All it will take is one filibuster on something Republicans care about. Today's Republicans don't care about the institution's traditions, or about what kind of precedent they might set. They care about getting what they want. If you think they won't do it, you haven't been paying much attention to American politics over the last five years.</blockquote>Of course, there's no way to prove this one way or another, certainly not yet. But while I think Republicans have less restraint than Democrats do in violating norms, I think this claim is overstated.<br /><br />After all, we do have some experience with this: Republicans really didn't get rid of the filibuster during the George W. Bush presidency. Are current Republican Senators really all that different than Frist-era Republican Senators? Maybe. Maybe not.<br /><br />In fact, Republicans during the Bush years wound up arguing that judicial filibusters were illegitimate (although enough were willing to cut a deal that nothing was done). They probably didn't care about executive branch nominations because Democrats basically didn't use the filibuster against those, so it wasn't a big deal. Legislation, though, mattered -- and Republicans from 2003 through 2006 did nothing to end filibusters on bills, even though Democrats continued the Bob Dole practice of filibustering all major bills.<br /><br />Would things be different for a Republican Senate in 2017 or 2021? Maybe. On the other hand, the longer they remain in the Senate minority, the more Republican Senators will use strong language in support of rules which allow obstruction. That won't entirely constrain them in the future, as it hasn't completely constrained Democrats who were in those Bush-era Senate minorities, but it will tend to constrain them. It's no surprise that many of those Democrats least enthusiastic about eliminating the filibuster are those who made strong pro-filibuster statements during the years of Republican majorities in the 1990s and 2000s.<br /><br />The basic story of filibuster reform is that there are cross-pressures for Senators between their interests as party members and their interests as individual Senators. It may be true that Republicans are more likely to think of themselves as party members than Democrats are, but I think it's unlikely that Republicans wouldn't be cross-pressured at least to some extent. And that means that they, too, might be reluctant to act.<br /><br />Of course, all that assumes that the filibuster survives intact until Republicans get the White House and a Senate majority. If Democrats have a couple of good election cycles while Tea Partiers continue to gain seats in the Senate at the expense of other conservative Republicans, then that's probably not very likely.

Dynasty Semi-Update<----->Is there a new wave of dynastic politicians coming to Congress?<br /><br />National Journal's Sarah Mimms <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/blogs/hotlineoncall/2013/05/congress-the-next-generation-20">has the story</a>... or, at least, the beginnings of the story, highlighting a bunch of dynastic candidates (Mike Collins, son of Mac; Michelle Nunn, daughter of Sam; Gwen Graham, daughter of Bob, and more) running or considering running in the 2016 cycle.<br /><br />Regular readers will know this is a story I follow. So I'm interested. At the same time, I'd urge caution about concluding that there's a trend here. The way this works is that national reporters are more likely to notice the candidates from famous families who are running or thinking of running, and to collectively overestimate their chances. In this story, we have some candidates who are actually running, others who are being urged to run, and even one who is saying he would like to run when the current incumbent retires -- which, as far as I know, could be in 2014 or could be in 2024.<br /><br />The point is that we're far more likely to hear from the national press that Brendan Johnson (son of retiring Senator Tim) "hasn't ruled out" a campaign than we are to hear that some state senator that no one in Washington has ever heard of has also not ruled out the contest. And so it's easy to get an exaggerated impression of how common dynastic politicians really are.<br /><br />Which isn't to say that the actual number is the correct one, whatever it may be.
Anticipating Nuclear Fallout<----->Sarah Binder wrote last night <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/2013/05/20/is-nuclear-winter-coming-to-the-senate-this-summer/">about the new threats that Harry Reid is making to go nuclear</a>. The first thing you need to know is that if you're at all interested in the filibuster, you need to read everything that Sarah writes. Especially if you read me on it -- if we differ, remember that I'm just a consumer of Congress research: she produces it.<br /><br />To begin with, she emphasizes that the mechanism for majority-imposed reform is far more blunt and uncertain than I (and some others) tend to describe it. That's important.<br /><br />Sarah also argues, also on something that I didn't take into consideration in my posts on this last week: "Republicans can credibly threaten to retaliate procedurally if the Democrats go nuclear. &nbsp;And that might be a far more credible threat than Reids."<br /><br />I have two reactions to this.<br /><br />The first is that a lot of liberals will read dismiss it, claiming that Republicans are already maximizing obstruction. That is incorrect. Only <a href="http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/one_item_and_teasers/nom_wdr.htm">one judicial nomination</a> has been defeated by filibuster&nbsp;during the current Congress; there are also a handful of other judicial and executive branch nominations which probably have not been brought to the floor because Reid doesn't have 60. On the other hand, there's a <a href="http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/one_item_and_teasers/nom_confc.htm">long list</a> of nominations that the Senate has confirmed so far this year. There's also one judicial selection who withdrew after "blue slip" obstruction, but that speaks to Sarah's point: Republicans could make more trouble in other ways than they currently do.<br /><br />Republican obstruction on nominations is unprecedented and, in my view, unjustified. They have invented a 60 vote threshold for virtually all nominations which never existed before 2009. But it is certainly not universal obstruction. It could be much worse under the current rules.<br /><br />On the other hand...<br /><br />I'm very hesitant to disagree with Sarah, but I really don't think much of the retaliation threat. It makes sense to threaten to shut down the Senate, but after majority-imposed reform is imposed, does it makes sense to carry out that threat? I don't think so -- because if it was in the GOP's interest to shut down the Senate, they would be doing it now. In other words, I don't think Republican Senators hold off on more extreme obstruction now because they're nice; I think they do it because they believe it's in their interest. And once they're faced with a new status quo, it would turn out that more less the same incentives apply.<br /><br />Indeed, we've seen this before. Republicans threatened retaliation if Barack Obama used a recess appointment despite the House-forced pro forma sessions during a Senate recess, but when Obama acted the threat of retaliation turned out to be a dud. That doesn't prove that retaliation wouldn't happen this time, but as I said, I'm just skeptical about it. I'm sure there would be a lot of shouting, and there's a good chance there would be some demonstration of something on the Senate floor, but after a few weeks I suspect it would fizzle out. Now, to be fair, one could go back to that quote I'm so fond of from Maltese Falcon about how in the heat of the moment people don't always act in their own best interests. Given that, and just generally, I'd expect managers of the immigration bill to want to get that done before a filibuster battle begins.<br /><br />But overall, I continue to think that the threat of massive retaliation if the Democrats go nuclear -- the threat that Republicans could respond by "shutting down" the Senate -- is a relatively minor factor in the chess game. Still: read Sarah's post in full; while I haven't been convinced, there's every possibility that she's right and I'm wrong on this one.

Sunday Question for Liberals<----->Oh, why not: we're six months away from 2012 Election Day now, and the first 100 days of Barack Obama's second term are long gone. How does everything so far compare to your expectations? Disappointed? About what you expected? Worse? If worse: who do you blame?
Sunday Question for Conservatives<----->What do you think of the job that Darrell Issa has done so far, over the last two plus years, as Chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee? How much confidence to you have in him to do a good job going forward?
May 18, 1973<----->Another big day. The Watergate Committee hearings continue. The most important development of the day, however, is that Elliot Richardson has now <a href="http://f30a10f838551a7493cba8178ed85f478785f9/">chosen a Special Prosecutor: John Kennedy's old Solicitor General, Archibald Cox.</a><br /><br /><a name="more"></a>Earlier in the day, in his Executive Office Building hideaway, the president meets with his old chief of staff.<br /><br />President Nixon: [...] Bob, ... tell me the honest-to-God truth, were we trying to get [CIA's Vernon] Walters and [Acting FBI Director Pat] Gray put together (unintelligible)? If we were, I need to know it...<br /><br />Haldeman: ... [There] was that one meeting, and that's all.[...]<br /><br />President Nixon: As far as that meeting is concerned...people get in here and say we don't want this to go further. Let's find out what the hell the score is. Walters go over and see Gray. Gray said there were CIA people involved, was Mexican money involved? (Unintelligible) I'm more concerned about that -- the Plumbers operation --<br /><br />Haldeman; &nbsp;-- the whole question of where this can lead outside the Watergate. We were not concerned about the investigatino on Watergate.<br /><br />President Nixon: Not at all.<br /><br />Haldeman: We were concerned about the investigation expanding beyond, for reasons that now we have no problem saying, because all that stuff is out.<br /><br />President Nixon: Is out. We'll say that that's exactly the reason.<br /><br />Haldeman: And it is exactly the reason, is because we didn't want the Plumbers operation out.<br /><br />--<br /><br />That's basically correct. It's not quite the whole story; of course the higher-ups at the campaign were directly implicated in Watergate, and Dean, Gordon Strachan, Haldeman, and perhaps Nixon were had some knowledge of the entire campaign "security" and information operation.<br /><br />The conversation continues for some time; they cover, with some fair amount of honesty, the details of the intervention with the CIA -- Haldeman recalls that the FBI already was curious about CIA involvement, for example.<br /><br />It includes, however, one crucial admission, in the context of what to do with the Walters memos:<br /><br />--<br /><br />Haldeman: Then [if he has to testify about the CIA/FBI plot] I've got to say it, and then it sounds like an Ehrlichman or Haldeman defense rather than an offensive of why the thing was really done, which --<br /><br />President Nixon: I ordered the meeting. I directed that you get together, didn't I?<br /><br />Haldeman: Yes, sir, you did.<br /><br />President Nixon: You remember I said get Walters and Helms, remember?<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Haldeman: I said it was the President's wish that Walters call on Gray and suggest to him that since the five burglars had been arrested this should be sufficient and was not (unintelligible) going to be (unintelligible)...<br />[...]<br />Haldeman: [Talking now about the meeting with Helms and Walters] And we were concerned about the investigation going beyond Watergate. I think we've got to admit to that.<br /><br />President Nixon: Absolutely.<br /><br />Haldeman: Because it's true. We were. As a matter of fact, we were concerned and emphasized, and I think Dean probably emphasized to the Justice Department, to Silbert and everybody else, that this should be limited to the Watergate. And Kleindienst probably did too.<br /><br />President Nixon: I did too.<br /><br />Haldeman: And I don't think there's anything wrong with that [...]<br /><br />--<br /><br />I think I've mentioned this before, but again: Haldeman apparently never really accepted that what they had done was obstruction of justice, a crime. Perhaps he did really know and just wouldn't say so, but perhaps he just really didn't understand the difference between normal damage control and covering up a crime -- or, really, multiple crimes.<br /><br />At any rate, they continue on, talking about the hush money without admitting to each other that they quite knew about it. The conversation ends, as many did that money, with Nixon suggesting that perhaps he should resign the presidency, and Haldeman urging him to never even consider it -- just as Haig, and Ziegler, and others were doing constantly.<br /><br />As for the Senate: the first day of hearings received <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10F10F73854137A93CAA8178ED85F478785F9">mixed reviews</a>. Today, however, the first significant witness is called: James McCord. The <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F30F14F838551A7493CBA8178ED85F478785F9">headlines</a> came from his prepared statement which he used in response to a question about his contacts with Jack Caulfield:<br /><br />--<br /><br />A. I have a statement, sir, in this regard.<br /><br />The subject is political pressure on the writer to accept executive clemency and remain silent.<br /><br />Political pressure from the White House was conveyed to me in January, 1973, by John Caulfield to remain silent, take executive clemency by going off to prison quietly, and I was told that while there, I would receive financial aid and later rehabilitation and a job. I was told in a January meeting in 1973 with Caulfield that the President of the United States was aware of our meeting that the results of the meeting would be conveyed to the President, and that at a future meeting there would likely be a personal message from the President himself.<br /><br />--<br /><br />(For more of McCord's testimony, <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0F15F838551A7493CBA8178ED85F478785F9">see here</a>).<br /><br />Much of what McCord had to say -- for example, that John Mitchell had approved Watergate -- was hearsay, as Nixon and his men had counted on for months. Indeed, the Senators pointed that out. But this wasn't a court of law; it was a Senate committee hearing, and the rules were different there. The pattern was set; even if there were no new revelations in the Watergate Hearing testimony, it was good theater, and it was going to be treated as news.<br /><br />It's worth making one comment on that. First, remember that this is before CSPAN and before CNN and the other cable news networks: the fact of live coverage (PBS took everything, and the networks all took some; for example, the Times <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F40814F73854137A93CAA8178ED85F478785F9">reported</a> that on the 18th in New York CBS, NBC, and PBS would have full coverage, and ABC would have some coverage) was a powerful signal that this was important. Second, remember that in these pre-cable, pre-satelite, days, most people had only seen glimpses of these characters up to this point. Even Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Mitchell, key figures in the administration, were far less ubiquitous than they would be today. None of them were regularly seen in extended appearances; outside of the Sundays shows, where would that have happened? Of course, that alone didn't guarantee that the hearings would be a hit, but it did make it more of an event.<br /><br />
What Mattered This Week?<----->Barack Obama's Gallup approval rating is back to 51% today, which is back up to the upper part of the range it's been in for the last couple of months. I'm ready to say that the feeding frenzy of this week didn't matter.<div><br /></div><div>There's some sign that the AP warrants may turn out to really matter in policy. I'm going to go ahead and guess it will, so I'll say that that one matters.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Disagree? Have something else? What do you think mattered this week?</div>
May 17, 1973<----->Sorry, I ducked out and took a little break after all the craziness of March and April. But back to it now.<br /><br />What's been happening?<br /><br /><a name="more"></a><br />In early May, the "Kissinger taps" were back -- it turned out that Daniel Ellsberg had in fact been recorded, despite all previous denials. That was, finally, the last straw for Judge Byrne: he dismissed all charges against Ellsberg.<br /><br />Vernon Walters, it turns out, wrote a series of memos about the White House approach to the CIA in the early days of the cover-up; now the prosecutors are preparing to interview him. The White House has the memos, which certainly implicate Haldeman and Ehrlichman; Walters, of course, doesn't know about the taped conversations in the Oval Office setting it in motion, and neither does Al Haig -- although it's not clear exactly what Haig knows and what he at least suspects. Haig and Nixon talk at great length about the Walters memos during the second week of May, with Nixon making the case for it all being innocent, and Haig at times joining in but at times admitting it's bad for Haldeman and Ehrlichman.<br /><br />There's also, during that week, press stories alleging personal financial irregularities by Nixon. That's going to dog him all the way through; it's tangential to the real story of Watergate, but it's out there, too.<br /><br />Elliot Richardson is up for confirmation as Attorney General. In doing so, he's stressing his independence -- which makes Nixon, and the White House, increasingly worried, especially with the special prosecutor not yet named. They scheme some to try to influence it, but as Haig says to Nixon on May 15, Richardson wants to be "Mr. Clean."<br /><br />There's also continuing worries about loyalty from his now former men. John Ehrlichman, in particular, is a constant source of stress; there's a rumor, for example, at one point that Ehrlichman is going to go after Colson.<br /><br />On the 16th, they learn that Dean has a copy of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huston_Plan">Huston plan</a> with Haldeman's approval -- and Haldeman's memo saying that Nixon approved it. That takes a day scrambling, with Nixon's new lawyer Fred Buzhardt eventually learning that Hoover had spike the Huston plan before it actually ever went into effect.<br /><br />They're still working on the Huston plan on the 17th, but this is also the day that the Senate Watergate Committee begins its televised hearings. They don't know what they're in for:<br /><br />--<br /><br />Buzhardt: They will bore...He's our biggest asset. Ervin.<br /><br />President Nixon: Why?<br /><br />Buzhardt: &nbsp;He conducts terrible hearings, Mr. President.<br /><br />President Nixon: Terrible person to preside?<br /><br />Buzhardt: Yes. He stutters, he stammers -- you can't understand his questions. He garbles them up. It's &nbsp;-- he is not, you know [...] One of the next mistakes he's making is he's going to let the members of the committee only do the interrogation. He is not going to let his counsel interrogate --<br /><br />President Nixon: Thank God.<br /><br />Buzhardt: I breathed a sigh of relief when I found this out....<br /><br />--<br /><br />Later:<br /><br />--<br /><br />Ziegler: I just watched a few minutes of that committee. I'll tell you, it is going to be a farce.<br /><br />President Nixon: Why?<br /><br />Ziegler: Sam Ervin is just a pompous, fat...<br /><br />--<br /><br />And again in the afternoon:<br /><br />--<br /><br />Buzhardt: The Ervin Committee grinds on. They're down to the arresting officer now and going through the tedium of that.<br /><br />President Nixon: Somebody told me it's a very dull show. I haven't looked at it.<br /><br />Buzhardt: It is a very dull show.<br /><br />--<br /><br />It is not, it turns out, a dull show; Sam Ervin is not, it turns out, a buffoon. <br /><br />(And <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2013/05/a-look-back-at-the-senate-watergate-hearings.html">here's a highlights reel from PBS</a>)
Friday Baseball Post<----->It wasn't enough to do a whole cranky blogging thing about, but the NYT Sunday Review thing of people doing a column hooked to their new book -- which has made for quite a few very useless Sunday Review items -- seems to have leaked over onto the sports pages. In this case, this past Sunday, Tom Clavin, who has a book coming out on the DiMaggio brothers, was given the opportunity to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/sports/baseball/vince-joe-and-dom-dimaggio-carved-distinct-legacies.html">argue for Dom DiMaggio as a HOFer</a>. It's full of the cherry picking you expect from this sort of thing:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">During his 10 full seasons, he totaled 1,679 base hits, more than any other major leaguer in that time. The next four players  Enos Slaughter, Stan Musial, Ted Williams and Pee Wee Reese  are all in the Hall of Fame.</blockquote>If you need me to explain what's wrong with that, I'll instead tell you to pick up an old Baseball Abstract and learn from Bill James how to spot a phony argument. It goes on from there...testimony from teammates who thought he was great, more cherry picked stats.<br /><br />Look, <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/dimagdo01.shtml">Dom DiMaggio</a> was a pretty good player. And he lost his prime -- his age 26, 27, and 28 seasons -- to the war.<br /><br />That said...there are certain players who get a reputation for being underrated, and there's nothing you can do to shake it. Dom DiMaggio is an excellent example.<br /><br />Here's the thing: he's not the most deserving Red Sox CF to not be in the Hall. You would think he'd have to manage that, at least, to really merit consideration, no?<br /><br />Let's try this with OPS+, best ten seasons -- something that works well for the guy with only 10 seasons:<br /><br />Dom D &nbsp; &nbsp;123 121 113 110 110 108 107 105 104 102<br /><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/smithre06.shtml">Reggie S</a> &nbsp;168 162 155 150 143 142 137 129 127 127<br /><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lynnfr01.shtml">Fred L</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; 176 162 142 137 133 132 130 129 118 117<br /><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/burksel01.shtml">Ellis B</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;163 149 139 137 132 128 128 122 114 113<br /><br />DiMaggio does have a couple edges over the others. He was much healthier -- I used a fairly low PA cutoff to include seasons, and if I had used 500 then he loses the 110 season but the others lose more. And he was in CF for 1338 of his 1373 defensive games, while the others all moved to corner positions, and eventually to DH or 1B. Reggie Smith had a bit over 800 games in CF; Ellis Burks had 1061; Fred Lynn, however, had almost 1600.<br /><br />Really, however, there's just no way that the defensive position adjustment is going to make up for the huge gap at the plate. I'll go ahead and give you baseball reference's one-number stat...I'd take small differences here with a huge grain of salt, but c'mon: DiMaggio 31.8, Smith 64.4, Lynn 49.9, Burks 49.5. Dom's best season scores out as a 5.1...he would have to average 6 wins a year for his three missing years, averaging a full game better than his actual best year, to get to where Lynn and Burks are. But it's worse: that 5 win season was 1942 -- a war year. Not the worst of it, but still, he's not competing against the best that year.<br /><br />I mean, he's missing what could easily have been his prime years. Maybe he goes nuts and has a 9 win year if there's no war. Maybe this fielding system is shortchanging him. Maybe...but you just can't come anywhere close to a strong HOF case. I mean...I didn't even mention Red Sox CF Johnny Damon (56 WAR).<br /><br />What I really would like to put together is a team of guys who don't rate the HOF, aren't in it, and yet have a significant cheering section for their candidacies.<br /><br />1B Gil Hodges<br />2B ?<br />SS Marty Marion<br />3B Ken Keltner?<br />LF Tony Oliva (yeah, I'm moving him over)<br />CF Dom DiMaggio<br />RF Roger Maris<br />C &nbsp; Thurmond Munson<br />P &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack Morris<br /><br />Does anyone really think that Keltner belongs? And I couldn't think of a 2B, or a proper LF, and Morris (alas) isn't going to last on this list for long. Beat my list!
Elsewhere: Campaign Finance, Leaks, More<----->I don't think I've done one of these all week...I was waiting for some columns to go live, but I guess I'll go ahead now with at least one of them up.<br /><br />So: at TAP today, I <a href="http://prospect.org/article/how-prevent-another-irs-scandal">make the case</a> for floors, not ceilings, and strong disclosure. I used to think it had the added virtue of being a good compromise between the Democratic and Republican positions, but that's before Republicans flipped on disclosure (they're now mostly against). Not that it was ever all that likely to ever happen anyway.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/05/14/hey-mr-presidents-stop-worrying-about-leaks-and-start-listening-to-them/">best thing</a> I wrote all week, I think, is one at PP on the topic of leaks -- saying that presidents should stop worrying about leaks and start listening to them.<br /><br />I also <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/05/13/scandals-scandals-and-2014/">looked at</a> the effects of the scandals on 2014; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/05/16/why-obamas-popularity-still-matters/">discussed</a> why Barack Obama's popularity still matters; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/05/15/on-the-benghazi-talking-points/">dismissed</a> the Benghazi talking points as important; and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/05/17/whats-next-for-immigration-reform-a-roadmap/">sketched out</a> the path for immigration.<br /><br /><br /><br />
Time for Some Nominations. A Lot of Nominations<----->(UPDATED)<br /><br />Today's news, outside of the continuing scandal stuff, is Greg Sargent's big scoop that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/05/17/harry-reid-eyeing-july-for-the-nuclear-option/">Harry Reid is tentatively planning for July to be nominations month</a> -- complete with the threat of majority-imposed reform. I already wrote about it <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/05/17/here-comes-the-filibuster-battle/">as a chess move</a> over at PP today (I think Reid did well), and I probably should write something at some point about what the substance of the threat in terms of Senate rules and procedures. But there's one more point that's important to get to:<br /><br />If Harry Reid is willing to spend serious floor time on nominations, he needs more nominees. Lots more nominees.<br /><br />In particular, he really needs those three DC Circuit Court selections that the president still -- still! -- hasn't sent up. Okay, there's some excuse on one spot because he had a nominee who was defeated by filibuster. But still, that cloture vote was ten weeks ago, and she withdrew her name almost two months ago (and it's not as if the cloture vote defeat was a big surprise, either).<br /><br />But that's not all! Reid needs Obama to supply a full complement of executive branch nominees. Yes, as Greg points out, the high-visibility slots are the head of EPA, Secretary of Labor, and the nullification case of CFPB. There's also a Commerce Secretary nominee to confirm, and a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/14/nlrb-labor-board-nominations_n_3273280.html?utm_hp_ref=politics">full set of NLRB nominees</a>. There should be, however, far more. With Reid signaling a window of available floor time, it sure would be nice to have as full a slate as possible of subcabinet executive branch nominations for the Senate to confirm.<br /><br />And, yes, as many of the other 50-plus judicial nominees as possible.<br /><br />To get all of those picks through committee and ready for the Senate floor in July, they really need to be selected very soon. C'mon, Mr. President: it's time for a fully functioning administration, and that takes executive branch nominees.<br /><br /><br />UPDATE: I should note that in the last couple of weeks the White House really has been starting to roll out more judicial picks -- one <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/16/president-obama-nominates-judge-carolyn-b-mchugh-serve-united-states-cou">circuit court selection</a>&nbsp;and three <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/16/president-obama-nominates-three-serve-united-states-district-court">district court selections yesterday</a>, on top of a few last week. That's good! But there's a lot more to go. And plenty of executive branch vacancies as well.
Attention Civics Teachers<----->I mentioned that we had local election in Texas this past weekend...<a href="http://www.expressnews.com/news/local_news/article/1-0-vote-in-race-highlights-low-turnout-in-Lytle-4509664.php">here's one result I missed that may be of interest</a>. One of the small-town school boards around here had a one-vote election. No, not a one-vote margin...well, that too. A one vote election.<br /><br />It happened in the Lytle school district, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lytle,_Texas">Lytle, Texas</a>. It's a small town to begin with, population about 2400, although the school district must be bigger -- there are apparently 1700 students involved. Local elections normally include city council and tax measures as well as school board, but none of the council elections were contested, so they were canceled, and no tax measures were needed this time. So it was just the school board, with only two contested districts out of seven total. And in one of those, only one person bothered to vote.<br /><br />The candidates? The rules say they don't need to live in their districts, and as it happens neither winner Christina Mercado or loser Patty Cortez did live there.<br /><br />There wasn't a recount -- would have been fun! -- but there was <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local_news/article/1-0-outcome-stands-in-Lytle-ISD-race-4520548.php">some suspense</a> in the form of one provisional ballot, which turned out to have been cast by someone outside of the district, and thus not allowed.<br /><br />I suppose if you want to look at this from a elections policy angle, I'd probably question why these local elections can't be on the same day as the general election. On the other hand, since there's no account of either candidate actually campaigning, it's not as if a larger general election day electorate would have been making a more informed decision on what is (I'm pretty sure) a nonpartisan election.<br /><br />But anyone who wants to tell stories about why one vote might make a difference: clip and save this one from Lytle.
Read Stuff, You Should<----->Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0314253/">Peter Gerety</a>, 73.<br /><br />And the good stuff:<br /><br />1. Sean Trende on <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/05/16/why_the_gop_lost_the_vote_but_gained_house_seats__118430.html">House districts and the GOP advantage</a>. No, not gerrymandering.<br /><br />2. Good Ed Kilgore <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2013_05/the_tired_tired_complaints_aga044781.php">on "political correctness."</a> As I've said: most of this is all about conflating politics and etiquette. Be polite, and most of the problem melts away.<br /><br />3. An employer survey shows <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/16/obamacare-employers_n_3286508.html?1368733728">minimal planned changes in reaction to ACA kicking in</a> -- very few intend to drop insurance or to fire or hire in order to game the system; the biggest planned change has to do with manipulating workers hours to keep them from qualifying, but even there it's not all that many employers. Jeffrey Young reports. The same caution applies here, however, that applied to less optimistic earlier reports: there could be big gaps between planning and doing (in either direction), and there could be huge gaps between changes attributed to ACA and changes actually caused by reform.<br /><br />4. Nice update from Abby Rapoport about <a href="http://prospect.org/article/five-voting-fights-you%E2%80%99ll-care-about-come-election-time">what's going on in the state legislatures on voting</a>.<br /><br />5. Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2013/05/john-holbo-reads-national-review-for-the-kevin-williamson-humor-centerfold.html">on Kevin Williamson</a>...well, actually Kevin Williamson on Kevin Williamson, via DeLong. <br /><br />6. And I stepped out yesterday, and all of a sudden everyone was talking "Bulworth." <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2010/03/monday-movies-post.html">I love Bulworth</a> -- it's very, very, funny, and has other virtues as well. Anyway, Ezra Klein has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/16/if-obama-went-bulworth-heres-what-hed-say/">the president Bulworthing</a>. Okay, but if it doesn't rhyme, I'm not sure it counts.
Ignore the Twitter News Cycle on Scandals<----->On Tuesday, they were measuring out the president's tomb. Today, with no big revelations on any of the current scandals (or "scandals" as the case may be), liberals at least, and I get the sense much of the neutral press, is almost ready to announce<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/16/the-scandals-are-falling-apart/"> the whole thing a dud</a>.<br /><br />They were wrong on Tuesday; they're wrong today. The truth? We mostly don't know what will happen.<br /><br />Look, the Benghazi thing remains, as far as I'm concerned, just as big a nothing as it's been all along; the talking points, which have been the GOP focus, just don't matter. That said, however, there's nothing that's happened which makes it likely that Republicans are going to give up on Benghazi. And if they keep pushing, they'll eventually have another day somewhere down the road where neutral reporters will get tempted to buy back in on the "where there's smoke" theory.<br /><br />As far as the IRS mess ..well, it's absolutely possible that we know pretty much everything that will matter. On the other hand -- there's going to be a serious investigation on the IRS, and Congressional hearings. There's no way of knowing, at this point, whether there's anything else to find out or not. The IG report (as one conservative tweeted today; sorry, don't remember who) is not necessarily the final word; it's really not hard to imagine any number of fresh revelations that could emerge which could make the scandal much worse, without resorting to far-fetched scenarios. I'm not predicting it will; just saying that there's absolutely no reason to guess one way or the other what an investigation will show.<br /><br />The same is basically true about the AP/DoJ story, although there it's less a case of discovering what happened in this particular case and whether it was kosher than of deep press interest in keeping the story alive. Still, a live story means reporters actively digging for something to justify it. They might find stuff!<br /><br />Again: I'm not predicting very much here, other than that Republicans are almost certainly going to stick with Benghazi and IRS regardless of what they find, and that the press is likely to behave the way they always behave -- which includes love of scandals. But I didn't get around to writing a "calm down, relax, be patient" post about all this back on Monday and Tuesday when the press was freaking out, and that kind of thing is still just as worth saying to the extent that they're now ready to declare the whole thing over.<br /><br />Real investigations don't conform to twitter news cycles. Or even the old 24-hour news cycles. Just remember, when you're consuming the news, that you're reading a lot of people who have massive incentives and norms that involve rushing to judgement on everything. Be aware of it, and be ready to fight it.
Presidential Approval Probably Isn't Stuck At Midrange<----->Ezra Klein <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/14/alan-abramowitz-its-ridiculous-to-call-these-scandals-game-changers/">poses a hypothesis </a>I've heard a few times before at the end of a nice post earlier this week:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Tucked inside Abramowitzs take is an interesting structural prediction about American politics: As party polarization increases and the persuadable middle dwindles, scandals and gaffes will become less meaningful as theyll only be able to convince those who want to be convinced. Its not clear that the IRS mess, Benghazi, or the DoJ/AP issue will rise to the level of being a useful test of this thesis. But something will.</blockquote>It's tempting to believe that polarization is producing presidential approval results which are little more than reflections of partisanship. Barack Obama's Gallup approval history would seem to suggest that might be happening. His best rating of 69% ranks 10th best of the 12 presidents in the Gallup era, and is really in a tie for last with Nixon (67%), Reagan (68%), and perhaps Ford (71%). Everyone else had higher highs. And yet, at least to date, Obama's lowest point of 38% approval beats everyone but Ike and Kennedy. Obama's overall average to date is 49%; since the beginning of 2012, his weekly Gallup number has ranged higher than 55% and lower than 45% only once in each direction, and overall, outside of a brief honeymoon in 2009, he's been in that range almost his entire presidency.<br /><br />And yet...there's no reason to believe that polarization has advanced significantly in the last fifteen years, but George W. Bush's approval ratings were all over the place. Bush holds the highest spike in the history of Gallup, hitting a soaring 90%. And when he crashed, Bush bottomed out at 25%, lower than everyone but Truman and Nixon. Bush's first term was, overall, fourth-highest (and also fourth farthest from 50%); his second term is tied for second-lowest (and also tied for second farthest from 50%).<br /><br />Conclusion? Most likely, Obama's approval ratings have stayed in a narrow range mainly because there really haven't been that many events, and those that have happened have roughly balanced out. The economy has mostly been the same from 2010 on -- recovering, but not recovering enough to get people thinking "prosperity." The same, really, with foreign affairs; with the exception of the bin Laden killing, the administration can't really offer peace, but also isn't running up the level of policy disaster that occurred during the Bush presidency...good news (out of Iraq! overall casualties in Afghanistan way down!) seem to be balanced by bad (Benghazi -- the real event, not the phony scandal; the Boston bombing; various high-profile attacks in Afghanistan).<br /><br />Granted, it could be that it's harder for events now to move the needle, but the reaction to events during the Bush administration just makes me very skeptical of that.<br /><br />
Read Stuff, You Should<----->Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004770/">David Boreanaz</a>, 44. Totally impossible for me to get my mind around the idea that there are people who think of him as the guy from Bones; he still has a few more episodes as Angel, but not very many. Angel is my least favorite of the Whedon TV shows, but I am happy to see that Gunn is going to be on the Avengers show. Excellent.<br /><br /><br />Oh, I shouldn't forget the good stuff:<br /><br />1. I only have a very plain blog, full of what are apparently technically called text-heavy pieces of content.

Only one quibble, really: I still think the torture episode of Next Generation is pretty awful. He underrates the Kirk series, but I'll give him that on changing tastes and standards over time. He nailed the movies, though. Maybe I'd put First Contact a bit higher, but no real complain there. I do think, on his main essay, that the quote that best captures the Star Trek idea is the cultural imperialism speech that Quark makes at one point <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001518/quotes">about root beer and the Federation</a>.
Harry Reid and Senate Reform<----->Brian Beutler has <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2013/05/reid-no-precipitous-nuclear-option-but-consumer-watchdog-will-get-vote-next-week.php">the latest on Harry Reid's current plans, or at least his current rhetoric</a>.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Reids decision to eschew significant reforms to Senate filibuster rules at the beginning of the current Congress  and his continuing reluctance to revisit those rules despite recent filibusters of cabinet nominees  angers allies both on and off of Capitol Hill.<br /><br />But he continues to approach the issue cautiously.<br /><br />Im not going to do anything now, precipitously, he said. But Im looking at this very closely. Were going to fill that job. Cordray is there now. Hes going to get a vote.<br /><br />Reid wasnt able to explain why he believes (or claims to believe) Cordray will ultimately be confirmed. But he alluded to the possibility that he may pursue a rules change mid-session.</blockquote><br />Good reporting, but I'll make two points about it.<br /><br />1. One of the pieces here is that Harry Reid has to educate everyone, contrary to the conventional wisdom pushed in large part by reformers over the past few years, to the reality that the rules can be changed during a session of Congress. Probably necessary if he wants to get buy-in from editorial boards and good government types. As is really demonstrating just how bad the problem is in ways they can understand -- remember that numerous reporters claimed that the Hagel nomination was the first to be filibustered during Obama's presidency, despite the plain fact that every nomination has been filibustered during Obama's presidency.<br /><br />2. Don't assume that Harry Reid has a lot of autonomy here. Even Speakers of the House must be responsive to their conference, but Senate Majority Leaders really just don't wield all that much influence. They are servants of their caucus, not masters of it. Reid can't do anything at all here without 51 of the 55 Democrats, and if (again) he wants to keep the good government folks on his side, he's going to need all or almost all of those with him. And if they don't want to? He has very few ways to influence them.<br /><br />Worth repeating: the bottom line here is that almost every Democrat would prefer an outcome that allows most nominations to pass by simple majority vote while leaving the basic filibuster rules intact. They probably prefer eliminating the filibuster to complete and total obstruction...but there's almost certainly some point at which partial obstruction is more acceptable for them than reform. And that's a reasonable position!<br /><br />And of course, the level of obstruction, while unprecedented and thoroughly unjustified, is still not total. And it's not even clear what the level is at any particular time.<br /><br />All of which makes Harry Reid's job a lot more difficult than it might seem.<br />
Young Voting Update<-----><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/takoma-park-grants-16-year-olds-right-to-vote/2013/05/14/b27c52c4-bccd-11e2-89c9-3be8095fe767_story.html">Takoma Park, Maryland, has gone ahead: they've lowered the voting age for local elections to 16</a>. Excellent.<br /><br />We're talking a suburb of 17K citizens, so it's not exactly a ton of 16 and 17 year old voters. Not to mention that giving them the vote only for local elections isn't exactly likely to produce stampedes at the polling places. Still, it's something. More about the case for teen voting <a href="http://prospect.org/article/making-sweet-sixteen-even-sweeter">here</a>.<br /><br />What we really could use is a state deciding to give this a try for all elections. Who wants to step up? Hey, state legislators -- here's an issue available for you which could attract a fair amount of publicity. Someone step up and give it a try!

Catch of the Day<----->So many "scandals," so many silly analogies -- but Steve Benen appears to be&nbsp;<a href="http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/05/14/18251297-its-not-even-bigger-than-iran-contra?lite">exactly correct</a> about Lamar Alexander's <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/14/lamar-alexander-sebelius-fundraising-arguably-an-even-bigger-issue-than-iran-contra/">ridiculous comparison</a> between Iran-Contra and Obama Administration efforts to raise money for publicizing options under the ACA. Benen:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">In order for Alexander's comparison to make sense, here's what would have happened: imagine Obama asked Congress to approve the Affordable Care Act, but instead, Congress did the opposite, approving a measure ordering the president not to change the existing the health care system. Obama, undaunted, sold weapons to North Korea and then used the profits to do the opposite of what Congress instructed.</blockquote>That sounds about right.<br /><br />Benen's whole post is good, but I'll expand some of the history, anyway. He notes that there's plenty of precedent for public-private partnerships in these kinds of cases. Alexander's point is that if Congress doesn't fund it, the government can't pay for it. That's correct -- but that's not relevant here, since what HHS is doing is finding funds for a private entity ("Enroll America"), not a government agency. Alexander thinks that doesn't matter because the Contras were also a private agency, but the major difference is that in the 1980s the Boland Amendment and other law <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Research/Understanding_the_Iran_Contra_Affair/n-contrasus.php">specifically prohibited the government from doing anything to help the Contras</a>; the narrower issue of Iran-Contra was whether that prohibition applied to National Security Council staff. In this case, while Congress didn't supply any money for HHS to fund Enroll America, they did not specifically tell HHS that it couldn't implement the law as part of their normal responsibilities.<br /><br />At any rate, Alexander has forgotten even more: the <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/02/dept-of-phony-reaganreal-reagan-examples.html">larger problem of Iran-Contra</a> wasn't that the administration was raising private funds for the Contras; it was that the Reagan Administration retailed weapons to Iran and then used the profits elsewhere. That's not the executive raising money from the private sector for something in the private sector; that's the executive generating new funds that they control and that Congress can't touch. Indeed, the real scary part of Iran-Contra (and here, I'm working from memory) was the idea that this could be self-sustaining; the executive branch could develop permanent funding streams that Congress would have nothing to do with. That would indeed upset the Constitutional balance, and that's probably the core of why Iran-Contra was such a large scandal.<br /><br />And back to Benen's point: unlike the Contra war, which Congress opposed and was trying to stop, the ACA is actually law; it's the responsibility of HHS to attempt to carry it out as best it can. Certainly, if there's no funding for a specific task, they can't spend money on it. But there's no Congressional prohibition against trying to execute this particular law; indeed, the presumption is exactly the opposite, that HHS has been told by Congress to enact Obamacase as best as it can.<br /><br />And meanwhile: Nice catch!

You Call That a Cover-Up?<----->Obviously, things don't have to be as bad as Watergate to be important malfeasance, but given all the loose talk about "cover-up" and "worse than Watergate" in the context of Benghazi, I figured it was worth just pointing out quickly the general outlines of the Watergate cover-up.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>* The cover-up was essentially directed by the president, overseen by the White House Chief of Staff, and at the operational level run by the White House Counsel.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>* A false story was concocted.</div><div><br /></div><div>* Both at the White House and at the campaign committee, everyone involved destroyed evidence.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>* Low-level people arrested for the initial break-in were paid off to stay quiet; they were also promised pardons (or at least pardons were hinted at). Among those directly involved in directing and raising funds specifically to be used for hush money were the White House Chief of Staff and, probably, the President of the United States.</div><div><br /></div><div>* Others lied to the FBI and to a grand jury; the White House Counsel prepped them for the grand jury so they would stick to the cover story.</div><div><br /></div><div>* The White House counsel also arranged to receive regular briefings from Department of Justice prosecutors, including FBI interview reports, so that the cover-up could stay one step ahead of the law</div><div><br /></div><div>* When that arrangement became public and collapsed, the president himself began receiving regular briefings from the Department of Justice, about their prosecution strategy, including grand jury testimony, which he then shared with targets of the prosecutions. That arrangement only stopped when the president pushed too hard for information, and really only stopped for good when a special prosecutor, beyond the reach of the president, was appointed.</div><div><br /></div><div>* The President of the United States had his chief domestic adviser, the second-ranking White House staffer, order the CIA to tell the FBI to stop the investigation based on a false claim about,</div><div><br /></div><div>* Part of the reason for the cover-up was to protect illegal White House operations (Watergate itself was basically a campaign operation, although with plenty of blurry lines). The president specifically ordered the head of the the Department of Justice Criminal Division not to look into an illegal White House activity based on a false claim of national security.</div><div><br /></div><div>* And that's just the internal story -- the real cover-up. To the public, the Nixon Administration falsely claimed that the White House was not involved in the original crime, falsely claimed that his White House Counsel had carried out an investigation and written a report clearing the White House, and denied several -- maybe dozens -- of specific, true, press reports.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>By the way, I'll stick with what I always say about this: it's the crime, not the cover-up, that gets people in trouble. The reason for the Watergate cover-up was that specific crimes had been committed, crimes which could have (had they been confessed to in June 1972) sent much of the senior White House staff, much of the campaign organization, and perhaps the President of the United States straight to prison.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>And, for those who are not following my Watergate updates, the above does not include the cover-up of the cover-up; once the initial cover-up collapsed in spring 1973, the president then initiated a new cover story which falsely claimed that he himself had not been involved in the cover-up at all. Because, again, the alternative was admitting the truth, which was worse.</div>
Oy, Fournier<-----><a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/benghazi-irs-create-perfect-storm-threatening-obama-s-credibility-20130513">Say what?</a>&nbsp;<blockquote class="tr_bq">Why does this matter? Because a presidents credibility matters. President Bushs second term effectively ended when Americans grew tired of his administrations spinning and dissembling over Iraq and Katrina. They stopped trusting him. They stopped listening to him. He no longer had the moral authority to lead.</blockquote><div>That's Ron Fournier on Benghazi and the IRS story, and it's dead wrong.</div><div><br /></div><div>What hurt, and then destroyed, Bush's approval ratings was very simple: events. There was no way to spin the ongoing policy disaster in Iraq from summer 2003 through, well, pretty much the end of the Bush Administration. There was no way to spin the drowning of a major US city (including the parts of that which were mostly unfair to the administration). There was no way to spin a recession from the end of 2007 on, or the financial disaster in fall 2008.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Generally, if we follow Neustadt, it's better to think of these "credibility gap" arguments has applying mainly to Washingtonians -- people who directly or indirectly deal with the president -- rather than to mass publics. Voters, as such, don't pay close attention to whether the president is trustworthy, at least not as a separate category from whether they think much of him, which in turn is probably not really a separate category from (1) partisanship and (2) events.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>That's easy to see in the presidency of Bill Clinton, right? Clinton certainly lied, and was caught lying, with regard to the Lewinsky scandal. But his popularity went up during that period. Why? Surely not because of his "moral authority to lead!" No, it was because of every president's best friends, peace and prosperity.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Now, obviously, it is possible for scandals to affect presidential popularity -- see Watergate in 1973-1974 and Iran-Contra in 1986-1987. But even then, my guess is that what the presidents did mattered as much as anything -- and of course, with Watergate, the lies were much larger and more consistent than anything that's even been hinted at so far with Obama.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I do think that presidential credibility matters <i>in Washington</i>. By the end of his presidency, neither Democrats nor Republicans really trusted George W. Bush very much, and that mattered -- see, for example, Republican resistance to TARP, among other things. But I think it's the wrong way to think about voter views of the president.</div>
Spurious Impeachment? Probably Not<----->I've been writing about possible impeachment for a long time, and I said back in 2009 that "If Republicans take back the House, the odds are very good that they will impeach Barack Obama. "<br /><br />Here's the thing, though. For all the impeachment talk -- and it's been a constant beginning just a few months into Obama's first term -- the House hasn't actually done anything remotely like that.<br /><br />I think I was wrong, and I think the chances of a spurious impeachment are a lot lower than I thought, and a lot lower than a lot of liberal bloggers now think (<a href="http://prospect.org/article/impeachment-only-matter-time">see Jamelle Bouie today, for example</a>).<br /><br />Two things. One is that I think Republicans, or at least the Republicans in House leadership, really have learned a lesson from the Bill Clinton impeachment. The question, really is which lesson they learned. There's the one from 1998 and 1999 -- &nbsp;spurious impeachment helps the president and hurts the other party. And then there's the one from 2000 -- spurious impeachment, whatever the apparent immediate effect, helps the out-party eventually. I'm fairly confident that John Boehner learned the first of those, which is also (for whatever it's worth) far more likely to actually be true.<br /><br />The second is that I'm not really sure that the incentives run towards impeachment, anyway. I thought they did...now, I'm not so sure. Scandal-mongering, obviously, is very lucrative within the conservative marketplace, and works well for Members of Congress who seek publicity (that's nothing new, of course). But it's not entirely clear to me that actually moving towards impeachment does anything great for most House Republicans. Among other things, and assuming they're not going to start impeaching Obama as often as they vote to repeal Obamacare, actually finishing an impeachment presumably ends whatever scandal they are mongering. It might be better to just keep the witch-hunt going.<br /><br />On the other hand, it's certainly possible that the thing develops its own momentum and becomes difficult for them to stop...House Republicans aren't exactly known for resisting the more crazy impulses of talk radio hosts. Still, on balance I think the final word on this is likely to be John Boehner's demonstrated ability in guiding House Republicans past their worst self-destructive instincts. Would it shock me if there's a spurious impeachment? No. And I certainly expect impeachment talk to continue, whether or not there's any actual evidence of administration malfeasance. But overall, I think I've overstated the chances of the House really going through with it.

Sunday Question for Liberals<----->Mother's Day, also. I know it's impossible to separate this question from whatever one thinks about Hillary Clinton, but give it a try anyway: How important to you is it for the Democrats to nominate a woman for president in 2016? How important is it for you for the Democrats to nominate a woman for VP if they don't select a woman for president?
Sunday Question for Conservatives<----->For Mother's Day...I suspect I've asked this in the past, but since we're in the recruitment season for 2014: Republicans have elected some women governors, but have fallen far behind Democrats in electing women to the House and Senate. Is that a problem? Any idea of why it's happened? What, if anything, should Republicans be doing about it?
What Mattered This Week?<----->I don't know yet whether the IRS scandal will turn out to matter, but it certainly could. I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/05/10/the-irs-scandal-will-test-everyone/">wrote</a> about it yesterday...we're certainly going to get investigations and Congressional hearings, at the very least, so I'll go ahead and say it mattered.<br /><br />And, yeah, I don't really think that this week's Benghazi fuss will turn out to have mattered.<br /><br />What am I missing? What do you think mattered this week?
For Tuesday I Walk to the Village<----->Election Day here in San Antonio. It's been a long time since we've had an opportunity to vote -- a full six months.<br /><br />In my part of town only two items on the ballot -- mayor, where Julian Casto is going to be easily re-elected against a handful of obscure candidates, and an open city counsel seat. That's been a fascinating race: the two major candidates (there's also an obscure one) have been spending lots of money and throwing a lot of mud. Fun! What's really been interesting, however, is that the local newspaper has had a major vendetta against one of them -- must have been a dozen stories about his misdeeds, including several front-pagers. It's really not clear what's going on. Perhaps the guy just really is that ethically awful; perhaps there's something else. Whatever it is, I haven't seen the newspaper crusade like this in any contest in the twelve years I've lived here. Given that turnout for these elections is tiny (under 10%), I suppose that the small minority of dedicated voters probably overlaps quite a bit with newspaper readers, so maybe that matters; the guy the newspaper is attacking has spent more money, and got a late endorsement from the incumbent. Me? I'm voting for the other guy, partially because of endorsements, partially because he seemed nice the time I met him when he was campaigning in the school parking lot on a previous election day and the two (!) times he rang our doorbell, partially because he runs the local <a href="http://web.krtu.org/x4164.xml">fantastic jazz radio station</a>&nbsp;(seriously, if you're looking, you won't do better), and mostly because my wife, who generally makes our decisions on local politics, supports him. So two choices, both for offices that everyone voting understands. That's nice! On the other hand, it's a non-partisan ballot, so you have to look for clues about the candidates...apparently, both of the counsel candidates support sensible growth and are against traffic. The band, I hope.<br /><br />At any rate: this was the first election here of the year, of the two-year cycle, and of the four-year cycle. Two marks on the computer screen and that's it.<br /><br />For dedicated readers of these reports, the best news is that the local elementary school is no longer touting it's slogan: "Ubiquitous!"
Judges, Please<----->Just a quick note that no one is going to notice on a newsy Friday afternoon, but nevertheless it's still important:<div><br /></div><div>We <i>still</i>&nbsp;aren't getting new judicial nominees.</div><div><br /></div><div>Still.</div><div><br /></div><div>It's now been about <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/03/25/president-obama-where-are-the-judges/">nine weeks</a> since the White House convinced some gullible reporters that a flood of judges was coming. Since then, there's been <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/JudgesAndJudgeships/JudicialVacancies/CurrentJudicialVacancies.aspx">barely a trickle</a>. In particular, we're still waiting for the three nominees for the DC Circuit Court.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now, not all of this is Barack Obama's fault. I missed this yesterday, but Jennifer Bendery has a terrific item about a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/09/john-cornyn-judicial-nominees_n_3249403.html">confrontation over judges between John Cornyn, Ted Cruz, and Pat Leahy</a>. Republicans are in fact, in many states, obstructing the normal process of selecting nominees in the first place (and Pat Leahy and the Judiciary Committee Democrats are basically allowing it to happen).&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>However. Not all of the delays are happening in states with Republican Senators. Nor has the president done any pushback at all, at least not publicly, over GOP-led obstruction when it happens. And, really...well, I can't say I don't blame them, because I do, but I still strongly suspect that a large percentage of the low-level obstruction would disappear if Obama seemed to care about it at all. I expect Republicans to place a high priority on stopping strongly ideological DC Circuit nominations. But district court picks? I doubt they really care much, but since there's no particular reason not to slow everything down, they might as well. And don't forget -- the president can have some leverage here, because local lawyers really don't like court delays.</div><div><br /></div><div>At any rate: we're still right around 60 seats with no nominee, but fewer than 25 nominees waiting for Senate action, with <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/executive_calendar/xcalv.pdf">fewer than 10</a> having been reporting out of committee and waiting floor action. Whoever is at fault, it's pretty clear that the biggest bottleneck now is at the nomination stage, not confirmation.</div>

No, Campaign Money Isn't the Root of All Evil<----->The Brennan Center's Jonathan Backer <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/blog/why-big-money-still-won-2012">gets upset</a> with Ezra Klein's recent (excellent) post in which he concluded that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/06/we-got-way-too-excited-over-money-in-the-2012-elections/">money in the 2012 elections turned out to be rather less of a threat to democracy</a> than many had feared in the post-Citizens United world. Backer's point: well, maybe Super PACs didn't change the election results, but surely they changed the politicians who received all that money.<br /><br />I doubt it. And Backer's examples certainly don't convince me.<br /><br />First example?<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The National Rifle Association spent nearly $20 million in the 2012 election on outside spending, making it the 15th largest independent spender. Is it any wonder senators facing tough re-election contests in 2014, such as Mark Begich (D-Alaska), Mark Pryor (D-Ark.), and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), voted against universal background checks for gun purchases despite near-consensus support among the public?</blockquote>C'mon. Does anyone, really, believe that it's campaign finance, rather than fear (justified or not) of voters' reaction to the policy position, which drove the votes of these Senators? Yes, yes, background checks polls really well -- but gun control doesn't in the states of those Senators who voted against it. Those Senators are almost certainly driven by the campaign messages that would be used if they voted the other way, not the incremental change in how much campaign money they and their opponents would have. Surely it's not as if gun control used to pass easily before Citizens United opened the floodgates.<br /><br />Second example? Even weaker:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">And while the threat of a double-dip recession couldnt persuade Congress to avert the self-imposed sequester, the typically languid House and Senate did manage in a mere six days to grant the Federal Aviation Administration more flexibility in managing the cuts  the only exception of its kind. While 800,000 workers experience cuts to unemployment benefits and 140,000 fewer families receive low-income housing vouchers, those people dont exert enough power and influence to extract concessions from Congress. Would these people have more clout if they had the means to make large campaign contributions?</blockquote>Where to begin...well, first of all, there is no Super PAC for air travelers. So the assertion that it's campaign finance that makes elected officials especially responsive to them appears to be an enormous stretch. Why might politicians care more about airport delays than low-income housing? Well, first of all, a lot more people fly than receive government housing assistance. Second, the middle class and wealthy people who fly are more likely to vote than poor people are. Third: politicians themselves spend tons of time in airports, but no Member of Congress qualifies for low-income housing help. Fourth: Members of Congress, successful professionals all, tend to have social networks largely composed of those middle-class and wealthy people crowding the airports.<br /><br />Would any of that change if campaigns were financed differently? Nope. It's worth recalling that the two presidents elected during the era of almost pure (general election) public financing, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, were no different than presidents elected before or after them on these sorts of issues.<br /><br />Stepping back from these particular examples...the main effect, in my view, of the hunt for campaign money &nbsp;is that on the time of the candidates; we've read the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-08/small-donors-may-make-politics-even-worse.html">horror stories</a> of how much time Members of Congress are expected to spend raising money, and that is a real scandal. My reading of the research (and I'll admit I'm not fully up to date), however, is that it's very difficult to connect campaign donations to particular acts that legislators make. That's especially true for high-profile issues such as guns. If campaign donations change policy positions of politicians, it's most likely to happen on obscure, little-reported (but still perhaps important) measures, especially ones that no one in their district has direct interest in.<br /><br />As it happens, I'm in favor of partial public financing of House and Senate elections (floors, not ceilings!). But not because I think that it would magically change the interests represented in Congress.* The truth is that there are lots and lots of reasons why politicians pay more attention to wealthy and middle class constituents than to poor ones, and it's not clear that campaign finance is on the list of reasons at all, let alone at the top.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />*Why then? In order to encourage at least minimally competitive elections in far more seats. Far too many House and even Senate elections fail to attract quality candidates from both major parties; I think partial public financing would stand a very good chance of improving that situation.

May 8, 1973<----->A busy day for Nixon, with several Watergate-related briefings with his new staff. Unlike his conversations with Haldeman and Ehrlichman, Nixon is here the only one who really knows anything -- and the version of events he tells is consistent with the new cover-up of the cover-up, not with the truth.<br /><br /><a name="more"></a><br />Nixon prepares Ron Ziegler for his press briefing on the Plumbers:<br /><br />--<br /><br />President Nixon: [...] [D]on't you think we had better check with Ehrlichman to say, to say that our position here is that I did not learn of this -- I mean, I did not learn of the [Fielding] burglary -- you know what I mean -- until I began my own investigation? ... Yeah, that he informed me of the burglary.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />President Nixon ... [I] talking to Bob, ... I might say I had no knowledge of the break-in, I had no --<br /><br />Ziegler: The Ellsberg?<br /><br />President Nixon: Exactly, the break-in, until my own investigation in March.[...] John [Dean?] and Ehrlichman didn't come in and tell me. Believe me. Nobody told me.<br /><br />--<br /><br />In fact, according to Ehrlichman, Nixon knew everything that Ehrlichman knew after a walk on the beach on July 8, 1972; it's also possible that Colson had already discussed it with Nixon. Nixon certainly knew before Watergate that Hunt was involved with the Plumbers and that the Plumbers were up to things which could never be disclosed. It makes little sense that he would have cared so much about covering up what they did if he didn't know what it was.<br /><br />In the continuing conversation with Ziegler, Nixon (falsely) denies meeting with Dean on September 15, and insists "we all assumed he was conducting an investigation." Indeed, Nixon well knows, and has always known, that there was never an investigation; that was invented for the press.<br /><br />Nixon then meets with Al Haig, four days into his new job as Chief of Staff. Haig quickly refers to Dean as a "son of a bitch," a "sniveling coward," and a "vicious little coward." They discuss the upcoming naming a special counsel:<br /><br />--<br /><br />President Nixon: Has Richardson gotten any word of special counsel yet?<br /><br />Haig: No, he hasn't.[...]<br />[...]<br />President Nixon: [...] If he had any -- wants anything, he can run names by or thoughts --<br /><br />Haig: Well, he knows quietly that he's to appoint no one without checking.<br /><br />President Nixon: Well, I'd just like to know something about it.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Later that afternoon, Nixon and Haig talk, according to Kutler for the first time, about the March 21 meeting with Dean. His version is, not surprisingly, quite different from what the actual tape shows.<br /><br />--<br /><br />President Nixon: [...] March 21st was the critical day. He came into the office and on that day did reveal a hell of a lot of things except leaving out that he was involved. Like he didn't go into the fact that he had fixed this. I told you the testimony for Magruder. Now that later comes up, that he did coach Magruder, which he was not supposed to have done. [...]<br /><br />...And -- and this is the critical point -- that this fellow Bittman, Hunt's lawyer, was now demanding more money for his attorney's fees.<br /><br />It was then that I got into a discussion which I deliberately led him on, about I said, well, suppose you could get it. How much -- how much you going to need. You're going to have to do it for four years, aren't you? So, that would cost a million dollars, but how are you going to get it delivered to him? And how -- you can't provide -- you can't produce -- clemency...<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />It was his job to tell me what the hell was up. And it was then -- it actually then in my own mind, as I reflect back, that triggered my own investigation of this Goddamn case is because, as I told you then, the word -- the only word you could (unintelligible) basically is blackmail.<br />[...]<br />Now, how would you answer anything like that? I don't know. I don't know. I can't do it. I can't get up and say, look, I'm not a crook, something like that...Here's the guy who for nine months we were counting upon, who was supposed to be making the reports. Here's the guy, and so forth an so on. And then he comes in for the first time nine months later reports this sort of thing --<br /><br />Haig: ...An investigation was launched and the man was told to write up a complete report. That was the kind of activity that he had been involved in, and that's it. It's got to be.<br /><br />--<br /><br />That evening, another meeting with Haig sets in place Nixon's defense lawyer:<br /><br />--<br /><br />Haig: ...We'll work out the way. That's why we'll get this thing through, get a, beef up our capability with a real tough guy who operates and works --<br /><br />President Nixon: I think [lawyer Fred] Buzhardt would be good. Get him over into it right away...[...] Now, with Buzhardt, you've got a guy that you know that is loyal and everything. I'd rather take a loyal guy and put him to work on this.<br /><br />Haig: And a smart guy.<br /><br />President Nixon: And a smart guy and a loyal guy and somebody that is not from the outside that we could really have the inside.<br /><br />--<br /><br />There's plenty more. Nixon is focused on Dean, all day -- at times worrying about what documents Dean might have, at one point shouting to Haig about how Dean let them down.
Catch of the Day<-----><div class="tr_bq">Okay, it's just as much trivia as CotD, but Reid Wilson deserves something for noticing one thing -- really <a href="https://twitter.com/HotlineReid/status/332153614896361473">two</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/HotlineReid/status/332153739148419072">things</a> -- about the newly elected Mark Sanford:</div><blockquote>Mark Sanford will join 10 other members of the class of 1994 in Congress when he's sworn in<br /><br />Weirdly, Sanford will be the 3rd member of the class of '94 to return this Congress after taking time off (Stockman and Salmon, too)&nbsp;</blockquote>I've written about <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2010/05/newts-babies-vs-watergate-babies.html">Newt babies vs. Watergate babies</a> before (and also sparked by a Reid Wilson item; I guess we share an interest). I don't think this late-in-the-day revival for the '94ers will really do much to change the overall verdict, which is that it's not a class that has much to be proud of.<br /><br />I'll finish by stealing my conclusion from the last time I wrote about the class of 1995, as I called it:<br /><br />Of course, any similarity of the class of 1995 and Newt Gingrich in wild but unfocused ambition, lack of interest in the substance of governing, and/or scandal in private life is surely a coincidence.
No, the Creation of the 60 Vote Senate Isn't Harry Reid's Fault<----->I really dislike <a href="http://mischiefsoffaction.blogspot.com/2013/05/snowe-middle-ground.html">this Republican talking point</a>, repeated by former Republican Senator Olympia Snowe at an appearance at the University of Denver:<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><ul><li>The majority has increasingly "filled up the amendment tree," making it harder for minority members to have any influence on legislation.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Minority members increasingly respond to this by filibustering.</li></ul></blockquote><div>It's probably a nice thing for Snowe to believe; it makes her choice to go along with "filibuster everything" seem like a reaction to Democratic overreach rather than going along with a radical, norm-destroying group of Republicans.</div><div><br /></div><div>But it's just plain wrong.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm pretty sure it's completely wrong for legislation: filibusters came first, and then filling the tree. I do recall that Mitch McConnell's immediate reaction to the 2008 election was to remind everyone that it took 60 votes to do anything in the Senate -- not that he would reluctantly be forced to make use of filibusters if his conference wasn't allowed to offer amendments, but just that it took 60 to do anything, as if that had always been the case. Nor do I recall any Republican offers to drop routine filibusters if only their amendments were allowed. Nor have Republicans only filibustered on those bills -- not even close to all of them -- in which amendments were offered.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>At any rate: as I've said before, and I'll say again when this gets trotted out: we have a perfectly good test on this claim, because if it was true that filibusters were only a reaction to "filling the tree" then it would be happening on legislation only. Nominations do not have amendments! And yet almost every nomination, beginning in January 2009, has been subjected to that same 60 vote requirement -- something entirely new at that point.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm on the side of the Republicans with respect to amendments -- I would very much like to get back to the kind of open amendments situation the Senate has traditionally protected.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>It just has nothing to do with the Republican choice of establishing the 60 vote requirement for almost everything.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><br />
Read Stuff, You Should<----->Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/earth-wind-amp-fire-mn0000135273">Philip Bailey</a>, 62. <br /><br />Fortunately, there's good stuff:<br /><br />1. With the caveat that I haven't read it, I suspect this new paper, "<a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w19014">Preventing Youth Violence and Dropout: A Randomized Field Experiment</a>," is something people should know about. Sara Heller, Harold Pollack, Roseanna Ander, Jens Ludwig.<br /><br />2. Ezra Klein on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/07/how-we-broke-the-senate-without-breaking-any-rules/">the Senate</a>.<br /><br />3.

May 7, 1973<----->It's a new week, and the new White House is getting organized, with Nixon agreeing on Al Haig as his new chief of staff.<br /><br /><a name="more"></a><br /><br />Elliot Richardson is preparing for his confirmation hearings for Attorney General, scheduled to begin in a couple of days, and today he announces that <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F30E15F93954137A93CAA9178ED85F478785F9">he would appoint a special counsel to handle Watergate</a>.<br /><br />At some point in early May, John Dean -- having failed to get what he wanted from the Justice Department -- started working another angle. He approached Senator Lowell Weicker, maverick Republican from Connecticut, and secretly told him what Dean was prepared to say. Before long, Watergate Committee counsel Sam Dash was meeting with Dean and his lawyer. Eventually, the Committee agreed to give Dean use immunity, meaning that prosecutors would have to complete their case against him before he testified. It's not what Dean wanted, but it was better than Justice was offering.<br /><br />A nice <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20913F6355F107A93C5A9178ED85F478785F9">New York Times explainer</a> this morning makes clear what the public knew at this point. The president's new cover story is intact, but the threat is beginning, from a familiar source.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Q. Was President Nixon himself involved in either part of the Watergate plot?<br /><br />A. There is no charge and no evidence, direct or hearsay, that the President understood the broad reach of the Watergate conspiracy before last March 21. At his news conference on April 17, Mr. Nixon said that on March 21 he heard "serious charges" and began his own new inquiry into the case.<br /><br />Q. Has not John W. Dean 3rd, the former White House counsel, said he could implicate the President in the cover-up?<br /><br />A. The issue of Newsweek out tomorrow relates two incidents that Mr. Dean is said to believe "associate" the President with the conspiracy, but both stories rest on Mr. Dean's assumptions, not the President's words...<br /><br />--<br /><br />The two charges are that Nixon thanked Dean for his work on the case on September 15, 1972, when the indictments were handed down; the Times points out that Dean could have been thanking Dean for (apparently) accurately reporting that the White House was not involved. The more serious charge is that Nixon knew about offers of clemency to Howard Hunt, but the charge, in the Newsweek article, is pretty vague, according to the Times.
The Perfect Benghazi Article<----->Some of you might be thinking: I'm sure that there's not much to all the conservative fuss about Benghazi, but I'm open to the possibility of some Obama Administration malfeasance...I wish there was some way for me to catch up on what Benghazi is really supposed to be about without having to dive into the crazy.<div><br /></div><div>Well, if that's you, then there's a Politico article now just for you. It's from yesterday afternoon, and titled "<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/05/huckabee-benghazi-will-drive-obama-from-office-90964.html">Huckabee: Benghazi will drive Obama from office</a>."</div><div><br /></div><div>It seems that, the Huck says, "as the information and facts begin to come out, it will become so obvious that there was a concerted and very, very deliberate attempt to mislead this country." Also? "[W]hen the facts come out, they will not be able to stand." Indeed, "this goes all the way to the heart of the integrity of the United States government." You think that's scary? Well, "as the facts come out, I think were going to see something startling." After all, "When a president lies to the American people and is part of a cover-up, he cannot continue to govern." Don't forget, "as bad as Watergate was, because it broke the trust between the president and the people, no one died. This is more serious because four Americans did in fact die.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm really not leaving anything out; that's what the Huck has to say, or at least that's what's reported in this Politico piece. There's a cover-up, and the facts will come out, and there you go. What's being covered up? Not even a hint. What facts will emerge? No suggestions at all. Apparently it's from his radio show on Monday...maybe he went into extensive detail that Politico didn't think was relevant to the case for why Barack Obama would be driven from office. Maybe he didn't. My sense? It doesn't matter!&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>You know, there's some historical precedent for all of this. Tip O'Neill, soon after becoming House Majority Leader, started <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2012/12/december-8-1972.html">getting the House ready for impeachment proceedings</a>, well before the avalanche of revelations on Watergate began. Not because he knew or even suspected exactly what would show up when investigations continued, but because he believed that Richard Nixon's White House was up to so many things that if it unraveled impeachment would be the solution. I think that's basically what's happening here, and presumably what happened with Bill Clinton, too: Republicans are just certain that there's a ton of illegal, unethical, and politically toxic material that would be unearthed if only they could put a special prosecutor on the job.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Now, O'Neill thought that because he listened carefully to what people were talking about. My guess is that Huckabee et al. are listening carefully...to each other, and working themselves over nothing. Or maybe the Huck doesn't believe any of it, but just cares about the ratings for his radio show. At any rate, and pending something new, this Politico piece really is everything you need to know about Benghazi.</div>
Liberal Hack Economists Remain MIA (ACA Edition)<----->To return to an oldie but goody: it's still striking to me that no one has jumped up to fill what appears to be a market opening for hack economists on the liberal side. This comes to mind this time from the reaction of economists, including liberal economists, to the sudden decrease in health care inflation over the last few years. As <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/business/slowdown-in-rise-of-health-care-costs-may-persist.html">Annie Lowrey reports</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Major new studies from researchers at Harvard University, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and elsewhere have concurred that at least some of the slowdown is unrelated to the recession, and might persist as the economy recovers.&nbsp;</blockquote>Not, that is, "Obamacare is slashing health care inflation!" Lowrey does have some relatively optimistic quotes from David Cutler, health care economist, but they're still very tempered.<br /><br />What we don't have, and haven't anywhere that I've seen it, are liberal economists claiming that the entire slowdown in costs has been ACA-related, or even the bulk of it (the bulk is in fact, economists tell us, recession-related, and of the rest it's not altogether clear where it came from).<br /><br />Just as we didn't see any liberal economists last year arguing that the economy was in fact way more healthy than people thought. If anything, in the lead-up to an election with a Democrat in the White House, most prominent liberal economists stressed the weaknesses of the economy.<br /><br />There are plenty of liberal hack pundits; there's nothing about being a liberal that prevents people from embracing convenient arguments, even if they're barely plausible. And there are conservative hack economists, so there's nothing about being an economist that prevents lame spin. But for whatever reason, there aren't any liberal economists who function as party apologists. That doesn't mean that liberal economists are always right about everything; it also doesn't mean that there's no biases involved in their work (more, perhaps, in choice of projects, for example). It just means that, as far as I can see, they tend strongly to call them as they see them, rather than adapting their analysis and talking points to whatever the Democratic Party happens to need at the time.<br /><br />And I'm not saying that there should be liberal hack economists. I don't think liberals are worse off because of this gap, at all. I just think it's odd that either there's no demand for it, or there's no one willing to fill the demand.

Things Never Ever Ever Ever To Debate<----->Thomas Roberts <a href="https://twitter.com/ThomasARoberts/status/331512764596105216">tweets</a>: "From Monday's show -- Is Obama a lame duck?" Apparently in an effort to scare off anyone who might otherwise be tempted to watch his MSNBC show.<br /><br />Just cut it out, everyone, right now. It's not an interesting question. It's not a question that's worth debating. It's not a question that's going to shed any light on anything that we really want to know.<br /><br />It is useful, in my view, to speculate or to analyze a president's current reputation with people in Washington, and to assess how that might affect a battle in Congress or in the bureaucracy. Sure. Regular readers know that I still believe that Neustadt was correct about that. I'll pay a bit of attention, too, to the polling about Obama's popularity, even thought he won't be on a future ballot, because I suspect that Washingtonians (to use Neustadt's fine technical word for people who have to deal with the president) pay attention to it.<br /><br />But boiling it all down to whether or not a president is a lame duck? A waste of everyone's time.
It's Still About the Broken GOP<----->I have to commend Ezra Klein for push, push, pushing everyone to understand the place of the presidency in the US political system. As he says, that system "is centered around Congress rather than the White House," and he's been doing terrific and incredibly valuable work explaining to people what this means in terms of the limits of what presidents can do. I do hope everyone reads his <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/03/politics-is-not-here-to-please-you/">latest essay on the topic</a>, from his Wonkblog on Friday.<br /><br />That said, I continue to dissent from what Klein, <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2243798">Rick Hasen</a>, and others say about polarization. Oh, there's no question about the levels of partisan polarization: we all agree about that. The key points are well documented; it's been the case for over a decade that the most liberal Republicans in the House and in the Senate are more conservative than the most conservative Democrats. Or at least that's how they vote in Congress, which is basically the same thing. And I think there's general consensus that polarization is probably pretty stable at these levels. Other than the emergence of some new and so far unexpected new ue area of public policy which cuts in a totally different way than current issues, there's really no reason to expect significant change.<br /><br />The question -- and Hasen goes over this pretty thoroughly in his paper -- is whether institutional change is needed for the political system to function with partisan polarization.<br /><br />And I continue to believe that there's nothing inherent in partisan polarization that makes Madisonian politics -- separated institutions sharing powers -- a problem.<br /><br />It's true that Madisonian institutions often yield gridlock; in my view, the strongest critique of the US system is that it is biased in favor of the status quo. Gridlock -- situations in which issues lie unresolved for extended periods, often despite majority public opinion appearing to favor one side of the argument, or perhaps despite the availability of what appears (to the critic) to be obvious "common sense" compromises -- is frustrating. But gridlock doesn't depend on polarization. Current gridlock, I'd say, is nowhere near the problem of the gridlock of the era of the conservative coalition, and especially the period from 1959 through the Kennedy presidency, when liberals held large majorities in Congress and eventually the presidency but often couldn't manage to get legislation out of committees in the pre-reformed Congress. Which certainly doesn't mean reform isn't needed now (after all, reform is part of what ended that era of gridlock), but does remind us that gridlock is a normal part of the system.<br /><br />All that said: I agree with Hasen and Klein that we have a good deal of dysfunctional gridlock in the present system. Dysfunctional gridlock -- the kind that not only delays "common sense" solutions but also does things like leaving executive branch and judicial positions vacant, threatening to default the government of the United States, and (perhaps) encourages and then allows a party which loses an election to attempt to undermine the economy in order to secure future electoral advantage. The question is whether that sort of dysfunctional gridlock is partisan polarization or not. They both believe that it is; Klein believes that institutional reform is the solution, while Hasen believes that moderate reforms will be ineffective and that it still premature to talk radical Constitutional reform, especially since effecting radical reform is unlikely anyway.<br /><br />Where I differ with them is that I do not believe that partisan polarization makes dysfunctional gridlock likely. It's not partisan polarization that's the problem; it's the<a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/04/06/the_republican_party_is_officially_broken/"> broken, radical Republican Party</a>. Essentially, party polarization isn't nearly as important as the array of problems within the GOP -- antagonism to compromise as an organizing principle; a closed information loop dominated by the Republican-aligned press; a conservative marketplace which blunts the electoral incentive for much of the party; and loss of interest in and capacity for public policy. Without those internal dysfunctions, even an extremely conservative Republican Party would be able to cut deals and allow the political system to function relatively smoothly even with divided government; with those internal dysfunctions, the current system works poorly but any other system would be equally disastrous or worse.<br /><br />Again, I think that's easiest to see on budget questions. The basic budget question, after all, is basically just about reaching a compromise between two numbers. That shouldn't be difficult, and partisan polarization should actually make it easier, because it allows centralized negotiations. And yet Republicans during this and the previous Congress are stymied because, among many of their constituents, compromise -- even on Republican terms -- means that Republicans have lost, since compromise itself is seen as a disaster.<br /><br />In my view, then, the real question isn't so much how to change the system to accommodate partisan polarization; the system can handle polarization between two healthy political parties just fine (other than that status quo bias and perhaps other traditionally discussed problems). Instead, what's really needed is some thought about what it would take to cure what's broken with the GOP.<br /><br />Now, some will argue that it's a problem that's self-correcting: a broken party will lose elections, and we do know that ideologically extreme parties tend to moderate after extended electoral loss. I worry, however, that the current GOP isn't normal enough to follow that pattern. I worry about the conservative marketplace and the downgrading of the electoral incentive. I worry about the information loop, and the inability of even those Republicans who want to win elections to correctly diagnose what it takes to do so. I worry that those who do stay in touch with reality tend to be exiled from the party. And I worry that the electoral incentive for moderation simply isn't great enough to overcome all of that.<br /><br />Mostly, however, I worry that it's not really just a question of ideological positioning. If Republicans really believe that compromise is evil, then it doesn't really matter whether the ideological gap between their position and the Democratic position is narrow or wide.<br /><br />Let me put it another way. If I'm correct that the Republican Party is really broken, then "fixing" the system to allow electoral winners to get their way easily is extremely dangerous because sooner or later that broken Republican Party will win but be incapable of governing well. That's a recipe for disaster. Remember, in parliamentary systems, winning parties don't simply impose the most extreme version of their platform; there are usually important institutional constraints (such as a strong bureaucracy, for example) that moderate change. But a reformed US system might not have those constraints -- and if those constraints are system norms, the current Republican Party might simply trample over them.<br /><br />If, however, the GOP can be "fixed," then the traditional reasons for opposing strict majority party rule still apply, even at the cost of some gridlock. It's still the case that democracy should be rule of the people, not just rule of majorities; it's still the case that those who want voters to choose between two programs are asking for something that voting can't really do, and at any rate something that most voters don't seem particularly interested in.<br /><br />So it seems to me that the real questions here are about the Republican Party. Has it in fact become dysfunctional? If so, what can be done to restore its health? Will it be self-correcting, thanks to electoral incentives? Or do we need to devise new incentives, and if so, what?<br /><br />As for reforms to accommodate the current party system, it seems to me that the job of reformers is mostly about finding fixes for those institutions which have been trampled by the dysfunctional GOP, fixes which restore, in many cases, norms which worked fine but have been lost. So Senate reform should be about finding rules to restore what was good about the Senate before it became a 60-vote Senate.<br /><br />Obviously, none of that is going to happen if people are focused on fairy tales about magic presidents. So what Ezra Klein has been doing is extremely valuable. The next steps, however, are a lot trickier; political scientists really disagree about this stuff, probably because (unlike the question of whether a presidential speech can get Congress to act) it's not really something that can be determined through empirical research. Oh, I think that the questions I raise about the GOP are essentially empirical -- we could determine whether or not electoral incentives are driving them -- but not the questions of majority party rule. On that one, those of us who are with Ranney, with Madison, and with Arendt (at least as I read them) are swimming against the tide in the political culture. But if those thinkers are correct, then it would be a great tragedy indeed if the strengths of the US political system are abandoned.
Read Stuff, You Should<----->Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/they-might-be-giants-mn0000493327">John Flansburgh</a>, 53.<br /><br />Here's a little of the good stuff:<br /><br />1. I sort of think that I should leave that <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/05/what-we-know-oregon-medicaid-study">Oregon study</a> alone unless I'm willing to read it myself. Still, I'll link to Kevin Drum's latest try at what to make of the empirical findings.<br /><br />2. And since I complain a lot about the post-policy GOP, I also should link to Ross Douthat's distillation of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/opinion/sunday/douthat-what-health-insurance-doesnt-do.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">emerging conservative position on health care.</a><br /><br />3. And worth reading: John Harwood <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/q-a-with-david-axelrod/">interviews David Axelrod</a>.<br /><br /><br />
Sunday Question for Liberals<----->Yup, it's going to be about 2106, same as the question for conservatives. Interested in which 2016 possible candidates you find unacceptable, out of those who either are actively running now or at least getting frequent mentions. The list seems to be: Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Martin O'Malley, Andrew Cuomo, Kirsten Gillibrand, John Hickenlooper, Amy Klobuchar, Brian Schweitzer, Mark Warner, Elizabeth Warren, but feel free to add anyone else you don't like! So: which, if any, do you think are totally unacceptable?
Sunday Question for Conservatives<----->Yes, yes, yes, I know about it being too early for 2016 and all that, but nevertheless.<br /><br />We have a very long list of potential candidates already, many of whom are actively doing the things that they would need to do to run; in other words, they're running right now. So my question: of all these candidates, which would you find completely unacceptable?<br /><br />The list seems to include (and I'm trying to keep it fairly short, just the ones who seem at least semi-actively looking or have been frequently mentioned) Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, Jon Huntsman, Rand Paul, Rick Santorum, Marco Rubio, Bobby Jindal, John Kasich, Susana Martinez, Mike Pence, Rob Portman, Rick Perry, Paul Ryan, and Scott Walker. Which, if any, are on your unacceptable list?
Friday Baseball Post<----->I've been negligent about doing this, but I have to take note of the remarkable games last night (Posey 9th inning HR to win it despite a typically dominant Kershaw start) and tonight (Guillermo Quiroz 10th inning HR to win it)<br /><br />1. When's the last time the Giants won a game in which they allowed a 7-run inning? Just generally, I wonder how many games a year anyone wins despite allowing a seven run inning. <br /><br />2. Through these first two games of the series, the Giants have not yet retired the Dodgers cleanly 1-2-3 in any of the 19 innings. There were two 1-2-3 innings tonight thanks to a DP. And yet the Giants won both games -- and allowed only one run last night.<br /><br />3. Revenge! I'm pretty sure I attended this series in LA in 1974: <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/LAN/LAN197406210.shtml">first game</a> Dodgers scored three in the 8th to tie and then won it, 4-3, on a leadoff HR by Buckner off of Sosa in the 10th; <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/LAN/LAN197406220.shtml">second game </a>Jimmy Wynn homered in the 9th to tie it and then Ferguson lead off the 10th with a HR off Sosa to win it, 3-2; <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/LAN/LAN197406230.shtml">third game</a> the Dodgers got two in the 7th to tie and then Ken McMullen singled off Don McMahon to knock in Lopes and win it, 4-3. Well, put it this way: my memory is that I attended a series sweep in LA in which two of the games were walk-off HRs. If there was another one like this, I'm not sure I want to know about it. Granted, real revenge would have required being at the games tonight and last night, and who knows what will happen tomorrow, but I'll take it.<br /><br /><br />
What Mattered This Week?<----->Back to basics: the employment report. Nothing great, but no disaster. We're certainly not having anything like Clinton's peace-and-prosperity second term, but at least for the moment it seems we're more in the direction of getting there than we are moving towards George W. Bush's second term. Even if there doesn't seem much hope of actually getting there within four years.<br /><br />It's good that Obama finally got around to choosing a Secretary of Commerce, but much harder to imagine how a Secretary of Commerce can matter.<br /><br />What do you have? What do you think mattered this week?
Greedy Bastards and Democracy<----->Teaching a class about American politics, Congress, interest groups, or some related topics? You really should find room for <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/25/online-sales-tax-senate_n_3153669.html">this comment</a>, from a Ryan Grim and John Celock article about the online sales tax fight:<br /><blockquote>As one moderate Democratic senator put it during the swipe fee fight, "I'm surprised at how much of our time is spent trying to divide up the spoils between various economic interests. I had no idea. I thought wed be focused on civil liberties, on education policy, energy policy and so on."<br /><br />"The fights down here can be put in two or three categories: The big greedy bastards against the big greedy bastards; the big greedy bastards against the little greedy bastards; and some cases even the other little greedy bastards against the other little greedy bastards," the senator said, requesting anonymity so as not to alienate any of the bastards, regardless of size.</blockquote>Yup. It is possible to take this point of view too far; it's not true that all US politics is simply interest group fights in which ideas of principle, ideology, or general public good are mostly or even entirely irrelevant. But there's a lot more of it than you would think from press coverage of Congress, the presidency, and elections. These fights are not, generally, along the lines of business vs. labor, or business vs. consumer, or business vs. the environment. There's no "good guys" or "bad guys" (whoever you think good and bad buys are). There's just greedy bastards -- although one of the ways they fight is to try to make people think there are good guys vs. bad guys, and the political culture encourages them to do so.<br /><br />Quick note: I don't think that's a bad thing! One of the ways of thinking about politics is that it's about who gets what. Nothing wrong with that; politics in a democracy is a better way of settling those kinds of questions than brute force, direct payoffs, or some of the other ways they can be settled. And I think it's also fine that we encourage the participants to pretend that the common good matters even when it's really just a fight between greedy bastards; it's a positive incentive for better behavior.<br /><br />But going back to the main point about how common this is: If you don't understand that, there's a big part of US politics that you're missing.

May 2, 1973<----->At this point, the morning newspapers are just full of revelations and accusations; the Times today has stories <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00A17F93E54137A93C0A9178ED85F478785F9">about the Ellsberg trial</a>, where it's been revealed that Ehrlichman met with Judge Byrne in April to offer him a job, and about the <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10F15F93E54137A93C0A9178ED85F478785F9">details of the Fielding break-in</a>.&nbsp;I love this one: on the plane to California, Liddy and Hunt were traveling under assumed names, presumably to cover their tracks. A flight attendant from that plane now says that she had talked to Hunt, who later sent her a book (presumably one of his? the story doesn't say) -- signing the accompanying note with his alias. On White House stationery.<br /><br /><a name="more"></a><br />By now, many of the basic facts of the Watergate operation, other Nixon campaign operations, and the plumbers have become public, although many in garbled for, exaggerated, or with important pieces left out.<br /><br />The <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0910F93E54137A93C0A9178ED85F478785F9">big story in the Times, by Seymour Hersh, reports on the cover-up</a> -- it's a good indication of where they were at this point. Hirsch has the cover-up organized by Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Mitchell, and also names Magruder, LaRue, and Dean as key players.<br /><br />--<br /><br />The cover-up was formulated during some secret meetings held at the re-election headquarters here [Washington] in late June, according to investigators.<br /><br />The basic scheme was said to have called for all of those involved in the operation to deny any knowledge of it, and for the re-election committee to issue statements to that effect. In essence, investigators said, everyone involved in the operation repeatedly lied to federal investigators, prosecutors, other White House officials, and finally, to President Nixon<br /><br />--<br /><br />So close!<br /><br />In the White House, Nixon met with John Ehrlichman for the last time. Nixon, in Ehrlichman's version (via Ambrose), is acting suspicious, leading Ehrlichman to believe the conversation might be being taped. Nixon says, for example: "In March I learned some things [such as the Fielding break-in]. I acted instantly. I said to Kleindienst and Petersen: 'By all means, get it to the prosecutor or Dean will hold it over your head.' As soon as it came to my attention -- that's the important point -- it was relayed to California."<br /><br />Ehrlichman knows that's not true, and challenges him, but Nixon changes the subject. Ehrlichman then pleads to Nixon that former plumber Egil Krogh, who now is in the Department of Transportation but will soon have to resign, should not go to jail for the Fielding break-in, and Nixon, in Ehrlichman's telling, agrees to a pardon.<br /><br />Then it's Haldeman's turn, in his last Oval Office meeting with Nixon. Haldeman now tells the president that his new Chief of Staff should be Alexander Haig, Kissinger's old assistant. Nixon agrees. And so Al Haig now enters the picture.
Eric Cantor's Dilemma?<----->Ross Douthat is a fan of the ill-fated House health care initiative last week, which was torpedoed by a faction who decided that voting for a program to carry out a GOP talking point would, in this instance, count as supporting Obamacare. Douthat had previously bashed Republican politicians for not fighting for the policy ideas that some conservative wonks support, but now decides that <a href="http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/01/eric-cantors-dilemma/">Cantor deserves credit for trying</a> -- because, Douthat believes, in his position he couldn't do more:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Because the Republicans are a minority in the Senate, because senators represent broader constituencies than congressmen, and because the structure of the upper chamber is designed to make compromise a necessity in any case, theres a lot more room for Paul to be entrepreneurial on foreign policy (or for David Vitter to be entrepreneurial on banking reform, or for Marco Rubio to entrepreneurial  even if I think its in a mistaken cause  on immigration) than there is for a House leader charged with managing a fractious caucus to do the same.</blockquote>Yes, but. The problem here isn't so much House vs. Senate, or even leadership vs. rank-and-file (although that is a real consideration), but an absolute, self-imposed bright line against working with Democrats. Douthat says, correctly, that "the House runs on partisanship." And yet: it doesn't have to, at least not always. The mechanisms that allow the majority party to get its way whenever it is united are very real and important, but they do not, in fact, preclude cross-party majorities from potentially succeeding.<br /><br />In fact, Douthat gives away the game: "obviously House Democrats arent about to go along with a measure designed as part of a larger strategy to pick apart Obamacare." Well, yes. If, however, Republicans were trying to improve health care...that's something that House Democrats, Senate Democrats, and Barack Obama might well go along with. So it's not being in the House that's the problem, and that's forcing Cantor to win almost every single Republican vote; it's that we're talking here about an explicitly partisan strategy, with the only question about whether Cantor's tactics are better than those of other House Republicans.<br /><br />That's not what Paul is up to on foreign policy, or Vitter on banking, or Rubio on immigration. They're trying to get something substantive done (or, at least, get a reputation for trying to get something substantive done), and none of them are, apparently, terrified of being pictured with a Democrat. And, presto, they can find Democrats willing to work with them.<br /><br />It's probably true that Eric Cantor can't follow that course if he also wants to be Speaker some day. But that's not inherent in the House, and it's even possible that Cantor (and Boehner, and other House leaders) might try to persuade the rank-and-file that there are real policy gains available through some sort of bipartisanship. Unfortunately, there's little sign that either Cantor or the House Republican conference in general are very interested in real policy gains. And that, and not anything else about the House, is why Cantor doesn't actually deserve much "credit for the effort."
Why Democrats Lost the FAA Fight, and What They Should Do Next Time<----->I have a new column out over at TAP <a href="http://prospect.org/article/bad-flight-plan">on the FAA fight</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Heres what Democrats should have done, and should be ready to do next time that a Republicans object to a specific program cut...Democrats should collect all of their sequestration complaints: Head Start, Meals on Wheels, and on and on. Next time Republicans squawk about a terrible spending cut (maybe to defense contracts?), Senate Democrats should immediately rush a bill to the floor to satisfy the Republican complaint along with a similar-sized Democratic objection. And they should satisfy those complaints, but not by giving agencies flexibility to take money away from some other, unspecified, program. No, they should flat-out cancel the cuts. </blockquote>Lots more over there explaining why that's the right strategy, and why Democrats were bound to lose with the strategy they were following.<br /><br />Would it work? I think there's a fairly good chance that it would. Asking Republicans to move on taxes is asking them to go back on, really, their number one campaign promise. Asking them to let the deficit get a bit bigger...well, I don't think they really care, and I don't think most GOP-aligned groups really care. <br /><br />The fallback position, which I didn't get into over in the column, should be for Democrats to demand that if Republicans want some sequestration cut restored then it should be Republicans who supply a specific corresponding program cut. Not agency flexibility. But again, that should be paired with a Democratic priority, even if it is paid for.<br /><br />The best solution, however, is to just restore funding without pay-fors. As far as I can see, for Democrats that's both the best politics and the best policy.
Read Stuff, You Should<----->Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0679539/">Jo Ann Pflug</a>, 73.<br /><br />To the good stuff:<br /><br />1. Aaron Carroll and Austin Frakt go in depth on <a href="http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/oregon-and-medicaid-and-evidence-and-chill-people/">yesterday's Oregon Medicaid study</a>. I screwed this up in the Roundup at Greg's place last night, and I shouldn't have. The initial spin was that the study showed no health benefits (while also showing substantial financial benefits) from Medicaid, but that's an incorrect reading. It does show some benefits, but mainly the evidence is inconclusive -- and it's not clear, Carroll and Frakt explain, that the study was able to actually reach conclusions on health outcomes. And at any rate, what evidence there is points in the right direction (that is, in the direction of Medicaid helping people stay healthy), but is not statistically significant -- which is hardly the same thing as a claim of "no effect." Anyway, if you want to know more, click through; Carroll and Frakt walk everyone through it.<br /><br />(I don't, and can't, read every study for which I link to a blog post or news article which summarizes it. But I need to do better than I did on this one).<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Dan Drezner, still <a href="http://drezner.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/05/01/why_political_scientists_are_screwed_redux">a pessimist about political science and Congress</a>.<br /><br />3. And speaking of that first one: advice from Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers, for non-experts, on how to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-01/six-ways-to-separate-lies-from-statistics.html">know what to make of quantitative research.</a>
May 1, 1973<----->Two pieces of news on this day, the day after Nixon finally let his top two staff members and his Attorney General go and fired John Dean.<br /><br />The Senate unanimously adopted a resolution, sponsored by liberal Republican Charles Percy calling for a special prosecutor.<br /><br /><a name="more"></a><br />And Nixon was shocked to find the FBI had sealed off the offices of Bob Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, at the orders of new White House Counsel Leonard Garment. Haldeman, Ambrose tells us, had comes to his old office to start preparing for his appearances before the grand jury and the Senate Watergate Committee, but an FBI agent was there and told him he could go in but couldn't take anything out -- couldn't even bring his briefcase in with him. Nixon stopped by and apparently lost his temper and even shoved the agent.<br /><br />That evening, Nixon spoke to his new nominee for Attorney General, Elliot Richardson. Only Nixon's side of the phone conversation was taped, but the Kutler transcript is worth it:<br /><br />--<br /><br />President Nixon: What AI was going to say is that on this sense of the Senate thing it seems to me -- and I've been thinking about it myself is basically, appointing you, of course, can name an individual...in this area, with the authority to do what you want, of course, but what you might do is indicate your desire to discuss the matter with congressional leaders or to name the head of criminal division [Henry Petersen]. What's your thought about it? That's right. You can do -- what I mean is....you want to name somebody, that's your prerogative....You are basically a man who is responsible. You are the Attorney General. I do think that the selection of Petersen would make sense. You know what I mean? [...] ...I'm not trying to tell you how to do it, but let me say that you had absolute authority to do that. [...]<br /><br />--<br /><br />The idea of a special prosecutor went a long ways back, even to before the election. As Emery points out, at that point -- even in March, maybe in April -- Nixon could have selected his own, or at least the loyal Kleindienst would have selected someone. Now, however, all of it is slipping rapidly from Nixon's control.
Yes, Ted Cruz Could Win the Presidency<----->This morning's big story was Robert Costa's report that <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/347052/cruz-2016">Ted Cruz is actively running for president</a>. Well, no one says it that way, but it's how I think of it. In Josh Putnam's formulation, whether or not Cruz will be running <i>in</i>&nbsp;2016, he is currently running <i>for</i> 2016 by doing all the things that he has to do right now to be a viable candidate going forward.<br /><br />At any rate, the early prognostication is that his chances are somewhere between slim and none. <strike>Jonathan Chait</strike>&nbsp;Dan Amira*,&nbsp;<a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/05/ted-cruz-president-2016-goldwater-national-review.html">for example</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">What are Cruz's prospects for winning the GOP nomination in 2016, and then the presidency? They are <i>absolutely terrible</i>.</blockquote>Well, it's a two-part question. First, on the general election: yes, Cruz is likely to be perceived as an ideological outlier, but that's a penalty, not a disqualification -- it didn't, for example, prevent Ronald Reagan from winning. I'd guess that Cruz probably spots the Democrats two or three percentage points compared with someone with a more moderate image -- which matters, but is hardly the end of the story.<br /><br />As a candidate for the nomination, the basics are that Cruz would be a minimally viable candidate: he will have conventional qualifications, if slightly on the skimpy side, and is probably more or less within the ideological mainstream of his party -- most of his dissent within the party appears to be more about attitude than issues, and if immigration winds up being his big issue he may well be more inside the mainstream than his opponents.<br /><br />Will it matter that Republican Senators (reportedly) don't like him? It's not a plus -- Barack Obama, with similar conventional credentials, was surely helped within the party because Democratic Senate leaders vouched for him. On the other hand, Members of Congress are traditionally overrated within presidential politics. As for his general McCarthyite tactics, that's probably more of a plus than a minus among Republican activists, and perhaps even other Republican party actors.<br /><br />That doesn't mean, of course, that Cruz is likely to win; it's far too long from now to then to really have a good sense of it. He is, for now, just another candidate. And, as with all viable nomination candidates, he'll have strengths and weaknesses that are revealed through the long campaign. But as far as I can see (and assuming that he's actually eligible for the office), there's no obvious reason to believe that he has no chance.<br /><br />And pretty much anyone who could win a major party nomination has a reasonable chance of winning the presidency.<br /><br /><br />*My apologies for getting this wrong. Updated and corrected as indicated.
Watergate and Conspiracy Theories<----->For those who don't read the Watergate posts, I want to draw your attention to a <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/05/april-30-1973.html?showComment=1367407914887#c8156894801743525581">terrific comment from the April 30 edition</a>. I'm just going to make a post of it...this is all commenter Adam: I'll come back and add a bit more at the end:<div><br /></div><div>--<br /><div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One of the key things this retrospective has taught me is not just the limitations of Presidents, but the limitations of <i>conspiracies</i>. These posts should be required reading for anyone tempted to believe in a conspiracy theory.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Which isnt to say conspiracies dont happen. This is, after all, an actual criminal conspiracy at the highest levels of state power. But thats the thing... its not the moon landing, let alone 9/11 - all theyre scheming over is a few low-rent burglaries/buggings, and then a cover-up of those operations.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">But they seem to be terrible at it. Not only do they fail to pull it off and keep their connections to it secret, but as soon as the pressure rises, they all get lawyers and start squealing on each other. They cant remember what each other know, they probably cant remember what they themselves knew at which point...they just seem to be really ineffective.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">And these are not a bunch of chumps. Its a President and chief of staff known for being clever, extremely driven, and politically ruthless; and a very competent inner circle.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Theres also very little of the <i>style</i> of imagined conspiracies here. You have moments where Nixon says things like, You're to break into the place, rifle the files, and bring them in. But for the most part they do an elaborate dance around the issue at hand, rarely saying exactly what they mean - even those who dont know theyre being taped. They pretend to know less than they do, they nudge each other towards taking more of the rap, mostly they just fret aimlessly, for months on end. And when they need to lay down the law to someone, like Mitchell for instance, they dont seem to have the nerve to do it.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Or take something like the situation with Judge Sirica, as JB described it <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/february-3-1973.html">here</a>. When Nixon first airs his frustrations about Sirica to Colson, and asks if hes waiting for a Democrat to nominate him to the Supreme Court, Colson says:</span></div><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">No, no. He is a Republican. I know him pretty well. I have been with him at various events -- social events. Very decent guy, dedicated to you and to Eisenhower.</span></blockquote><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Now, in conspiracy land, what happens next is that they arrange for Colson to play a round of golf with him and just tell him, as a loyal soldier, what to do; or if he does balk, they promise him a SCOTUS seat, bribe him with millions, threaten or blackmail him or whatever - and problem solved. But no, in reality, they just speculate about whether hes doing it because hes a hot-headed Italian and carry on the dance of words. It seems its not even remotely on the radar to influence a judge. I mean, what kind of conspiracy is this!?</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">They also have a hard time raising the money to keep the boys quiet - again, this is a plot run by the White House and senior figures in the GOP, and they cant get their hands on enough money to keep their conspiracy secret. In the movies and on the net, hush-money is really not a problem for these kind of people.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Now, no doubt a good deal of this is the result of what JB has been explaining about Nixons alienation of the rest of government, and presidential weakness in general. I dare say its easier to pull off a conspiracy if youre Stalin than if youre occupying the White House. And I guess a circle of, say, shadowy international financiers, has less institutional barriers facing them. On the other hand, they lack many advantages of being officially in charge of the country. Like being able to offer immunity, or ask the FBI to destroy evidence.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Still, Id tentatively suggest that on this evidence, to pull off a major conspiracy like an inside-job 9/11 is, if not actually impossible, so incredibly unlikely to succeed that no experienced or competent pol would ever try it.</span></div></div></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">--</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div>Back to me: I think that's all exactly right.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>One other point, however, worth making is that the Nixon tapes themselves are excellent evidence against ongoing major conspiracy theories, stuff such as faked moon landings or UFO cover-ups, or larger political things such as domination of the government by shadowy outside actors. Basically, we have on tape much of what Richard Nixon said from February 1971 through July 1973, and there's no indication of any of those conspiracies in what we have to date. And yet Nixon was candid enough on these tapes that he was willing to incriminate himself multiple times. His Chief of Staff, too, was candid enough to incriminate himself. And others, who (supposedly?) didn't know about the tapes, were also quite candid about their Watergate-related crimes. And yet none of them happened to mention any of those other conspiracies. Nor, for that matter, do any of the White House tapes of other presidents, for whatever that's worth.</div><div><br /></div><div>So: maybe these far-reaching conspiracies were nevertheless unknown to the President of the United States and his top aides (depending on the conspiracy theory at issue, that might be absolutely implausible). Maybe, in all those hours, it just happened to never come up -- again, depending on the theory at issue, this might be very plausible or not plausible at all. Maybe Nixon and Haldeman knew that there were certain things that absolutely could not be exposed, but it was perfectly fine to expose their own criminal actions (seems highly improbable to me). Maybe everyone who has reviewed the tapes is in on it -- after all, there are all those things that are blacked out of transcripts for "national security" reasons -- but that's an awful large conspiracy, by now.</div><div><br /></div><div>Not that any of this will convince anyone who truly wants to believe in conspiracies; hey, maybe I'm in on it! But, yes, the evidence of Watergate -- and, in my view, Iran-Contra, as well -- makes it hard to believe that there are really lots of massive conspiracies that the government has managed to pull off without getting caught.</div>
Read Stuff, You Should<----->Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/joshuvo01.shtml">Von Joshua</a>, 65. What's not to like?

April 30, 1973<----->The resignations are released to the press earlier in the day, with Nixon then returning from Camp David late in the day and giving a prime time address. The key paragraphs, in which he again embraces the new cover story for the cover-up (<a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=3824&amp;st=&amp;st1=">full transcript here</a>; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=765wvJWdaHw">watch it here</a>):<br /><br /><a name="more"></a><br />--<br /><br /><br />Until March of this year, I remained convinced that the denials were true and that the charges of involvement by members of the White House Staff were false. The comments I made during this period, and the comments made by my Press Secretary in my behalf, were based on the information provided to us at the time we made those comments. However, new information then came to me which persuaded me that there was a real possibility that some of these charges were true, and suggesting further that there had been an effort to conceal the facts both from the public, from you, and from me.<br /><br />As a result, on March 21, I personally assumed the responsibility for coordinating intensive new inquiries into the matter, and I personally ordered those conducting the investigations to get all the facts and to report them directly to me, right here in this office.<br /><br />I again ordered that all persons in the Government or at the Re-Election Committee should cooperate fully with the FBI, the prosecutors, and the grand jury. I also ordered that anyone who refused to cooperate in telling the truth would be asked to resign from Government service. And, with ground rules adopted that would preserve the basic constitutional separation of powers between the Congress and the Presidency, I directed that members of the White House Staff should appear and testify voluntarily under oath before the Senate committee which was investigating Watergate.<br /><br />I was determined that we should get to the bottom of the matter, and that the truth should be fully brought out--no matter who was involved.<br /><br /><br />At the same time, I was determined not to take precipitate action and to avoid, if at all possible, any action that would appear to reflect on innocent people. I wanted to be fair. But I knew that in the final analysis, the integrity of this office--public faith in the integrity of this office--would have to take priority over all personal considerations.<br /><br />Today, in one of the most difficult decisions of my Presidency, I accepted the resignations of two of my closest associates in the White House--Bob Haldeman, John Ehrlichman--two of the finest public servants it has been my privilege to know.<br /><br />I want to stress that in accepting these resignations, I mean to leave no implication whatever of personal wrongdoing on their part, and I leave no implication tonight of implication on the part of others who have been charged in this matter. But in matters as sensitive as guarding the integrity of our democratic process, it is essential not only that rigorous legal and ethical standards be observed but also that the public, you, have total confidence that they are both being observed and enforced by those in authority and particularly by the President of the United States. They agreed with me that this move was necessary in order to restore that confidence.<br /><br />Because Attorney General Kleindienst-though a distinguished public servant, my personal friend for 20 years, with no personal involvement whatever in this matter-has been a close personal and professional associate of some of those who are involved in this case, he and I both felt that it was also necessary to name a new Attorney General.<br /><br />The Counsel to the President, John Dean, has also resigned.<br /><br />--<br /><br />He also named Elliot Richardson as the new Attorney General, and gave him the authority to name a special prosecutor.<br /><br />Later, he spoke on the phone to Bob Haldeman:<br /><br />--<br /><br />President Nixon: Hello?<br /><br />Haldeman: Hi.<br /><br />President Nixon: I hope I didn't let you down.<br /><br />Haldeman: No, sir. You got your points over, and now you've go it set right and move on. You're right where you ought to be.<br /><br />President Nixon: Well, it's a tough thing, Bob, for you and for John and the rest, but Goddamn it, I'm never going to discuss the son-of-a-bitching Watergate thing again -- never, never, never, never. Don't you agree?<br /><br />Haldeman: Yes, sir. You've done it now, and you've laid out your position. You've laid out -- you've taken your steps...<br />[...]<br /><br />President Nixon: But let me say you're a strong man, Goddammit, and I love you.<br /><br />Haldeman: Well --<br /><br />President Nixon: And, you know, I love John and all the rest, and by God, keep the faith. Keep the faith. You're going to win this son of a bitch.<br /><br />Haldeman: Absolutely ...<br /><br />President Nixon: God bless America. I mean, I'm sure it must have driven you up the wall. It didn't drive me up the wall, but I felt that way.<br /><br />Haldeman. No, sir, not at all. No, I'm all for that, completely agree.<br /><br />President Nixon: I don't know whether you can call and get any reactions and call me back -- like the old style. Would you mind?<br /><br />Haldeman: I don't think I can. I don't --<br /><br />President Nixon: No, I agree.<br /><br />Haldeman: I'm in kind of an odd spot to try and do that.<br /><br />President Nixon: Don't call a goddamn soul. The hell with it.<br />[...]<br /><br />President Nixon: But God bless you, boy. God bless you.<br /><br />Haldeman: Okay.<br /><br />President Nixon: I love you, as you know.<br /><br />Haldeman: Okay.<br /><br />President Nixon: Like my brother.<br /><br />Haldeman: Well, we'll go on and up from here.<br /><br />President Nixon: All right, boy. Keep the faith.<br /><br />Haldeman: Right.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Nixon then accepts other calls, from various friends and allies. Most of it is just them flattering him; in most, he makes a point of it that Haldeman and Ehrlichman wouldn't volunteer to resign and forced him to order them to. One bit is worth noting in the call from Elliot Richardson:<br /><br />--<br /><br />Richardson: I've never -- I don't think I've never ever been with a group of people who were more moved by an occasion than this.<br /><br />President Nixon: Really? Really?...<br /><br />Richardson: And I won't let you down, Mr. President.<br /><br />President Nixon: Oh, I know that. I know that. That's why I named you [Laughter]...<br /><br />Richardson: I have the feeling that I think I can do it right. I really do.<br /><br />President Nixon: Of course you can. Of course you can. Elliot, the one thing they're going to be hitting you on is about the special prosecutor.<br /><br />Richardson: Yeah.<br /><br />President Nixon: The point is, I'm not sure you should have one. I'm not sure but what you should say you assume the responsibility for the prosecution and maybe bring that nice fellow [?] Hastings or whatever his name is, say he's -- but whatever you want. Good God, if you want, you know, to exhume Charles Evans Hughes, you know, do it. I don't mind. [Laughter]<br /><br />Richardson: Okay. Well, I'm thinking about it, and I met with Henry Petersen this afternoon.<br /><br />President Nixon: Right.<br /><br />Richardson: And I talked with him about it, and I'll think about it some more.<br /><br />President Nixon: Do what you want, and I'll back you to the hilt. I don't give a damn what you do, I am for you. Do you understand? Get to the bottom of this sonofabitch.<br /><br />Richardson: I do...<br /><br />--<br /><br />And so that's the end of this phase of the story, the collapse of the cover-up. More or less -- the prosecutors know most of the basic story of Gemstone, Liddy and Hunt, and Watergate; they know a fair amount about the Plumbers. The press knows much, but know all of that, yet. I notice that in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/3-top-nixon-aides-kleindienst-out-president-accepts-full-responsibility-richardson-will-conduct-new-probe/2012/06/04/gJQAx7oFJV_story.html">one WaPo story</a>,&nbsp;Laurence Stern and Haynes Johnson write that "He also announced that he had fired his counsel, John W. Dean III, who was by the ironies of the political process a casualty of the very scandal the President had charged him to investigate." Less ironic if you realize that there was not presidential charge, and no investigation; that was all a sham.<br /><br />For a full sense of the immediate reaction, the Post's coverage is a good place to start; in addition to that story on the staff shake-up, there another <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/nixon-pledges-no-whitewash-on-watergate/2012/06/04/gJQAhCTGJV_story.html">on the speech</a>, another <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/haldeman-intensely-loyal-key-to-access-to-nixon/2012/06/04/gJQArExEJV_story.html">on Haldeman</a>, and an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/editorial-watergate-the-unfinished-business/2012/06/04/gJQAUaZFJV_story.html">editorial</a>.<br />

Oy, Fournier<-----><div class="tr_bq"><a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/obama-channels-clinton-s-worst-day-in-office-raises-doubts-about-relevancy-20130430">Ron Fournier</a>:</div><br /><blockquote>A president is in trouble when hes forced to defend his relevancy, as Bill Clinton did 18 years ago, or to quote Mark Twain, as Barack Obama did today. Rumors of my demise, he said at a news conference, may be a little exaggerated at this point.<br /><br />Not wrong  just exaggerated. Not forever  just at this point.<br /><br />Parsing aside, Obama channeled Clintons April 18, 1995 news conference by projecting a sense of helplessness  or even haplessness  against forces seemingly out of a presidents control...<br /><br />So my question to you, ABC reporter Jonathan Karl asked Obama, is do you still have the juice to get the rest of your agenda through Congress?<br /><br />Ouch. Well, if you put it that way, Jonathan, Obama quipped, maybe I should just pack up and go home. Golly. Then he quoted the humorist Twain, who once denied his death....<br />[T]he president risks losing the publics faith when he waves the white flag too often, especially on problems that can be fixed. Blaming the GOP and larger structural problems dont help the country, much less his legacy.</blockquote>Interesting theory! If only we could find a way to test it.<br /><br />Oh, wait -- I know. &nbsp;We can look it up and see what happened.<br /><br />When Clinton was supposedly projecting helplessness, <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/124922/Presidential-Approval-Center.aspx">Gallup was in the middle of a poll</a>, and he scored a fairly weak 46% approval rating. Did his widely-reported press conference destroy him? Was it a disaster for him to "wave the white flag too often" leading to his "losing the public's faith"? Uh, no. Actually, his approval was already up from the winter lows, and spiked up more after the Oklahoma City bombing, although that was short-lived. So it basically stayed in that same range through the summer, and then gradually started improving that fall, and didn't stop improving until he became a very popular second-term president.<br /><br />Oh, and along the way he was emerged victorious in a months-long budget battle with a Republican Congress.<br /><br />What Fournier may be remembering is that a lot of reporters jumped on Clinton's press conference remarks to write his obituary. What he's not remembering is that <i>those reporters were dead wrong</i>. It turned out that Clinton was in fact relevant; it turned out that reporters who were pressing him were the ones who misunderstood the situation.<br /><br />(Bonus feature: Fournier refers to John Boehner as "far less charismatic" than Newt Gingrich. I don't really know what charismatic means, but whatever the case is with Boehner, Newt Gingrich is unusually good at making himself very unpopular with most voters. Although there are will always be some reporters who buy his snake oil).<br /><br />There's sort of a confusion of terms here, anyway. It does matter, per Neustadt (and I think he's right), what Members of Congress and other "Washingtonians" think about the president's negotiating abilities. It doesn't matter, however, what the public at large think, since they're not the ones negotiating with him. It might matter how popular he is with the public at large, but that's likely based more on results (whether correctly attributed to the president or not) than with the inside baseball of Hill negotiations.<br /><br />At any rate..."relevant" wasn't a disaster for Bill Clinton, and doesn't even make a good symbol for his low point, which was several months earlier. What "relevant" really symbolizes is the ability of the press corps to misunderstand what's going on -- they didn't see, for a long time, that Newt Gingrich was a toxic disaster for Republicans and that Clinton, after two mostly awful and disappointing years, had improved his performance considerably and was also in good shape for becoming popular as well.<br /><br />Which doesn't mean that "demise" will turn out to be...well, the point is that it doesn't have any deep meaning at all. No matter how much some reporters want these things to work that way.<br />
C'mon, Take (More) Questions, Barack Obama<----->Barack Obama holds <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/newsconferences.php">relatively few press conferences</a> -- and must answer fewer questions when he does than any other president.<br /><br />At <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/president-obamas-april-30-2013-news-conference-transcript/2013/04/30/0edc67b0-b1a3-11e2-baf7-5bc2a9dc6f44_print.html">today's press conference</a> he called on six reporters. Granted, some of the questions were two entirely separate parts, but at best it was maybe eight or nine questions.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=44101">Here's a press conference from Ronald Reagan</a> in which, if I'm counting correctly, he took 23 questions, although here's a <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=38608">later one</a> in which he took just 9. Counting question is sometimes pretty tricky; here's <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=18650">one with George H.W. Bush</a>, after the tax reversal, with over a dozen separate questions, but lots of follow-ups on top of that. <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=54012">Bill Clinton answered 10 here</a>. And <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=63128">here's one where George W. Bush</a> took 19 question.<br /><br />Now, if Obama was coming out once a week or more, the way that FDR did, or even regularly twice a month, as the next few presidents did more or less, then half a dozen questions would be fine. But the combination of few press conferences and few questions stinks. And the apparent trade-off -- longer answers -- doesn't really make up for it, in my view.<br /><br />By the way, I thought the questions were pretty good today. Sure, Jonathan Karl's "do you still have the juice to get the rest of your agenda through this Congress?" was phrased in a silly way, but of course after a presidential priority is defeated in the Senate, he's going to get that type of question. They covered immigration, the hunger strikes at Gitmo, the Boston bombing, ACA implementation, Syria...all good topics; the only really misstep was a Benghazi question. But no North Korea, no Afghanistan corruption question, no question about any of his blocked nominees (or his failure to nominate anyone for many judicial and executive branch posts), and plenty more.<br /><br />Anyway, I have no idea whether it's a deliberate strategy to answer as few questions as possible, or he's just naturally long-winded in this context. But while I don't think he's particularly good at the format -- I'd say that Clinton and George H.W. Bush were solidly better, and I suppose I should toss JFK in there too -- he's also not someone that the staff needs to protect from doing it (as was the case with Reagan and George W. Bush). He should find a way to take more questions.

April 29, 1973<----->The newspapers are demanding resignations; Haldeman, when he reads them, realizes that the fight for leaves is probably over. And in fact, Nixon calls from Camp David to summon him and Ehrlichman for early afternoon meetings, with Ziegler calling back to let Haldeman know that the decision has been made: both of them would resign, and Dean would be fired. On top of that, Nixon is having Attorney General Kleindienst resign, and replacing him with Secretary of Defense Elliot Richardson.<br /><br /><a name="more"></a><br />Meanwhile, Nixon is busy that morning. Kissinger calls him, and Nixon moves the subject to the "Kissinger taps" -- wiretaps of journalists and government officials designed to find leaks during the early part of the administration.<br /><br />--<br /><br />President Nioxn: [...] Now, there's one area, of course, where you and I have to be concerned about it and where we've got to stand firm as hell. As you know, Henry, we do do -- we did do some surveillance with the FBI on these leaks, you remember?<br /><br />Kissinger: Oh, yes.<br /><br />President Nixon: And they were approved, approved by the Attorney General and so forth. When they come out, we've just got to say. Of course, you remember the whole business. People have forgotten.<br />[...]<br />Kissinger: The '69 ones I knew about...<br /><br />President Nixon: But they were done, and I've got to defend those as national security leaks and we've got to do it in the future, you know. By golly, when we've got leaks I'm going to order bugging. Don't you agree?<br /><br />Kissinger: Well, if it's a question of national security, approved by the Attorney General, I don't see what anyone can say about it.<br /><br />President Nixon: That's correct, correct. The problem we've got with some of this in the Ellsberg stuff, you see, Edgar Hoover wouldn't do the job because [Patricia] Marks, his closest friend's daughter, was married to Ellsberg and wouldn't do it, and that's why some of that crap was done in the White House. But that's too bad. That's just one of those things.[...]<br /><br />--<br /><br />Pretty straightforward: Nixon is making sure that everyone who could testify against him knows that they, too, have guilty knowledge or worse.<br /><br />Even at this point, with Haldeman and Ehrlichman getting to the helicopter to come to Camp David, Nixon is still going back and forth, talking to Ziegler and Bill Rogers about resignation vs. leaves. Nixon is also afraid that he won't really be able to do it, especially if one or the other of them fights it.<br /><br />Haldeman and Ehrlichman hardly talk in the helicopter. When they get there, Ziegler grabs Haldeman, and warns him that Nixon himself is talking about resigning. Haldeman immediately discounts it: "I told him that I was sure that was not the case, that it was part of his steeling himself for meeting with us, that he's creating a big crisis he knew he couldn't meet in order to be able to meet the lesser crisis he has to meet."<br /><br />Haldeman's diary:<br /><br />--<br /><br />He made the points on why he had to do it, but he's come to the conclusion that he has to have our resignations. He wants us to stay on to handle the transition. Then he went through his whole pitch about how he's really the guilty one. He said he's thought it all through, and that he was the one that started Colson on his projects, he was the one who told Dean to cover up, he was the one who made Mitchell Attorney General, and later his campaign manager, and so on. And that he now has to face that and live with it, and that for that reason, after he gets his other things completed, that he too will probably have to resign. He never said that directly, but implied it.<br /><br />--<br /><br />The meeting is filled with Nixon's sentiment; Haldeman tells him, at least, that while he disagrees with the decision he'll abide by it, and that Nixon has to stay and fight on.<br /><br />Then the meeting with Ehrlichman, which apparently goes better than Nixon expected after the previous night's phone call. Haldeman goes back after that, and Nixon goes over it with him; Haldeman notes that Nixon is still shaken from what Ehrlichman had said in that previous conversation.<br /><br />And then Kleindienst, who hard already realized that his position was impossible, meets with the president and is told that he, too, is to resign, and be included in the same batch as Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Dean. He protests -- he wants to wait and so not be lumped into those three, all of them facing likely indictment -- but Nixon insists (and, it seems perfectly fair to me; while Kleindienst never was prosecuted for Watergate, his decision to ignore Gordon Liddy's confession at the golf course immediately after the arrests -- while serving as the Attorney General of the United States -- was as much of a disgrace to his office as anything the rest had done, and the cover-up would have been over before it started had he immediately passed what Liddy said along to the FBI and the prosecutors).<br /><br />And then Elliot Richardson. Richardson, before accepting the job, questioned Nixon on Watergate and received an absolute assurance that he had no involvement.<br /><br />The rest of that Sunday is spent working on Nixon's speech to the nation, scheduled for Monday night. Gallup was finishing up a survey while they were working at Camp David. When it was tabulated and released, the result was that Nixon had fallen to 48% approval, matching his June 1971 low, and down nine points since the beginning of April.
Catch of the Day<----->It goes to Jamelle Bouie, who has a <a href="http://prospect.org/article/conservatives-try-rewrite-civil-rights-history-again">terrific response</a> to the latest exercise in fantasy party history by the National Review's Kevin Williamson. As he says, it's based on<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">a heavily revisionist history of American politics, in which the GOP never wavered in its commitment to black rights, and the Democratic Party embraced its role as a haven for segregationists. In this telling of history, black support for Democrats is a function of liberal demagoguery and crude identity politics. If African Americans truly understood their interests, the argument goes, theyd have never left the Republican Party.</blockquote>Williamson's focus this time is on a specific episode in Barry Goldwater's career. I have no idea whether Williamson is correct or not about it...it doesn't really matter. The point is that Williamson uses his anecdote in defense of, once again, his totally bizarre version of party history.<br /><br />Bouie does an excellent job of briefly reviewing the real party history that Williamson, somehow or another, manages to ignore. Basically, Williamson still wants us to think that the Democratic Party was (and still is, but in disguise) nothing but George Wallace, and that the GOP was and still is nothing but Jacob Javits. He somehow or another manages to miss the epic battle between the segregationists and liberals within the Democrats -- and also misses the part in which civil rights Republicans were driven from their party.<br /><br />Now, Williamson is trying to make Goldwater into a hero of civil rights, despite his vote against the Civil Rights Act. The point is that it really doesn't matter whether Goldwater was personally a bigot, or even a champion of civil rights on particular circumstances, or not. What matters is that the people who actually cared about civil rights supported legislation that Goldwater opposed -- and what matters far more is that over time the people who opposed civil rights lost their battle within the Democratic Party, but beginning with Strom Thurmond they found a home in the GOP. That's not to say that the GOP became a segregationist party; that would be taking it too far. But it's not only true that by the 1980s most opponents of the civil rights agenda wound up in the Republican Party, but also that the heirs of the civil rights Republicans really just aren't welcome in the today's GOP.<br /><br />Seriously, it's as if Williamson just thinks that belief in the existence of Hubert Humphrey, Adam Clayton Powell, and other civil rights Democrats is sort of like believing in UFOs. He also seems to believe that it's necessary to recover the well-known facts about the old segregationist Democrats. As I've said before: it's perfectly reasonable to investigate the complicity of such figures as Adlai Stevenson and Franklin Roosevelt in that story. It just has very little to do with what was happening within the Democratic Party by 1964, and absolutely nothing to do with the Democratic Party by the 1980s, let alone the 2010s.
Post-Policy GOP and Sequestration<----->Ezra Klein and Evan Soltas <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/29/wonkbook-with-sequestration-everyone-loses-even-republicans/">write</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Republicans wanted entitlement cuts. Theyre not getting them. They wanted to protect defense spending. Instead, the Pentagon is getting gutted while Medicare and Social Security are left mostly untouched. They had an eye toward tax reform. Nuh-uh.</blockquote>That is, keeping sequestration in place is, they write, lose-lose when it comes to policy.<br /><br />Which would be absolutely true if Republicans really did want entitlement cuts, defense spending, tax reform, or, as they go on to discuss, long-term deficit reduction.<br /><br />If, however, we take the "post-policy" idea seriously, then it's a little easier to understand. Republicans, for example, are rhetorically in favor of "entitlement" cuts, but they have opposed actual Medicare cuts and some of them opposed Barack Obama's chained-CPI proposal, too. Those post-policy Republicans are happy to bash "entitlements," but what they're for? It appears that what they're for is for Democrats to propose cuts in Medicare and Social Security that they can then oppose.<br /><br />Granted: clearly some Republicans want (for example) higher defense spending, including both Republican politicians and GOP-aligned interest groups. But in the aggregate, it's really not clear that "Republicans" care very much about any of these things other than as excuses for rhetoric positioning. In that sense, Republicans may be less in favor of defense spending than they are in favor of being able to claim that Obama cut defense spending, and then having an excuse to blame any particular national security outcome on those defense cuts.<br /><br />I'm not sure one can prove this one way or another, but it sure seems to me that the post-policy idea works really well at explaining what we're seeing.

April 28, 1973<----->"Told me to get the statements written in the best possible way. Says he isn't going to mention our names in his TV talk Monday."<br /><br />That's Haldeman's report of his morning phone conversation with Nixon; the president is at Camp David, and the decision has been made that Haldeman and Ehrlichman will both take a leave, not resign. Nixon wants them to come to Camp David, but their lawyer wants them to wait until the next day, and so they spend the Saturday writing their statements requesting leaves until their names are cleared.<br /><br /><a name="more"></a><br />The president knows he has to let them go, but still slides all over the place. Here, just before calling Haldeman, he speaks on the phone to Ron Ziegler:<br /><br />--<br /><br />Ziegler: Are Bob [Haldeman] and John [Ehrlichman] coming up today [to Camp David]?<br /><br />President Nixon: That's what they tell me. That's what they tell me. You know, I don't know, I don't know. As you know, this is going to be a painful session. God I don't -- do you see -- Jesus. Do you see anything, now that they, with all of this, that they really should hang on? What's your feeling on that?<br /><br />Ziegler: My feeling is the same, Mr. President.<br /><br />President Nixon: That they better move now or the time will be gone?<br /><br />Ziegler: Yes, sir.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Nixon then calls Haldeman, and agrees that they can wait until tomorrow; Haldeman and Ehrlichman's lawyers are putting a lot of weight on how they leave, compared to how Dean leaves, so they continue to talk about that. Nixon, however, has something else on his mind:<br /><br />--<br /><br />President Nixon: ...I wanted to ask you a question. You know, I mark things in news summaries now and then, you know, to do this, Good God, check on this, what the hell's this guy doing, and so forth and so on.<br /><br />Haldeman: Yeah.<br /><br />President Nixon: It was not your practice to just make multiliths of those and send them to fellows like Dean and so forth? They don't have the verbatims of that stuff stuff, do they?<br /><br />Haldeman: No. They have -- what they have is a memo from the staff secretary saying it's been requested that you check such and such.<br /><br />President Nixon: Does it indicate the president has requested?<br /><br />Haldeman: No.<br /><br />President Nixon: Good. That's fine.<br /><br />Haldeman: And it doesn't ask for a report back to the president. It says: Please report back to the staff secretary on your actions, or something, by April 15th.<br /><br />President Nixon: Good, good. Well, that's perfectly all right.<br /><br />Haldeman: And then the originals of those go into your file...That was standard procedure.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Nixon has already asked Ziegler that morning about what might have; it sounds here that he's wondering whether anyone has put down on paper some of the things he's asked his senior staff to do -- breaking into Brookings, for example.<br /><br />Ziegler speaks to Haldeman, pressing him to just resign and be done with it. And then again to Nixon, who adds one new factor:<br /><br />--<br /><br />President Nixon: ...I just talked to my daughter Tricia, who came up to tell me -- you know, she's a sweet child -- and told me the family and Pat [Nixon] that they felt strongly that Haldeman and Ehrlichman should resign.<br /><br />--<br /><br />That's late morning. Nixon checks back in with Ziegler in the evening; by now, he's moved in the direction, again, of resignations rather than leaves. Ziegler reports on what the press has that day:<br /><br />--<br /><br />President Nixon: Fine. Any other developments I should know about?<br /><br />Ziegler: No, nothing of major importance in the scope of all of this. The direction of the story seemed to be going to the Plumbers operation.<br /><br />President Nixon: Yeah.<br /><br />Ziegler: Specifically the Pentagon Papers [Fielding] break-in, but also the cable [forged by Hunt] regarding the death of or the overthrow of Diem.<br /><br />President Nixon: Yeah, which was some sort of a fake, wasn't it?<br /><br />Ziegler: Yes.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Haldeman was almost convinced by Ziegler, but their lawyer argues strongly for leave. Still, Haldeman at least is ready for that. John Ehrlichman, however, calls Nixon that night and pushes some, although Nixon tells him that leaves are done deal (not saying, however, that he's actually moved on to resignations rather than leaves). Nixon and Ehrlichman go over the Fielding break-in and the forged Diem cable, with each man pushing the other on culpability. Nixon, for example, says that he never knew about the forged cable, but Ehrlichman challenges that...and, at the same time, is sure to mention "your friend Colson." Nixon, meanwhile, claims that he never had heard of Hunt until after Watergate, which wasn't true. On the other hand, Ehrlichman claims that he was only involved in the Plumbers, and not in Watergate including the cover-up, which wasn't true either; Ehrlichman had been involved in the effort to "shut off" the FBI by using the CIA.<br /><br />Nixon's memoir has Ehrlichman saying that "all the illegal acts ultimately derived from me [that is, Nixon]."
Sunday Question for Liberals<----->Since I think I'm writing about this soon: holding spending the same, which do you prefer: higher taxes (written, let's say, by liberals, so making taxes more progressive) or taxes where they are and a larger deficit?
Sunday Question for Conservatives<----->George W. Bush: conservative president, or not? What's underrated about him? What does the conventional critique get right?
April 27, 1973<----->Floods in Mississippi. The President flies down there and back, meeting with Haldeman on the way there (and earlier in the morning) and both Haldeman and Ehrlichman on the way back. More of the same: would they take a leave? Resign? An indefinite leave or a 30 day leave? At one point, there's a proposal that they take a vacation? Nixon pretty clearly has decided that they're gone, but he's not able to simply say it, and so this has been going on all week.<br /><br />Pat Gray, the story of destroying the material in Hunt's safe having reached the press, finally puts himself out of his misery and resigns. Gray, for some reason, is never prosecuted. Agents opened his office safe after he left, and found Watergate materials he had obtained from the CIA and never passed along to the people investigating the case.<br /><br />Kleindienst and Nixon talk on the phone about that after Nixon gets back from Mississippi:<br /><br />--<br /><br />Kleindienst: ...In view of Pat's resignation, Mr. President, it would be my recommendation that I just administratively permit Mark Felt, who --<br /><br />President Nixon: No, I tell you. I don't want him. I can't have him. I just talked to Bill Ruckelshaus and Bill is a Mr. Clean and I want a fellow in there that is not part of the old guard and that is not part of that infighting in there.[...] He'll do it as acting director until we get a full director.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Mark Felt was already passed over once when Gray was installed Acting Director, and Nixon was right to not trust him: he was the source feeding Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein information as "Deep Throat."<br /><br />Next, a call with Henry Petersen:<br /><br />--<br /><br />Petersen: ...I just wanted to call you and give you a report on that -- on the Ellsberg case.<br /><br />President Nixon: Yes.<br /><br />Petersen: Judge Byrne had opened it up last night and was inclined to the view that disclosure to him was sufficient.<br /><br />President Nixon: Yeah.<br /><br />Petersen: And then apparently overnight he changed his opinion.<br /><br />President Nixon: Right.<br /><br />Petersen: And read the memorandum from Silbert to me in open court, indicated that the defendants were entitled to a hearing on it, requested disclosure of the source, which I've authorized, and asked for all the information the government has. We don't have anything.<br /><br />--<br /><br />In some ways, the whole point of the cover-up was to keep the Plumbers operations, the whole "White House horrors," secret. Now not only is the cover-up of Watergate blown beginning with McCord's accusations, but everything else is coming out. And while the judge doesn't declare a mistrial at this point, the whole point of the Plumbers -- the operation to get Ellsberg rather than just let the law take its course -- now is close to letting Ellsberg go free.The trial is suspended for now, with Judge Byrne waiting for the government to double-check whether there's any more information they have on Ellsberg that the didn't turn over. It is, of course, another <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F70E10FA38551A7493CAAB178FD85F478785F9">headline story</a>.<br /><br />Petersen also comes to his senses and refuses Nixon's earlier request of detailing the government's case against Haldeman and Ehrlichman, saying; " I don't think I can produce. I'll tell you why. Most of the information -- almost everything they have -- [...] It's all grand jury." Nixon accepts it, but it must be a blow; if Petersen isn't going to keep him informed over everything the prosecutors are up to, his situation (not to mention the situations of Haldeman and Ehrlichman) are set back considerably.<br /><br />Petersen then says that, with negotiations with Dean stalled, he no longer has any advice against Nixon firing Dean, but he also presses Nixon to get rid of Haldeman and Ehrlichman as soon as possible.<br /><br />Haldeman then comes in, and they go over the March 21 tape again. Nixon's concern this time is that it can't be read as ordering Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.<br /><br />Later that night, Nixon meets with Ron Ziegler, his press secretary who he's now talking to more now as Haldeman and Ehrlichman are on the way out and Chuck Colson is gone. The conversation turns, early on, to the biggest topic there is...<br /><br />--<br /><br />President Nixon: [...] I can do quite a job of that Goddamn press, I hate to do it, but I will. I have to. But tell me this, in spite of all their vindictiveness and so forth, they -- the press still wants the President to come out all right? I mean -- I mean my -- except for [pundit Martin] Agronsky and a few others, they don't call for impeachment so far. I heard on the Agronsky show they had --<br /><br />Ziegler: they didn't call for impeachment. They referred to it, you know, the wording.<br /><br />President Nixon: Christ, impeach the President on John Dean -- John Dean's word. [Pause] I wonder what documentary stuff Dean's talking about. He claims he's goe some documentary stuff. [...]<br /><br />[And then later in the conversation]<br /><br />President Nixon: ...But they can't want frankly to see Agnew be President.<br /><br />Ziegler: That's right.<br /><br />President Nixon: No, really. You know -- well, I don't think of impeachment, good God Almighty, the point is they've got to want this country to succeed. The whole hopes of the whole Goddamn world of peace, Ron, you know, where they rest, they rest right here in this damn chair. [...]<br /><br />--<br /><br />Nixon is heading to Camp David for the weekend, and he concludes his conversation with Ziegler about the outlines for a speech to the nation on Watergate, a speech which will mark the end of the White House service of his top two staff members. He talks about how hard it has been to actually get them to resign, but the mechanics of doing the deed are already well on their way on this Friday night.
What Mattered This Week?<----->I don't know that it was the most important thing of the week, but the Obama Administration filed their appeal on the recess appointment decision; of course, the appeal was expected, but the case matters quite a bit (also, I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/04/26/restore-recess-appointments/">wrote about it</a> yesterday).<br /><br />Nice to get all the presidents together, but attempts to rehabilitate George W. Bush aren't going to work, and &nbsp;don't really matter.<br /><br />That's what I have. What did you notice? What do you think mattered this week?
April 26, 1973<----->The day starts with yet another long Nixon-Haldeman meeting, assessing where they are and what, if anything, they can do about it. The same issues, most notably still searching for a strategy for Dean. Should he be fired? Given immunity? What can keep him from turning on Nixon? What can discredit him, thus helping Haldeman and Ehrlichman? And always, the undercurrent: what if the interests of the conspirators diverge?<br /><br />Haldeman, with Ehrlichman, go off on another marathon meeting with their lawyers at midday. The president has his first in a series of calls with Attorney General Kleindienst about the Fielding break-in and other matters. Of course, Nixon isn't exactly honest with his AG:<br /><br /><a name="more"></a><br />--<br /><br />President Nixon: We've done the right thing [by disclosing the Fielding break-in], and these clowns [Hunt and Liddy] get out and do such stupid Goddamn things as that, we've got to take the blame for it. You know.<br /><br />Kleindienst: Yes. Well, I think we can obviate a lot of that in this situation, though.<br /><br />President Nixon: How?<br /><br />Kleindienst: Well, I think the fact that, you know, when it came to our attention -- i.e., yours, mine -- you know, we made an immediate disclosure.<br /><br />President Nixon: Oh, yeah, that, of the event. But I mean the fact that it was done, you know.<br /><br />Kleindienst: Oh..<br /><br />President Nixon: The fact that it was done. As you know, it was not authorized. This is a case where these guys had the responsibility when they were at the White House to conduct an investigation of the Ellsberg thing due to the fact that Hoover would not. And so they go out [chuckles] and do this sort of thing.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Virtually none of that is true. Nixon hardly disclosed it immediately; it was authorized; and while it's true that Hoover wouldn't extend the investigation of Ellsberg beyond what was needed to arrest and charge him, to say that there was any "responsibility" to find dirt on Ellsberg so the government could smear him in the press is not only wrong, but it's backwards; the government in fact has a responsibility <i>not</i> to publicly smear a defendant awaiting trial. &nbsp;They talk more, especially about what John Dean's "trump card" might be -- something big that Dean has threatened he'll still reveal. Kleindienst, for whatever it's worth, reassures the president; the Attorney General doesn't think Dean is very believable.<br /><br />After the meeting with lawyers, Haldeman spent most of the afternoon listening to White House tapes. It's worth pointing out just how hard that must have been -- the transcripts from the 1990s, using the best technology available then, still misses a fair amount. Haldeman was probably working with a cheap tape player. Later in the afternoon, and after also reviewing his own files and notes for March, he reports back to the president, and they talk Watergate for a while. Nixon then checks in with Kleindienst again, who has nothing from the Ellsberg trial in California, and then checks in with John Ehrlichman, who has more bad news: the New York Times has the story about Pat Gray destroying the material from Hunt's safe.<br /><br />Nixon first calls Kleindienst about it, asking whether Gray (who is still not only Acting Director but still, after all this, the nominee for the permanent FBI job) should resign immediately and claiming that the important thing is to get the story out publicly immediately. That done, he gets Henry Petersen on the phone.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Petersen: ...Dean tells me, and he told me this well before, Ehrlichman had told him to destroy these documents.<br /><br />President Nixon: Dean says that Ehrlichman told Dean to destroy them?<br /><br />Petersen: That's right. And Dean said, "You know, Goddamn it, I wasn't going to do it."<br /><br />President Nixon: That's the so-called "deep-six" thing?<br /><br />Petersen: That's right. And that he Dean wasn't going to do it, so they both in effect gave it to Gray.<br /><br />President Nixon: [...] I can't really believe that anybody's going to believe that the Director of the FBI was handed some documents and told to destroy them. You know what I mean?<br /><br />Petersen: Well, he's going to come out looking awfully stupid, to say the least.<br />[...]<br /><br />President Nixon: Well, I don't believe that. I don't know whether -- see, the point is when you say that Dean and the deep-six thing and so forth, you haven't said Ehrlichman. I mean, you haven't had that corroborated yet, because basically Ehrlichman was in the room [...]. I'm going to have to talk to him about this and ask him.<br />[...]<br /><br />President Nixon: All right. On the Gray thing, it seems to me that Gray, that you should have your meeting with Gray immediately, the three [ the prosecutors?] of you. Don't have him make a statement, however, until -- I don't know if he should even make one tonight. You know what I mean.<br /><br />Petersen: Yes.<br /><br />President Nixon: I'm not sure I would react that soon. I don't know, but at least that was Dick [Kleindienst]'s feeling, that maybe we shouldn't act tonight.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Nixon, here, is desperately trying to keep the blame squarely on either Dean or Gray, but not on Ehrlichman, even though he knows that all three are guilty on it. He then finishes by, again, pumping Petersen on the progress of the case and whether Dean will be given immunity or not. He does learn that Jeb Magruder, finally, is ready to cut a deal. That means they'll have his evidence on the original break-in, but they're still trying to nail down that case -- without Dean, it would just be Magruder's word against Mitchell's. They know they'll make that, but while Nixon has already written off the CRP group, the prosecutors need to take it one step at a time.<br /><br />Ehrlichman, at this point, is denying the story of his culpability on Hunt's safe to the newspapers. Gray, meanwhile, goes in to meet with Kleindienst and Petersen. And Nixon calls over again. Kleindienst reports to him that Gray is now saying that Dean told him, in Ehrlichman's presence, that the material "should never see the light of day," but that Gray only inferred from that that he should destroy it.<br /><br />Nixon then brings the discussion to Dean, and volunteers to Kleindienst:<br /><br />--<br /><br />President Nixon: [...] ... I never saw him [Dean] personally till -- never saw him about this, and then it was about -- because of the Gray confirmation thing -- until February 22.<br /><br />Kleindienst: Is that right?<br /><br />President Nixon: Never.<br /><br />Kleindienst: You never discussed this matter with him at all --<br /><br />President Nixon: Never.<br /><br />Kleindienst: -- until February 22?<br /><br />President Nixon: that's right.<br /><br />Kleindienst: That is a very --<br /><br />President Nixon: Or February -- wait a minute. Let me just check my book here. 27th -- 27th.<br /><br />Kleindienst: Of February?<br /><br />President Nixon: 27th of February. That's right.<br /><br />Kleindienst: You mean he was not in your office?<br /><br />President Nixon: Never, except one time, to sign my wills.<br /><br />Kleindienst: Is that right?<br /><br />President Nixon: That's right [...]<br /><br />Kleindienst: You know, to listen to this little bastard he's in there talking to you four time a day.<br /><br />President Nixon: Oh, he has been since then. He was --<br /><br />Kleindienst: But even last summer, you know.<br /><br />President Nixon: Last summer, I never -- well, let's get one thing straight. [Kulter here adds: "spoken with emphasis, pausing between words" and Kulter adds emphasis here] I, the President, never saw John Dean once except for the signing of the wills....And that was on August 14. August 14. I signed my wills. that's the only time I ever saw him...<br /><br />--<br /><br />This was a lie, since they met <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2012/09/september-15-1972.html">on September 15</a>, when the original indictments were handed down and Dean gave an extensive report about the case.<br /><br />Beyond that, Nixon continues talking to Haldeman, who is in his office during these last calls, about "separation" &nbsp;-- whether Haldeman and Ehrlichman should resign, take leaves of absence (which Haldeman realizes by now is just a euphemism, since it would be permanent) or stay. Nixon does get as far this time as asking them to prepare letters requesting leave while they fight the case, between that meeting and two calls after Haldeman goes home. Haldeman, by now, seems to realize that Nixon has basically decided to have them both leave, but can't manage to spell it out -- and with their lawyer saying that it's better off if they stay, Haldeman isn't helping the president by offering to quit.
The Return of Lazy Mendacity<----->Oliver Willis yesterday <a href="https://twitter.com/owillis/status/327433062206033920">asked</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">what is it with cons[ervatives] who provide links to stories that disprove their accusations?</blockquote>Hey, I know that one! It's lazy mendacity.<br /><br />On a totally different substantive topic, Conor Friedersdorf had a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/04/proving-a-conservative-caricature-of-boston-bombing-coverage-wrong/275293/">great example of lazy mendacity</a>, also yesterday -- conservatives linking to a NYT story about Boston and quoting something from mid-story to support a claim that the press was ignoring the bombers' religion, when in fact the headline and the lead (yeah, I spell it that way usually) were about "Islamic Extremist Beliefs As Motive." In other words, while Friedersdorf goes to great pains to show that the claim is wrong, all anyone really needed to do was to look at the story that was supplied as evidence.<br /><br />The point is that there's something about the conservative marketplace which encourages quite a bit of laziness on the part of those selling to it. You don't need to be clever; you don't need to show your work. All you need is to read the audience well and supply the kinds of outrage they're looking for. And, as conservatives should know, if you provide incentives for something, you'll get it. <br /><br />Of course, there certainly are very good pundits among conservatives, and solid, substantive politicians...it's just that the market rewards appear, for the most part, to be elsewhere. And so: lazy mendacity.

April 25, 1973<----->Nixon arrived back in Washington on the 24th, still without having resolved anything. Also on the Tuesday the 24th, John Mitchell <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F40913FD38551A7493C7AB178FD85F478785F9">testified</a> in front of a grand jury -- but not the Watergate one; this was an investigation related to financier (later fugitive financier) Robert Vesco.<br /><div><br /></div><div>At the White House, Haldeman and Ehrlichman meet with their lawyers, who then meet with Nixon. They're at a stalemate; Nixon clearly wants them to resign, but the lawyers don't want them to go, and Nixon isn't willing to force the issue yet.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The three co-conspirators -- the president, his chief of staff, and his other most important staff member -- meet in the late morning at the EOB office, where <a href="http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/trial/exhibit_31.pdf">Ehrlichman presses Nixon to come clean</a>:</div><div><a name="more"></a>--</div><div><br /></div><div><div>EHRLICHMAN: ...and if I can say go back and forth and on and so on, but (unintelligible) in thinking about this', I keep coming back to Dean because there are things that don't add up otherwise...</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: Right.</div><div><br /></div><div>EHRLICHMAN: ...in this whole thing.</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: That's right.</div><div></div><div>EHRLICHMAN: And, I don't know if you feel you can do this, but I think the three of us know one another well enough, that, we've been through enough together, but (unintelligible) (tape noise) necessary that we have your very candid...</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: Assessment?</div><div><br /></div><div>EHRLICHMAN: ...assessment of the threat to you. Obviously, neither one of us want to do anything to harm you in any way, we want to avoid harming you.</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: The threat (unintelligible) Dean?</div><div><br /></div><div>EHRLICHMAN: Yes, sir.</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: All right.</div><div><br /></div><div>EHRLICHMAN: Now, let me, let me just spin something out for you. As a, as a...</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: Right.</div><div><br /></div><div>EHRLICHMAN: ...it has a probably a far out point, as we work back...</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: Right.</div><div><br /></div><div>EHRLICHMAN: ...I think it's entirely conceivable that if Dean is totally out of control and if matters are not handled (unintelligible), that you could get a resolution of impeachment...</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: That's right.</div><div><br /></div><div>EHRLICHMAN: ...in the Senate...</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: That's right.</div><div><br /></div><div>EHRLICHMAN: ...I don't know if you've thought of this or not, but I got thinking about it last night. Uh, on the ground that you committed a crime.</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: Right.</div><div><br /></div><div>EHRLICHMAN: Uh, and that there is no other legal process available to, uh, uh, the United States people, other than...</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: Right.</div><div><br /></div><div>EHRLICHMAN: ...other than impeachment. Otherwise, you have immunity from prosecution.</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: Right.</div><div><br /></div><div>EHRLICHMAN: Uh, so I think we have to, I think we have &nbsp;to think about that. We have to (unintelligible)...</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: Right.</div><div><br /></div><div>EHRLICHMAN: ...and see about, see what the point is, is it a crime, if any, and uh, how serious it is, and would Dean, is a threat, and what we do about it. Uh, my own analysis is that what he has falls far short of any commission of a crime by you. So far as I know.</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: Yeah.</div><div><br /></div><div>EHRLICHMAN: I don't know what you may have talked about with him in those ten or twelve hours you</div><div>and he spent there in the months, months of February and March.</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: Right.</div><div><br /></div><div>EHRLICHMAN: Uh, but, uh, you get down to a point where you've got John Dean prancing in there and</div><div>saying, "The President said this and the President said that," and having somebody in your behalf come back and say, "No, the President didn't say that, and that's ridiculous." Uh, and, and, so you get a kind of credibility thing unless, like he seems to be doing, he's very busy, uh, dredging up corroborating evidence and looking for documentation or taking statements from people based on leads that may have developed from those conversations. And I think really the only way that I know to make a judgement on this is for you to listen to your tapes and see what actually was said then, or maybe for Bob to do it, or, or, somebody. See what was said there. And then analyze how big a threat that is</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: Right.</div><div><br /></div><div>EHRLICHMAN: If it didn't come out of those meetings, then I think it's imaginary.</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: Right.</div><div><br /></div><div>EHRLICHMAN: Because it then does not come out of your mouth, it comes by reason of the actions of,</div><div>or something that one of us said or did, and it can be handled. But if you're really confronted with that kind of a dilemna, or that kind of crisis in this thing, uh, I think before any other steps are taken, any precipitous steps (unintelligible) on us for that matter, uh, you better damn sure know...&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: That's right.</div><div><br /></div><div>EHRLICHMAN: ...what your hole card is.</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: I agree.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>--</div><div><br /></div><div>Ehrlichman, as far as we know, didn't know about the White House taping system; his suggestion to "listen to your tapes," Emery concludes, is to the habit they've all developed by now of taping each other.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>In response, Nixon comes closer to coming clean to them than he has in the past:</div><div><br /></div><div>--</div><div><br /></div><div><div>PRESIDENT: Well, let me suggest this, Bob, uh, you've got the conversation (unintelligible).</div><div><br /></div><div>HALDEMAN: Yeah.</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible).</div><div><br /></div><div>HALDEMAN: Yeah.</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: Now, let me say...</div><div><br /></div><div>HALDEMAN: Yeah.</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: ...(unintelligible) I think I remember, I would remember everything, except, you see, there's always a possibility that Dean may have discussed this case with (unintelligible). I know the Bittman</div><div>conversation, you know...</div><div><br /></div><div>HALDEMAN: Yeah.</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: ...I know however, that in that conversation, the question was raised of blackmail-- I know, however, that in that conver-, I also raised the question how much is it going to, would it cost...</div><div><br /></div><div>HALDEMAN: Yeah. (Unintelligible).</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: ...a million dollars. And I said facetiously, "Well, I guess we can get a million dollars." It was then that we started my whole investigation. Now, I don't know, how does that one sound to you?</div><div><br /></div><div>EHRLICHMAN: Well, that sounds tough and...</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: Yeah.</div><div><br /></div><div>EHRLICHMAN: ...uh, yet it's manageable.</div><div>(Unintelligible).</div><div>*************</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: Yeah. Point out that that was triggered.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>--</div><div><br /></div><div>Of course, it's still not exactly honest, since Nixon did not say it "facetiously." Nor does Nixon tell them that he brought the March 21 conversation back to the payoffs multiple times, or that he asked his secretary about money immediately after the conversation. Nor did he start "my own investigation" -- that's a cover story that the three of them concocted after the cover-up collapsed ten or so days ago.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Later during that meeting Haldeman does duck out to prepare to listen to the tapes, both to find out how bad it is and to prepare selective quotes to help them. Haldeman goes to Stephen Bull, Nixon's appointments aide who knew about the taping system:</div><div><br /></div><div>--</div><div><br /></div><div>Haldeman: [...] [H]ave him deliver to you the material for the period from March 10th to march 23rd. You know what I'm talking about?</div><div><br /></div><div>Bull. Yes, sir. Telephone?</div><div><br /></div><div>Haldeman: The whole shot. Have them put it in a suitcase or something. I don't know what form it's in. But put it in some kind of bag so it isn't obvious, and have them bring it to you. And also, get a machine that is technically capable of listening to it...The smallest and most simple such machine.</div><div>[...]</div><div>Haldeman: All right, and do it as quickly as possible.</div><div><br /></div><div>--</div><div><br /></div><div>Meanwhile, after sitting on news of the Fielding break-in for several days, Henry Petersen finally feels he has to act on it -- after all, Daniel Ellsberg is on trial. The next thing is the president gets a call from the Attorney General:</div><div><br /></div><div>--</div><div><br /></div><div>Kleindienst: ...I've got to see you right away.</div><div><br /></div><div>President Nixon: Why?</div><div><br /></div><div>Kleindienst: It came to my attention this morning the implications of Dean's statement to Silbert with respect to the Ellsberg case....</div><div><br /></div><div>--</div><div><br /></div><div>Ten minutes later, Kleindienst is in Nixon's hideaway in the Executive Office Building. He notifies the president about the Liddy/Hunt operation, and explains that it must be disclosed to the judge at the Ellsberg trial. Nixon doesn't deny the break-in (although he claims that "Dean was the one who implemented the whole thing,"), and tries to suggest as he did with Petersen that it's a national security matter and therefore out of bounds, but Kleindienst isn't buying:</div><div><br /></div><div>--</div><div><br /></div><div>Kleindienst: ...If we tell them, this is going to be out in the street tomorrow or two days from now, a week, and the law clearly dictates that we have to do -- it could be another Goddamn cover-up, you know.</div><div><br /></div><div>President Nixon: Right.</div><div><br /></div><div>Kleindienst: We can't have another cover-up, Mr. President.</div><div><br /></div><div>President Nixon: I don't want any cover-ups of anything. You know that.</div><div><br /></div><div>[...]</div><div><br /></div><div>Kleindienst: It seems to me, Mr. President, we've got to do this [tell the court] this afternoon. We've got to do this before we run the risk of this getting out in the streets...</div><div><br /></div><div>President Nixon: What is Dean -- what's he doing, pointing a gun basically at Ehrlichman?</div><div><br /></div><div>[...]</div><div><br /></div><div>President Nixon: It's gonna kill the [Ellsberg] case.</div><div><br /></div><div>Kleindienst: Oh, no, I don't think so. I don't think so...</div><div><br /></div><div>President Nixon: The other point is that Liddy and Hunt, of course, or Dean could say he was ordered to by Ehrlichman.</div><div><br /></div><div>Kleindienst: Sure. He could say he was to by you.</div><div><br /></div><div>President Nixon: No, he won't do that [...]</div><div><br /></div><div>--</div><div><br /></div><div>Nixon here is, although Kleindienst doesn't realize it, betraying more guilty knowledge; he knows exactly that Ehrlichman was the one who approved the Fielding operation. Although later in the conversation, Nixon claims "I haven't the slightest idea about the Goddamn thing," which is not true, either.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The conversation continues for a while on the subject of Dean, with Kleindienst too feeling betrayed by Dean.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Immediately afterwords, Haldeman comes back from listening to the tapes, and <a href="http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/trial/exhibit_32.pdf">reports in detail </a>about the March 21st conversation. His diary version:</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp;Haldeman's diary:</div><div><br /></div><div>--</div><div><br /></div><div>Then [after the late morning meeting with the president] I left to review the tapes. Did that and went back over and went over what's on the tapes, which had the P again very concerned because of the implications that are in there. The actual facts work out pretty well because he did a superb job of getting the information out of Dean, which is what he was after. But he's concerned that Dean may have had a tape recorder on him and would use the tape itself, which could be made to appear more damaging than the facts would actually testify.</div><div><br /></div><div>--</div><div><br /></div><div>Haldeman -- and he's the only one of these players who is not a lawyer -- apparently never did understand, to the end of his life, that what Nixon was up to (and what they were all up to) was a clear obstruction of justice, and even worse, perhaps, a massive betrayal of his oath of office. After all, Nixon as president is the chief executive, and he has been (as Haldeman knows) in possession of facts of criminal action for months -- and, even if he wasn't earlier, would clearly have been in possession of facts of criminal action after he spoke to Dean. Whether the Dean tape is sufficient for impeachment is largely a political question, but "the actual facts" hardly "work out pretty well" for Nixon. But Nixon realizes exactly how bad it is:</div><div><br /></div><div>--</div><div><br /></div><div><div>PRESIDENT: Well, (unintelligible). I said, well, that's-- we gotta keep the cap on it. We can get the money, huh? But I said&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>HALDEMAN: Ya see, you're trying it out.</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: Yeah.</div><div><br /></div><div>HALDEMAN: You're trying to see how far it goes. You said, "Is that your recommendation?" That's, you do that all the time. You ask people questions on the basis of--, to try and see what direction they're going.</div><div>That's...they're leading questions. But it doesn't mean that your statement is (unintelligible).</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: I said a million dollars. With a million dollars (unintelligible) clemency. You couldn't do it till after the '74 elections. That's an incriminating thing. His, his word against the President's.</div><div><br /></div><div>PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible) tape recorder in his pocket.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>--</div><div><br /></div><div>After that is over, Henry Petersen comes in, and Nixon and Petersen discuss, at length, the Dean situation. Nixon tells Petersen that all summer he had instructed everyone to tell the story, but that they had not done so; that he began his own investigation on March 21, having stayed out of it up to that point; and that he certainly had not approved paying off Hunt -- and that if Dean accused him of it, it would be a lie. Nixon also asks Petersen to put on paper for him the case against Haldeman (remember, Nixon has now replaced Dean as the point man to keep the conspirators informed of what Justice was up to).&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Next, and we're in the evening by now, are two conversations with Kleindienst, who has called the Ellsberg prosecutors with the big news. Nixon pushes him again: the judge in the case needs to know that "this is a national security investigation of the highest importance."&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>He also called Haldeman after the Petersen meeting and went over all of it. Then, later at night, he called Haldeman back <a href="http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/trial/exhibit_33.pdf">one more time</a>, asking if there's any way they can test for whether Dean was carrying a tape recorder on March 21. Again, it's pretty clear that Nixon, if not Haldeman, realized just how devastating that conversation was.</div>
Bush, Principles, and Presidenting<----->The discussion of George W. Bush's intelligence, or lack thereof, continues. My position on this, as I've said many times, is that I've heard him speak on baseball and he sounded sharp enough; I attributed the evidence of his presidency not as a lack of innate intelligence, but as a consequence of his lack of interest in the world of public affairs and policy.<br /><br />Two new contributions worth looking at. Kevin Drum <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/04/george-bush-was-no-dummy-how-about-if-we-leave-it">looks</a> at Keith Hennessey's anecdotes intended to show Bush's smarts and sees, instead, impatience and lack of interest in details. And Ed Kilgore wants to <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2013_04/smarts_and_ideology044357.php">blame GOP orthodoxy</a>, and not Bush at all, for the policies Bush adopted and urged.<br /><br />I think it's probably correct to say that Bush arrived at the policies he supported because they conformed to conservative ideology, or at least GOP orthodoxy, of the time. However, that's not good enough. All presidents are driven by what their party wants, and part of being a good president is finding ways to keep party actors happy. Even if it means supporting unpopular policies, in some cases.<br /><br />But presidents also need to know when to resist the party when the party wants something that won't work -- for the sake of the party, among other reasons, even though many party actors won't accept that.<br /><br />And even more critically, presidents have to resist the temptation to accept party ideas as invariably correct -- and then the temptation to try to do the right thing. Generally, presidents are asking for trouble when they try to do whatever they believe is, in the abstract, the "right thing." That's true if it's "right" for ideological reasons, as with (perhaps) Bush; it's true if it's "right" based on the president's moral intuition, as was the case with Jimmy Carter or Woodrow Wilson.<br /><br />Presidents do not have any special claim to superior moral intuition, no matter what Carter or George W. Bush seem to believe. Nor do they have any special ability to channel the beliefs of "the people," as Wilson believed. When they attempt to do so -- when they attempt to base policy choices on their principles -- they are apt to get it all wrong, because there's no institutional reason that they should get it right. We might as well select our presidents by lot.<br /><br />What presidents do have -- and all elected officials have it, but presidents have more of it than anyone else in the system -- is access to the very best clues about what policies will be "viable" (in Neustadt's term). They have access to more, and more varied, information sources than anyone else. What's more, because their constituency is so large, they have access to the reactions of more, and more varied, organized groups than anyone else.Those reactions are often even better sources of information than the raw policy data that experts might give them (although to be sure the reactions of experts are an excellent source of information.<br /><br />Good presidenting, perhaps more than anything else, is the art of extracting information from political action and actors. What does it mean when this general says that an occupation will take more troops than his bosses at the Defense Department say it will take? What does it mean when this DoD official (representing what faction? How?) disagrees? What does it mean when this ally objects to the course the United States is taking; what does it man when that ally goes along? How much weight to give private statements, and how much to give public? When is the support or opposition being given for a policy pro forma, and when is it sincere and intense? And what is that intense support or opposition really saying about the policy?<br /><br />There are no magic formulas to answer those questions. It takes excellent governing skills: the ability to assess people and situations, deep knowledge of the political system and groups within it, a full sense of representational relationships. Some detailed policy knowledge can't hurt, although no president will have enough to substitute for those more general skills, and policy knowledge can even get in the way -- a determination to always do what's "right" can be just (almost?) as much of a problem if it's based on the president's personal policy expertise as it is if it's based on ideological principles or gut feelings.<br /><br />So, yes, I do think it's true of all presidents that they are heavily influence by their party's positions, and that's as it should be. But presidents also must know when to push back against their party's positions (or ignore them, or give lip service support to them).<br /><br />The difference, really, between Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush is that Reagan -- who surely was as much of an ideologue in some ways as Bush -- was at his best pretty good at seeing danger and avoiding it. George W. Bush? Spectacularly bad about seeing danger coming and avoiding it. That's not because Reagan (or other, even better presidents) had better "principles" or ideology or guts -- it's because they were excellent politicians. George W. Bush, alas, was a terrible politician, and a terrible president.
The Sad Death of Off-the-Record<----->One of the very useful bits of education I had as a grad student were the frequent visits from politicians, other political actors, and journalists to small lunch seminars hosted by Nelson W. Polsby's Institution of Governmental Studies. Some of them didn't depart from their normal talking points, but most of them spoke reasonably openly. Many of them also spent the day hanging out in Nelson's office, or stuck around for tea at the IGS later in the day. Some would also make guest appearances in undergrad classes, or otherwise share their time.<br /><br />Again, some of them were basically a waste of time. And of course even when they were "candid" you wouldn't want to take everything they said at face value. But we got a lot of good, partially revealing stories, a good way to get a sense of them individually, and cumulatively a good education in what politicians, national journalists, and political operatives were like.<br /><br /><br />If you've seen today's news, you know where this is going. Frank Luntz -- and regular readers know how much I dislike him, but I would have been happy to have him at an IGS noon seminar -- was giving a talk to some students, asked that part of it be off the record, only to have a recording of it <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/04/frank-luntz-rush-limbaugh-problematic-secret-tape">show up at Mother Jones today.</a><br /><br />Did anyone do anything wrong? I don't know. "Off the record" is, normally, an agreement between someone and reporters she's speaking with. Are bystanders covered? I'd say anyone who was in the room and didn't say anything was being dishonest to Luntz. How about Mother Jones? Given the very slight news value of the recording, I don't know that it was worth running, but Mother Jones isn't bound by someone else's agreement.<br /><br />The person who taped it, however, wasn't primarily betraying Luntz. He was betraying his fellow students -- and all fellow students. His actions, and the actions of anyone who does this sort of thing, make it impossible for public figures to speak candidly, or anything resembling candidly.<br /><br />Now, it's always been up to the judgement of the speaker in these sorts of situations to read the room and adjust. A large room full of undergrads is different than a couple dozen scholars and grad students. Evidently Luntz misread his audience here. But we want public figures to risk that sort of thing, and it's really too bad when they get burned for it. <br /><br />Of course, the stakes matter. It's one thing to expose what a presidential candidate says to supporters behind closed doors; it's quite another to expose something mildly embarrassing a political hack says.<br /><br />Anyway, given the current technology, this sort of thing is probably inevitable. But it's too bad. A real step in the wrong direction.
Read Stuff, You Should<----->Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0628040/">Christopher Newman</a>, 58. Nope, I never heard of him, either. But he was on the crew -- assistant director or some such on...ready? Match Point; Sense and Sensibility; Much Ado; Brazil; Return of the Jedi; The Great Muppet Caper; and Supermans II and III. Also, Rome -- and he's a producer on Game of Thrones. And lots more. That's not bad! Enough to even mean we should forgive whatever contributions he had to, alas, The Phantom Menace. <br /><br />Good stuff:<br /><br />1. Sean Trende on the <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/04/24/an_immigration_bonanza_for_democrats.html">possible electoral effects of passing immigration reform</a>.<br /><br />2. Okay, there are lots of good reasons not to like Dilbert, but the basic point of Dilbert is one worth knowing. Kevin Drum doesn't talk Dilbert, but makes a good point about <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/04/washington-post-wastes-125-news-11">real government waste</a>.<br /><br />3. Reid Wilson has a good overview of <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/columns/on-the-trail/the-week-that-kicked-off-the-battle-for-the-senate-20130425">Senate 2014 recent developments</a>.<br /><br />4.

Stochastic universe, anyone? Sarah Kliff has the story.
Judges, Please<----->The good news, as I discussed in the earlier item, is that the Senate is getting better at processing judicial nominations.<div><br /></div><div>The bad news? They're running out of nominations to process. Not because all the vacancies are filled. No, it's because the promised increased pace of judicial nominations still hasn't materialized.</div><div><br /></div><div>There remain around <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/JudgesAndJudgeships/JudicialVacancies/CurrentJudicialVacancies.aspx">60 spots without any nominee</a>, including 11 at the appellate level. And including three spots, still, on the DC Circuit. It's true that some of this is the Senate's fault, with (mostly) Republican Senators blocking home-state selections (and Democrats in the Senate supporting their ability to do so). Sure, Barack Obama isn't technically bound by that, but it's not unreasonable for him to choose to work things out rather than send up doomed nominees. But he hasn't used public pressure to get things moving (and this might be a case where that might help). Nor has he, as far as we know, aggressively bargained to get things moving. And he doesn't have any excuse for those DC Circuit spots.</div><div><br /></div><div>We've been hearing all year that Obama is really going to do better this time. Maybe he will. All I can say is that there's no evidence of it yet; there have only been a handful of new nominees so far this year, not enough to keep up with new vacancies.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Let's have some judicial nominees, please, Mr. President.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
Tentative Report Card on Senate Reform<----->The Senate just voted unanimously to confirm Jane Kelly, nominated by the president for the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. This is how it's supposed to work! Kelly was nominated on January 31 of this year for a brand-new opening, with Michael Malloy taking senior status. A circuit court spot filled in under three months? Well done, Barack Obama and the Senate!<br /><br />So, two things. One is that everyone has given Harry Reid a lot of grief over Senate reform, but it sure seems to me that things have been steadily improving. That's <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/JudgesAndJudgeships/JudicialVacancies/ConfirmationListing.aspx">five circuit court vacancies filled this year so far.</a> It leaves only four pending circuit court nominations. Granted, there's a 10th nominee who was defeated by filibuster. But again, and this is important: reform wasn't designed to change the 60 vote de facto requirement; it was designed to eliminate delays, or at least improve efficiency, while leaving the 60 vote Senate in place. Reformers may not like that goal, of course. But that's what they were trying to do, and I think there's a pretty good chance they've succeeded.<br /><br />On executive branch nominations, the story appears to be much the same. I count just a handful of executive branch nominations which have been <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/executive_calendar/xcalv.pdf">on the Senate calendar</a>&nbsp;-- that is, have cleared committee and should be available for a final vote -- longer than a couple of weeks. Now, I'm not sure how much of that is that they've been doing a good job of processing them, and how much of it has to do with delays elsewhere. But again, this is not how things were in the 112th or even the 111th Congress, when long delays were common even when there was no real opposition.<br /><br />It's not just nominations. Republican Senators were willing to vote cloture on the motion to proceed on the gun bill, allowing that legislation to get to the Senate floor. And reform also appeared to work both ways on that one -- Republicans were able to get votes on several of their amendments. Yes, it's all within the 60 vote Senate, and no, I don't think everything should be filibustered. But it's significantly better, within that, to at least have bills coming to the floor and to have something resembling an open amendments process. Even if it has to be with a 60 threshold.<br /><br />To be sure: it's not good enough. We're still seeing way, way, too many serious attempts to block executive branch nominations; those should be very rare. Nullification through nominations is still going on for selected positions. It should not be. It is still possible that Republicans are blockading the DC Circuit Court, although it's hard to know given how few nominations Obama has sent up. On legislation, it may be in the interests of all Senators to preserve the possibility of filibusters, but 60 on everything is bad for the Senate.<br /><br />But strictly within the limits of what reform was meant to do -- to make the 60 vote Senate work better -- I think the early returns are actually pretty good.
Read Stuff, You Should<----->Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0116483/">Bruce Kirby</a>, 85. Third-most-common Columbo occasional actor, despite not (unless I missed one) being a Cassavetes guy. Excellent, whether in sitcoms or cop shows.<br /><br />The good stuff:<br /><br />1. I rarely link to editorials, but I think the NYT gets <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/opinion/budget-cuts-minus-the-inconvenience.html?hp">points to something important here</a>. One of the real hallmarks of the current group of Republicans is passing policies and then blaming Barack Obama and the Democrats for them; it's unusually irresponsible, but they keep going back to it.<br /><br />2. Negative recruiting: very difficult to study. Reporters Greg Bluestein and Daniel Malloy look at <a href="http://www.myajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/fearing-another-bruising-primary-democrats-seek-to/nXS7q/">Democrats in Georgia who are trying to prevent a nasty primary</a>. <br /><br />3. And I'm glad now that I didn't get into last week's discussion of baseball salaries, since instead I can just send you to Robert Farley, who <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/04/the-reserve-clause-public-funding-and-social-cohesion">totally nails the subject</a>. I should say, by the way: getting rid of the reserve clause is a rare thing which should unite those of virtually all political views.
April 23, 1973<----->Nixon now decides: Haldeman and Ehrlichman should not take leaves of absence until everything is resolved; they should resign in order to fight any charges against them. That's the advice he's getting from pretty much everyone he consults; of course, what none of those people know that Nixon does know is how guilty they both are -- and how guilty he is.<br /><br /><a name="more"></a><br />Nixon has Ron Ziegler, the White House Press Secretary who is increasingly a close adviser during this period, call Haldeman late in the day to tell him. From Haldeman's diary:<br /><br />--<br /><br />He [Nixon] told Ziegler to call me and tell me that from the standpoint of the presidency, and from my own standpoint, I should consider seriously that the P has no alternative and that I should resign and fight this, as I know how to fight it.<br /><br />Ron said the separability idea was argued at length and the view is that it can't be separated. Ehrlichman and I both have to go. The P said these two men are strong enough to deal with this, to move on their own to make their case. But the presidency cannot be encumbered by it.<br /><br />--<br /><br />But after that long conversation, Haldeman talks to Ehrlichman, and then to their (shared) lawyer, and then back to Ziegler, where Haldeman argues for not doing anything quite yet.<br /><br />So another running theme: not just indecision, but an inability for them to confront each other when necessary. It's not clear how much it matters to the eventual outcomes, but it certainly is an interesting window into how this particular White House operated.<br /><br />At the end of the day, nothing is resolved, or at least nothing is acted on. It will have to wait until Nixon returns from Florida.
Elsewhere: Post-party, LBJ,<----->New Salon <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/04/23/gop_quits_public_policy/">column</a>: it turns out that of the ten low-numbered bills reserved for the party agenda, Republicans in the House have only used...one. They really aren't even trying to pretend they have an agenda, do they? And no, it's not a conservative/liberal thing: Republicans usually have no shortage of bills to highlight. It's this group.<br /><br />Over at PP, I'm <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/04/23/please-no-more-lbj-comparisons/">asking</a> for please no more LBJ comparisons. One reason? There's a good chance that Johnson's overbearing arm-twisting backfired in the long run.<br /><br />Yesterday, I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/04/22/on-immigration-boehner-will-do-what-mainstream-conservatives-want/">argued</a> that on immigration, the key players are House mainstream conservatives. John Boehner will ultimately do what they want. And yesterday at Greg's place, I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/04/22/yup-cutting-spending-means-you-have-to-cut-spending/">noted</a> that Republicans are still pushing the same old "cut spending, except on any program you name" talking points.
Max Baucus<----->Max Baucus announced today that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/us/politics/baucus-wont-seek-re-election-to-senate.html?hp">he's retiring after this Congress</a>.<br /><br />He's been, I'd say, a good Senator -- with the faults of good Senators. Senate Finance Committee Chairs, at least the modern ones, have tended to be deal-makers who cared more about getting things done than any particular substantive concerns, with Bob Dole being maybe the perfect example, along with Lloyd Bentsen and Baucus.<br /><br />Baucus infuriated liberals, mostly because, well, he wasn't one. They were wrong, in my view, in their attacks on him for attempting to get Republicans (or at least Olympia Snowe) on board for the ACA in 2009; while it was ultimately unsuccessful, it was hardly certain that it would be, and <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2011/09/endless-summer-2009-biggest-myth-of-aca.html">the delay was more myth than reality</a>.<br /><br />On the other hand, Baucus's choice to work with Republicans in passing massive tax cuts in 2001 was a real example of choosing getting things done over substance. That's the one that liberals should hold against him.<br /><br />Dealmakers are rarely beloved, other than by their constituents who enjoy the benefits, and perhaps by Congressional scholars (and hangers-on). And liberals are particularly upset with Baucus right now after his vote against Manchin-Toomey last week, a vote which evidently wasn't about electoral incentives unless he had a very late change of heart about running. But my general feeling is that the ACA should count on the plus side for Baucus, for liberals that is.<br /><br />All that said, if Democrats do hold the Senate, the man in line to be the next chair of Finance is the mainstream liberal that Baucus isn't. Ezra Klein has a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/23/ron-wyden-is-wonkish-optimistic-idiosyncratic-and-about-to-be-very-powerful/">good profile up on Ron Wyden</a> -- who is, as he says, more idiosyncratic than liberals probably want, but his instincts surely are basically liberal. Wyden isn't really in the Dole tradition; if you're looking for a comp, perhaps try Daniel Patrick Moynihan, minus the pretension, I suppose.<br /><br />At any rate, the high turnover in the Senate continues. Are there more shoes still to drop? It's still early in the cycle.
An Unusually Naive Slip From Wonkblog<----->Today's <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/23/wonkbook-reid-wants-to-call-republicans-budget-bluff/">Wonkbook</a> (from Evan Soltas and Ezra Klein) tells the story of the Republican reluctance to go to conference on the budget, and concludes:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">And Senate Democrats arent having it. After years of Republicans complaining about secret deals and hammering Senate Democrats for betraying regular order, theyre calling the GOPs bluff. Thats why Reid intends to move towards conference this morning. Either Republicans will agree, and regular order will proceed  which will likely mean no deal, and which will then give House Democrats a chance to throw their bombs  or Senate Republicans will filibuster, and that will be the end of the regular order talking point.</blockquote>My prediction: no, it won't be the end of that talking point. We'll still see Republicans claiming that Democrats are irresponsible on the budget because the Senate didn't pass a budget resolution for four years.<br /><br />And they'll make that point primarily in the Republican-aligned partisan press, where they'll rarely get any pushback on it. Remember, the "four years" of not passing a "budget" included the time after the Budget Control Act was passed, which in addition to being far more important than a budget resolution (the BCA was law; budget resolutions are not) actually did have the word "Budget" right there in the title. But that didn't stop the talking point, any more than some Republicans refrained from making those hilarious teleprompter jokes even when they were, themselves, reading those jokes off of a teleprompter.<br /><br />Generally, I continue to not be a big fan of the "if we do this then they won't be able to say that" line of reasoning. It can work, but usually? Not really. Especially in cases such as this in which we're talking about rhetoric that's mainly aimed at one's own strong supporters in order to give them something to feel aggrieved about.
Read Stuff, You Should<----->Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000933/">Valerie Bertinelli</a>, 53. Yes, of course I watch her retread show on TVLand, although I watch it the old fashioned way -- when I happen to see it when I'm flipping around the dial.

April 20, 1973<----->The fallout of the last round of revelations continues, while John Dean and the prosecutors continue their stalemate. It's still not entirely clear which way Dean will wind up going.<br /><br />The president, after meeting with Haldeman in the morning, leaves for the weekend for Florida, taking Ron Ziegler and Pat Buchanan with him but sending Haldeman and Ehrlichman to Camp David.<br /><br />Nixon continues to work closely, now, with Henry Petersen. Nixon is walking a fine line; Petersen, at this point, doesn't have any realization at all about Nixon's role in the cover-up; the president pumps him for information about the progress of the investigation, without raising any suspicions. The key for Nixon at this point, remember, is to try to keep Dean from testifying about his Oval Office conversations. Well, that, and keeping Haldeman and Ehrlichman (and I suppose Colson, although he's already gone from the White House so there's less an issue there) from turning on him. Especially if, as is very likely at this point, they are indicted. Their lawyers have convinced Nixon to keep them on for now, but they all seem to know by now that it's only a question of how it's to be done, not whether it's to be done. Indeed: Nixon intends to ask Ziegler and Buchanan, as well as his friend Bebe Rebozo, what to do, but it's pretty clear he knows.<br /><br />It's Good Friday. Nothing much changes the next two days, although Nixon has a phone conversation with Haldeman on Easter, going over the same material again. The newspapers and all of Washington are <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00610FC38551A7493C2AB178FD85F478785F9">buzzing</a> <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F0061FFC3E54137A93C0AB178FD85F478785F9">about</a> the <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00D14FC3E54137A93C0AB178FD85F478785F9">whole thing</a> -- what Dean will say, what Mitchell said to the grand jury, the fate of the president's two most important members of the White House staff. Even, now, the possibility that Nixon himself could have known more than he let on. <br /><br />
Monday Cranky Blogging 3<----->It's been a while since the New York Times Sunday crossword puzzle made me cranky, at least politically cranky...but, yup, yesterday's did the trick. It was 24 Across: "Tammany Hall corruption, e.g.?" The answer: "Evil from New York" (The question mark in the clue is pegged to the theme, which had to do with "flipped front" so that the answer was a riff on "Live from New York").<br /><br />"Evil"? Really? I suppose that to some extent it's justified, since it asks about Tammany Hall corruption, as opposed to Tammany Hall or machine politics in general. But, really, the crossword writer and editor can't think of a better example of New York evil?<br /><br />It's all Goo Goo nonsense, in my view. For the best understanding of "corruption," read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Plunkitt-Tammany-Hall-Practical-Politics/dp/0451526201">Plunkitt of Tammany Hall</a>. That's not to say there was no <i>dis</i>honest graft or other even worse behavior, but normal machine politics, including "honest" graft, is in my view probably a positive, but at any rate far from evil.<br /><br />Evil? Try a progressive politician...say, Woodrow Wilson.
Monday Cranky Blogging 2<----->Yes, yes, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/opinion/sunday/dowd-president-obama-is-no-bully-in-the-pulpit.html?smid=fb-share&amp;_r=3&amp;">Maureen Dowd,</a> but everyone already got there before me, pointing out that presidents cannot, in fact, wave a magic wand or say magic words or whatever and get Members of Congress to do anything they want.<br /><br />I'm not sure if have all of them, but: Seth Masket is <a href="http://mischiefsoffaction.blogspot.com/2013/04/everything-thats-wrong-with-american.html">excellent</a>. Kevin Drum made <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/04/maureen-dowd-and-presidential-leverage">some good points</a> (I'd quibble with him about party leaders vs. backbenchers, but he's right about the presidency). Jamelle Bouie is always <a href="http://prospect.org/article/obama-supporting-character">very good on this issue</a>. From a reporting point of view, Robert Costa makes the <a href="https://twitter.com/robertcostaNRO/status/326353118361165824">useful observation </a>that Obama was already doing the best thing he could have in order to get Republican votes. All very good, and makes anything I'd add at this point pretty superfluous.<br /><br />What I think needs some additional analysis, though, is this bit: "After the Newtown massacre, he and his aides hashed it out and decided he would look cold and unsympathetic if he didnt push for some new regulations."<br /><br />I think that's where any real analysis of this episode has to start, really. It's what Josh Kraushaar in his piece on how "Obama misread the politics of gun control," which centers, contra Dowd, on just how difficult it was going to be to pass anything, in large part because of the specific Senators who would be needed and their electoral incentives.<br /><br />The question remains, however: what should Obama have done? He could have, as he did after Gabby Giffords was shot, just said nice things in a speech, instead of asking a bunch of politicians for a very tough vote. But that would have had costs, too. See, not only does Obama not have the power to demand votes from Members of Congress, but he also doesn't have the power to shut up those who wanted a big push for a bill. And it would have been an extremely awkward position for Obama, to say the least, to appear indifferent to a bill moving through the Senate -- and I think it's certain that Dowd and others would have lit up Obama even worse if he had taken a fully hands-off position.<br /><br />The truth of this story is found somewhere in the middle, I should think. Those arguing that Obama had little influence are stretching, in my view: had Obama not taken the lead, I doubt a bill would have reached the floor of the Senate. The president was able to push for a legislative response, and my sense from the reporting is that he was able to strongly influence the nature of the response (expanded background checks, rather than an assault weapon ban or some other idea). He was part of the reason the bill got as far as it did. That partial success, in turn, may mean that there's a much better chance of passing something similar at some point in the future. That's not a bad several weeks worth of work, to tell the truth.<br /><br />Does that mean Obama made the right choice? It's very hard to judge these things, especially with limited information. But, as all of those linked at the top point out, assessing any of it depends, to begin with, on a realistic idea of what the president's options are, and what his influence is.
The Wrath of the Conquest of the Planet of the Bride of the Son of the Return of Cranky Blogging<----->It's not exactly about any one thing in particular, but just thinking about the horrific mistake that GOP governors made in 1999 to put some guy who had no real interest in government or public affairs into the Oval Office...well, it sure makes me cranky every time I think about it.<br /><br />Fine, I suppose there's more; there's a news peg to it. George W. Bush's presidential library is about to open, and so we're getting Bush stuff all over the press, such as <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/george-w-bush-s-reluctant-re-emergence-on-the-political-scene-20130422?page=1">this National Journal piece</a>&nbsp;on Bush's "Reluctant&nbsp;Re-Emergence on the Political Scene" with a subheadline that "these days he's more interested in painting, golfing, and enjoying time away from politics."<br /><br />Which makes me cranky because as far as I can see, he was <i>always</i> more interested in golf, baseball, and pretty much everything except the world of public affairs.<br /><br />Oh, I think he enjoyed the game of electoral politics (is it too mean to say that he enjoyed it especially when he was winning? Perhaps). As Richard Ben Cramer taught us, the Bush family is nothing if not competitive. But beyond that? I find it very, very, easy to imagine that he paid little attention to public affairs either before or after his political career.<br /><br />And I think that's highly unusual for politicians, and pretty much unheard of for presidents. Granted, it's not as if they're all Bill Clinton, who seems to be almost pathological in his obsession about policy, by all accounts (then, too, Clinton seems pathological in so many obsessions). Plenty of politicians appear to be highly interested in one realm of public affairs but relatively indifferent to others. And certainly many are drawn to politics as a career mainly because they love the power that it gives them, or because they like the attention, or whatever. But there's normally a reason that they become politicians and not, I don't know, rock stars.<br /><br />That's even true for most dynastic politicians; they may have gone into the family business simply because it was the family business, but most of them absorbed interest in the world along with their choice of career. I'm not much of a fan of JFK or Al Gore, but I don't think anyone would accuse either of them, or George H.W. Bush for that matter, of having little interest in the world of public affairs. There are some politicians who seem to be far more interested in the processes of policy-making than the outcomes...I get the sense that Bob Dole was like that, for example, and I think a lot of Congressional leaders have been like that to a greater or lesser extent. But for them, mastery of process makes mastery of substance necessary, so it doesn't much matter.<br /><br />If I'm right about Bush -- and, to be fair, it's possible we'll learn more in the future that will prove me wrong, although I doubt it -- then I can't think of anyone at a high level of politics even remotely comparable. All of which made him ill-equipped to cope with the presidency. All presidents have to deal with insufficient knowledge about public policy; Bush had far less, on far more topics, than most. And he had fewer successful (or, to be blunt, sober) life experiences to fall back on.<br /><br />Anyway, my guess is that Bush's reputation will wind up if anything worse, not better, than his current reputation. Why? Because I suspect that when we get more information, we'll see more instances where he was indifferent, uninvolved, unprepared, easily manipulated, and generally not up for the job and not particularly interested in doing anything about it. In other words, I'm guessing that the worst stereotypes of him as president will turn out to be true -- and that his reputation, currently hurt by outcomes, will stay lousy or get worse as we learn more about process. Note: I twice there said "guess," and I mean it; I could be wrong! But I've yet to see any evidence that pushed me the other way.<br /><br />Dan Drezner, while <a href="http://drezner.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/04/22/meet_the_revisionist_george_w_bush_pretty_much_the_same_as_the_old_george_w_bush">hardly defending Bush</a>, thinks that there is some reason to believe his reputation will improve. Drezner says that Bush has been a good ex-president...but he's been "good" more in the sense of Gerald Ford (staying out of the way) rather than a Jimmy Carter, doing good works. I sort of expect that Bush will wind up doing good works the way that his father has, eventually, but he certainly isn't going to be a Carter or a Clinton. Nor will he, obviously, spend his retirement writing books about important issues, the way that Nixon did.<br /><br />Drezner also thinks Bush will accrue "credit" because of what came after him, at least when it comes to Republicans and foreign policy/national security. I disagree! I think that Bush will -- properly -- be seen as responsible for that poor quality. After all, most of it comes from Bush's administration promoting people who are now responsible for much of that poor quality, and discrediting or undermining those who were more sound on those issues. Going back to the previous paragraph -- Bush deserves some blame for this post-presidency, too. It's true, and as Drezner said to Bush's credit, that in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks Bush worked against "anti-Muslim hysteria." But it was Bush Administration veterans who encouraged that sort of thing during the Obama years, and George W. Bush sat by and did nothing, when it's quite possible he could have made a difference.<br /><br />And then Drezner gives Bush, or at least his economic team, credit for their actions in fall 2008. I don't know...I think it's more likely that historians will focus more on inaction leading into the economic disaster (or policies which actively brought it on) rather than policies which avoided even worse outcomes. In that sense, it's much like the Bush Iraq policy in his last two years in office; whatever good marks he gets for changing course, it's all in the context of rescuing a self-made disaster.<br /><br />A have to mention this somewhere...there's torture. I mean, first of all, that Bush's administration adopted torture as policy. Even if we want to give a very generous reading of things, it's still a terrible mark against him. And again: I do think that Bush is the one person capable of preventing the Republican Party from becoming the pro-torture party, or at least of dramatically changing the odds of it happening, and he hasn't done it. On top of that, there's the civil liberties record...yes, all presidents (Madison excepted) do poorly on that during wartime, and on civil liberties it's hard to say that Bush was the worst, but still he was pretty awful, and that's apt to look bad to future historians.<br /><br />Despite all this, we're already seeing and are sure to see revisionist stuff about Bush, most of it perfectly <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/george-w-bush-is-victim-of-rush-to-judgment/2013/04/19/fe7e0d14-a136-11e2-82bc-511538ae90a4_print.html">evidence-free</a>.<br /><br />The whole thing is enough to make me very, very cranky.
Read Stuff, You Should<----->Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098627/">Catherine Mary Stewart</a>, 54.<br /><br />And here's some good stuff:<br /><br />1. The number one justified conservative complaint about the press: how "conservative" and "right-wing" are used interchangably for both folks like Ronald Reagan and Mitt Romney, on the one hand, and Hitler, on the other. During the tail end of the Soviet Union, the faction which wanted to keep communism as it was regularly was referred to as, yes, conservative. Philip Klein was <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/why-coverage-of-right-wing-violence-irritates-conservatives/article/2527693">annoyed by it on Friday.</a><br /><br />2. Emily Bazelon <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/04/dzhokhar_tsarnaev_and_miranda_rights_the_public_safety_exception_and_terrorism.html">on Miranda</a>.<br /><br />3. Good journalism: <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/why-would-anyone-want-to-run-for-congress-20130418?page=1">excellent look at House and Senate recruiting</a>, from Shane Goldmacher.<br /><br />4. <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/2013/04/21/why-do-gun-rights-advocates-have-more-political-firepower-intensity-or-efficacy-and-social-networks/">If you want to know why gun measures keep losing</a> despite polling that shows their popularity, you definitely want to read David Karol.<br /><br />5. And I was hoping to get to this on Friday, but I'll just link instead: Travis Waldron is correct <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2013/04/17/1867721/rising-baseball-salaries-dont-show-us-everything-wrong-with-americas-financial-system/">about baseball salaries</a>. The proper liberal response to the rise in baseball salaries after 1975 should be, it seems to me, that business can thrive when the workers thrive (while the proper conservative response should be: hey, markets are really powerful and in many circumstances do an excellent job).
April 19, 1973<----->With the big Washington Post story out in the morning, much of the day is consumed, again, with whether Haldeman and Ehrlichman will stay or go.<br /><br /><a name="more"></a>The president meets again with Petersen, with the main topic Nixon trying to push hard on "national security" for the Fielding break-in and any other Plumbers material Petersen shouldn't get in to. Nixon's line to Petersen is that "Nothing in terms of break-ins or anything was approved" but that the Fielding break-in nevertheless is completely justified on national security grounds -- Nixon says he would have approved it.<br /><br />In their general conversation about it, Nixon finally gets to mention the alleged LBJ bugging of Nixon's 1968 campaign plane. This does not shut down the investigation into Watergate.<br /><br />But for now, Petersen goes along with Nixon's instructions, and passes it along to Silbert, the prosecutor.<br /><br />And word comes late in the day that there's another Washington Post blockbuster coming in the morning that will say Haldeman engineered the entire cover-up. There's a parallel process going on: there's the part of it involving the prosecutors and the grand jury, which takes place more or less in secret; and then there's also everyone's attempt to fight it out in the newspapers. Magruder, Dean, the White House -- everyone is trying to get material public in a way that makes themselves look good. And given how much guilt there is and how widely it's spread around, it's fairly easy for any of the key players to leak out wrongdoing by others and be completely -- or at least mostly -- accurate.<br /><br />Here's <a href="http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/trial/exhibit_29.pdf">one taste</a> of how things seem within the White House at this point -- a piece of a conversation late that morning between Ehrlichman and Nixon. In particular, Nixon's first speech here is...well, pretty amazing.<br /><br />--<br /><br /><br />PRESIDENT: Now let me put, put one other question to you right. Very painful, I know it's very painful for you to think of this, and it is for me too, but anyway, but, uhh, I think it would be helpful if you had this<br />consideration when you talk the rest of the day, this and that, bother you the rest of the day I hope. I think the separation problem has to be considered. I want you to look at it very coldly, not in terms of Bob, in terms of the President, the needs that we have and have had, and an atmosphere, Mr. So and So, look at this thing, in terms of your, about how you're involved in terms of whether it's going to be bad, and what, how you are involved, what Dean may say. Don't know what the son-of-a-bitch is going to say. I don't know what you do with the Dean (unintelligible) he's obviously very upset. He's just lashing out. Goddammit, I don't know what we've been told. I just don't know, John. Frankly, I'm at a loss. We were all talking frankly, that's why the counsel was sworn.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Well, as I said...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: That goddamn Dean.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: As I said this morning, I think you can very truthfully and logically and properly say that ...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: I was trying to bury, I was trying, I was really trying to probe his thought processes. I went down every road we possibly could...<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Exactly right.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: ...and see where we were.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: And it paid off. You see, you're the one who then came back and said, "I've go to have that all written down. Send that man to Camp David if necessary and have him take as much time as necessary and let's get it all down." That's when he was uncovered.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: I suppose that really isn't true.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Well...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Not that he was uncovered, it was simply the fact that he said, "By God, this thing is such a cancer and so forth, that I can't write it and there's no way we make a statement," and I said to you, John, "You better get into it." Take...<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Yes, but I happen to be...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Well...<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: This may be some measure of hindsight, but I really don't think it is because my very<br />conscious contemporary reaction when Dean came back and didn't have anything for us, was, whoops, there's something more here, because Dean could have constructed some kind of an artful ah, ah, evasion if he hadn't been so pervasively involved.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible)<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: For the, for the campaign committee or the White House, or whoever he wanted to protect, but, uhh, the thing that occurred to me when, when Bob told me what Dean said that he couldn't, he couldn't write it. I just had a mental image of the guy sitting there with big piles of paper saying, "I've just written a confession, and I would be nuts to deliver this to anybody."<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Well, that's what we have to say.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Well, I think, I think that's very very probable.<br />
Sunday Question for Liberals<----->I'll go with the same question: just in terms of electoral politics, what's the best outcome for the Democratic Party on immigration?
Sunday Question for Conservatives<----->Just in terms of electoral interests, what is the best outcome for the Republican Party on immigration?
April 18, 1973<----->"The P had me in at 8:00 this morning. Said that if this thing goes the way it might, and I have to leave, he wants me to take all the office material from his -- ah -- machinery there and hold it for the library."<br /><br /><a name="more"></a>That's Haldeman's diary, from April 18. The cover-up of the cover-up is fully underway here, and one of the first things to do is to secure the evidence. And as Nixon knows, the White House tapes are evidence that will convict all of them, himself certainly included.<br /><br />Henry Petersen was busy that day. Dean had mentioned the Fielding break-in a few days ago, and by now it's worked its way up to Petersen. Is it true? Daniel Ellsberg is still on trial in Los Angeles, and Petersen, following procedure, checks with the prosecutors there whether they know anything about it. Then a check through the FBI files, and then, finally, they figure it out -- the photos of Liddy and Hunt, in disguise, outside Fielding's office, the photos that Richard Helms had sent to Justice when he left the CIA.<br /><br />At the White House, the day was spent, basically, fencing with Dean (who was upset about things in the newspapers he thought the White House had planted to hit him, which sent Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Nixon scrambling to have Ron Ziegler deflate that particular flare-up).<br /><br />Nixon then had Haldeman and Ehrlichman up to Camp David for the night. While there, they learn that the Washington Post is running a big Woodward and Bernstein story the next day detailing Magruder's story. And then Petersen reports to Nixon that Dean has told them about the Fielding break-in. Here's (via Emery) Petersen's version of the call:<br /><br />"[...] I dropped the next bombshell. It was that Dean had informed Silbert that Liddy and Hunt and company had burglarized Dr. Fielding's office, who was Ellsberg's psychiatrist. The president said, 'I know about that. That's a national security matter. Your mandate is Watergate. You stay out of that.'"<br /><br />Ehrlichman reports the Nixon's comments after he gets off the phone: "That should keep them out of it. There is no reason for them to get into it. What those fellows did was no crime; they ought to get a medal for going after Ellsberg."<br /><br />All very well, but it's going to take more than some presidential anger to hold the line on just Watergate. Especially since it is a bit difficult to see exactly how harassing Ellsberg is heroic, whatever once thinks of his actions in (illegally) leaking the Pentagon Papers.<br /><br />Over dinner at Camp David, Nixon turns the conversation, again, to whether Haldeman and Ehrlichman should leave the White House. Back to Haldeman's diary to end the day:<br /><br />--<br /><br />The P keeps saying during this that he hasn't decided. But he went through quite a thing in an emotional way about how Ehrlichman and I would always have the use of Camp David regardless of what happens, for the next three and a half years, and that he wasn't emotional, but he really is and that this was a terribly painful thing and so on and so on. I think it really was, and it is, hard for him, but it's also conterproductive for us. I mean the time going around and around on the same ground with him, when we should be developing our own case for our interest and his. It was clear, though, that his feeling was that there was no real way out, except for us to pull out and fight rather than trying to stay.
What Mattered This Week?<----->Ugh. What didn't matter this week?<br /><br />I suppose a lot of this is in the we-don't-know-yet category. Of course, the events in Boston and in Texas certainly mattered to the people involved. Whether they matter beyond that...well, we'll be getting tighter security at sports events for a long while, at least. But we're yet to know any larger importance for the marathon bombings.<br /><br />As for the Texas explosion, was it a sign of lax regulation and more to come unless there are changes? Or was it a freak event?<br /><br />And then there was everything else that happened this week. To tell the truth, I'm still catching up, so I don't even know much about anything that wasn't in the headlines or in my particular radar.<br /><br />So I'll leave it all to you. What do you think mattered this week?
April 17, 1973<----->Today was another major Watergate day. This time super-major.<br /><br /><a name="more"></a><br />--<br /><br />That's how Bob Haldeman begins his diary entry for Tuesday, April 17, the day that Richard Nixon publicly launched the cover-up of the cover-up. Haldeman's note early in the day:<br /><br />--<br /><br />Dean is the one who surprises and to some extent disappoints him [Nixon]. I found the latter rather shocking, &nbsp;considering that Dean has turned total traitor, and he shouldn't be surprised and disappointed. He should be shocked and furious.<br /><br />--<br /><br />The question for them now is whether to work to get immunity for Dean or not. Colson calls to urge Nixon to intervene and prevent it, and Haldeman and Ehrlichman's interests are there, too. Immunity isn't going to come without testimony, and there's not way, at this point, that any of Nixon's closest aides survive that without at least indictments.<br /><br />But here their interests are not necessarily the same as Nixon's, because Dean has threatened Nixon only in the context of a trial. Immunity could mean that Dean doesn't volunteer anything about his conversations with the president -- indeed, he's told Nixon that he hasn't so far, and while Nixon can't trust him there's at least some hope of it. On the other hand, Nixon hardly wants to create any divisions between himself and Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Colson -- since all of them have far more on him than Dean does.<br /><br />After two meetings for Nixon, Haldeman, and Ehrlichman, and after Nixon met with the Italian Prime Minister, the president then decided to finally make his press statement.<br /><br />The first part was an announcement that he would, after all, allow his staff to testify for the Senate Watergate Committee, although he said he was reserving the right to have them decline to answer any question on the grounds of executive privilege. And then he's not able to say he's solved the case, so instead:<br /><br />--<br /><br /><br />My second announcement concerns the Watergate case directly.<br /><br />On March 21, as a result of serious charges which came to my attention, some of which were publicly reported, I began intensive new inquiries into this whole matter.<br /><br />Last Sunday afternoon, the Attorney General, Assistant Attorney General Petersen, and I met at length in the EOB to review the facts which had come to me in my investigation and also to review the progress of the Department of Justice investigation.<br /><br />I can report today that there have been major developments in the case concerning which it would be improper to be more specific now, except to say that real progress has been made in finding the truth.<br /><br />If any person in the executive branch or in the Government is indicted by the grand jury, my policy will be to immediately suspend him. If he is convicted, he will, of course, be automatically discharged.<br /><br />I have expressed to the appropriate authorities my view that no individual holding, in the past or at present, a position of major importance in the Administration should be given immunity from prosecution.<br /><br />The judicial process is moving ahead as it should, and I shall aid it in all appropriate ways and have so informed the appropriate authorities.<br /><br />As I have said before and I have said throughout this entire matter, all Government employees and especially White House Staff employees are expected fully to cooperate in this matter. I condemn any attempts to cover up in this case, no matter who is involved.<br /><br />--<br /><br />It's <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F50C17FC38551A7493CAA8178FD85F478785F9">front-page news</a>. And it's helped along by press secretary Ron Ziegler's comment, after Nixon is done. Ziegler gave a rehearsed answer to a question about Nixon's comments, saying that it was "the operative statement." When then asked the obvious follow-up, Ziegler affirmed that everything he and the president had said before this was "<a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10E14FC38551A7493CAA8178FD85F478785F9">inoperative</a>."<br /><br />As a press event, it was mostly a disaster. But it served Nixon's purposes. First, it put pressure on both Dean and the prosecutors, who now pressed Dean to plead guilty to some charges. Total immunity wasn't coming. And it put down Nixon's first marker on the cover-up to the cover-up: the story that he had only learned over any of it, from John Dean, on March 21.<br /><br />The pressure was building on Nixon, though, for one thing: to remove his two top staff assistants. Henry Peterson, in an afternoon meeting, argued strongly for ridding himself of them. What Peterson doesn't realize, however, is that they haven't betrayed the president; they've worked closely with him. But Dean hasn't talked yet about Nixon, and even Dean doesn't have any idea at all how well-informed and active Nixon has been of the cover-up from the start. Rogers, too, thought that they should resign, as had incoming WH Counsel Garment.<br /><br />Nixon hasn't made that decision yet -- or at least, hasn't really made it yet. But the writing is on the wall. Part of Nixon's case against removing them is that all there is yet are rumors and accusations, and he should hang tough against that, but he must know by now that indictments are inevitable. And now he mentions to them that Bebe Rebozo will raise money for their legal fees, and that if they did leave he intends to have them set up and then run his post-presidential foundation.<br /><br />Nixon certainly does know where he's vulnerable to Dean, though -- all day long, he runs past Haldeman the question of the hush money/"blackmail" for Hunt, the million dollars that Dean told him about. Nixon still isn't honest about it with his chief of staff, but he's clearly upset about it, and keeps circling back to it.<br /><br />At the end of the day, past midnight, Nixon and Haldeman talk on the phone again. And Haldeman ends his notes for the day still wondering why Mitchell didn't step up and take the blame.
Elsewhere<----->It's basically a rerun, but over at PP today I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/04/19/the-patriotism-of-a-political-response/">argued</a> that, yes, political responses to things such as the Boston bombings are not only justified, but actually quite patriotic.<br /><br />Yesterday, I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/04/18/on-budget-procedure-the-new-gop-position-is-the-right-one/">poked</a> at Boehner a bit, saying that his current position on budget procedures is the correct one.<br /><br />And earlier, I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/04/17/strong-background-checks-go-down-this-time/">reacted</a> to the demise of the gun bill and talked about what comes next, and had a companion <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/04/17/the-gun-bill-and-the-future-of-filibuster-reform/">piece</a> on how the gun fight might (or might not) lead to Senate reform.<br /><br />That's it for now. With any luck, I'll have a baseball post later, and there's plenty more Watergate to come. I don't know about you all, but I'll be happy to get my focus onto baseball over the weekend.
Once More on "Is It a Filibuster?" (Hint: It Is)<----->This one might be a little redundant at this point, but everyone is pretty much focused on the manhunt in Boston right now, and I have nothing to say about that, so I might as well continue filibuster blogging. And besides, maybe this is still necessary -- because Kevin Drum is a smart guy, and if he's still a bit confused on this point, maybe lots of people are.<div><br /></div><div>So this comes from a <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/04/did-gun-legislation-fail-because-filibuster">post Drum wrote last night</a> in which he said that the press should call what happened to Manchin-Toomey a filibuster, even though "Technically, however, it's not a filibuster, so reporting it as one isn't precisely correct."</div><div><br /></div><div>This made your plain blogger quite cranky. I took to twitter to fight it out, but Boston was exploding right then and it was late anyway, so I sort of cut it short. No fancy storify stuff here; I'm going to quote him and paraphrase myself, and then conclude what I would have said to conclude it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Me: Yes, it is a filibuster.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Drum: "I agree we should call it that, but technically a UC just isn't a filibuster. It's a UC done under threat of a filibuster."</div><div><br /></div><div>Me: No, that's not it. here's the sequence:</div><div><br /></div><div>1. There's a filibuster&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>2. The two sides then decide how to settle the filibuster.The 60-vote threshold UC is an agreement on how to settle the filibuster. Not by waiting it out, not by a cloture vote, but by a 60-threshold vote</div><div><br /></div><div>3.&nbsp;And then the vote itself both resolves the filibuster and resolves the issue. Under 60, the amendment is defeated by filibuster; over 60, it overcomes the filibuster, and also passes the amendment, all in one.</div><div><br /></div><div>Drum: "At what point is the filibuster formally declared?"</div><div><br /></div><div>[End of twitter; this is me, now]</div><div><br /></div><div>Me: I have three answers to that one!</div><div><br /></div><div>(1) Wiseass answer: when Mitch McConnell said on Election Day in 2008 that it was a 60 vote Senate.</div><div><br /></div><div>(2) Practical answer: Mitch McConnell has in fact insisted on 60 votes for practically everything beginning in January 2009. He does not always insist on a cloture vote; sometimes they negotiate another resolution, including no separate procedure at all on some things that clearly have far more than 60. But almost nothing, and certainly nothing of importance, passes without 60. That's a filibuster.</div><div><br /></div><div>(3) Additional answer: It's unlikely that McConnell has to spell it out at this point, but surely if Harry Reid asked him (or whoever; it could have been negotiated by the bill handlers and opponents) whether they could just use regular order and proceed to a simple-majority vote on Manchin-Toomey, Reid was told they couldn't.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>More generally: "formally"? Filibusters don't have to be formally declared. Indeed, sometimes in the old days it wouldn't be certain that a speech or a never-ending series of amendments was really a filibuster-to-kill, as opposed to a filibuster-to-delay, or just a really long-winded Senator. It's even possible that the filibustering Senator(s) hadn't really figured it out yet. It made counting filibusters really hard! (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Filibustering-Political-Obstruction-American-Politics/dp/0226449653">Read Greg Koger</a> if you want more on that).&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>But that's not necessary now. Republicans have declared a 60 vote Senate. They are demanding 60 votes to pass any bill, any amendment, any nomination, anything. That's a filibuster on everything. Technically and all.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I think -- and I'm not just talking about one post here, but generally -- part of the confusion is caused by conflating three things: whether there is a filibuster; how the filibuster is conducted; and how the filibuster is resolved. How it is conducted and how it is resolved are both determined by the tactics of both sides, and sometimes by agreement between both sides. Again, it could be resolved by forcing Senators to talk and seeing whether they would keep going or not (attrition); it could be resolved by a cloture vote; it can be resolved by informally agreeing whether or not there are 60 votes and then moving ahead if there are and pulling the bill/amendment/nomination if there are not; and it can be resolved through this 60 vote threshold thing. And it can be conducted by Senators standing on the Senate floor and talking, or, under current norms, by Senators informing leadership or bill managers that they'll insist on 60.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>But it is wrong to say that insisting on 60 is threatening a filibuster. The demand is the filibuster, under the conditions -- which hold now, and have held for decades -- that the way a filibuster is conducted is by notifying people of the demand for 60.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>And so, whenever 60 is demanded, and however that is resolved, the press should report that a measure has been filibustered, and if it fails -- again, however it is resolved -- they should report that it has been defeated by filibuster.&nbsp;</div>

April 16, 1973<----->As Haldeman says, "Another all-Watergate day, as they generally tend to be now."<br /><br /><a name="more"></a><br />Two things are going on, really. First is that the collapse of the cover-up is continuing. Haldeman and Ehrlichman are each still trying to save themselves, and Nixon too is still hoping that somehow the CRP backup coverup can be saved, presumably be keeping Dean and Magruder from reaching final deals with Justice. But at the same time, the president is putting together a new cover-up -- the cover-up of the cover-up. For that, Nixon is willing to sacrifice everyone in order to save himself and his presidency. Or, if one looks at it more generously, it's too late to save any of the people involved except for himself, and that's what he's going to turn to.<br /><br />First, in the morning, <a href="http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/trial/exhibit_24.pdf">Nixon meets with Haldeman and Ehrlichman</a>. The cover-up of the cover-up proceeds:<br /><br />--<br /><br /><br />PRESIDENT: &nbsp;[...] I would like also a scenario evolved with regard to, uh, the President's role, in other w words, when the President began to find out about this, what he did, I think it's a pretty good role John, I'm, I'm not sure of it. It's as good as I can guess because remember I got Dean in, first I said I wanted him to report, sent him to Camp David. He came back and said he couldn't and I want to ask him about that today, and then you, and I'd like you to give Steve your report and everything you did -- see what I mean. Also, then, third, there is the PR thing, as to, when we, when we disclosed that and how.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: [Press Secretary Ron] Ziegler has just left my office. He feels we have no more than twelve hours.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Right.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Uh, he, he's got some, uh, input from the Post and uh, it's his estimate that unless we take the initiative by nine o'clock tonight,<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Uh hum. ~<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: uh, it will be too late. Now, for that reason, I would suggest that Ziegler sit in a meeting with Petersen and that you and Ziegler persuade Petersen that the announcement has to come from the White House.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: I'll tell him.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Uh, otherwise the Justice Department will, of course, try and<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Uh, huh.<br />EHRLICHMAN pre-empt this while thing.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Yeah.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: But I think it would be a good idea for you to spend, uh,...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: I don't -- I think, I think I've got to get Petersen in alone first.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Sure, sure, I understand.<br /><br />HALDEMAN: (Unintelligible)<br /><br />PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible) then I'll pull Ziegler in<br /><br />HALDEMAN: Yeah.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Uh.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: That's a very good point.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Now, you may want to listen to Ron for some time ahead of time. He's got this well thought through and, and well laid out, and I think he's quite dispassionate about it, quite, quite, uh...<br /><br />HALDEMAN: Well, we'11 go over that with him.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Yeah, we'll do that now while you're gone.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br /><br />PRESIDENT: How's Ron think it ought to be done? I should do it.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Uh, Ron thinks that it ought to be done from here, uh, that uh... well, he hasn't said whether you should do it. Uh, I mentioned it to him the other day that you thought you should do it here in the Press room, if you did it at all.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: I could do it right here in the Oval Office.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Yes, uh, but he, he wants to get out the fact that uh, Dean disserved you, that the Dean report was inadequate, it didn't go far enough, that, uh, several weeks ago, uh, you reinstituted uh, uh, an examination of the...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: I began my personal investigation of the case.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Yeah, and that this culminated in a whole series of actions<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Right.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: over the weekend.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Personal investigation of the case in that I spent the weekend working on it. I think that's what we've got to say. The Dean rep, report, did not, did not, uh...<br /><br />HALDEMAN: That this is the week of Mitchell being here Saturday is very important to the circumstances.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: That's right. But uh, the President asked Ehrlichman to conduct his own investigation.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Well, now, if I'm going to be, if I'm going to be splashed on this thing, you're better off not having another discredited Dean.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Yeah, well, somebody's got to do it.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Well, you can downplay who did it.<br /><br />HALDEMAN: You can say you did it yourself by talking to all the people...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Yeah.<br /><br />HALDEMAN: ...concerned.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Yeah.<br /><br />HALDEMAN: You talked to me and Ehrlichman and everybody else...<br /><br />SEVERAL VOICES: (Unintelligible)<br /><br />PRESIDENT: I, I made my own investigation of the matter.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: I think that's that's the way.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: My own investigation of the matter. But I didn't talk to Mitchell, see.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Well, they say who did and you delegated me to do that. I mean that's, that's -- but, uh, ...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible) Ehrlichman (unintelligible)-- look you're splash though is only on this one God damn thing.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Well, I think there's a, there's a judgment call here, ...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Yeah.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: ...as to whether you want the quote Ehrlichman report unquote...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Yeah.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: ...out in the, in the media.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Yeah.<br /><br />HALDEMAN: (unintelligible) because they'll make a big thing about the Dean report...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Right.<br /><br />HALDEMAN: ...found out that Dean was guilty and the Ehrlichman report found out that Ehrlichman...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Right. No, no.<br /><br /><br />--<br /><br />The also get into what Dean has on Nixon; Nixon focuses on the March 21 discussion of money for Hunt as the key thing that Dean could use. And then they shift to ways they can blame Dean for the cover-up in the first place. Nixon brings them back to "his" investigation:<br /><br />--<br /><br /><br />PRESIDENT: [...] Well, anyway, uh we'll get there (unintelligible) Henry Petersen (unintelligible) This scenario (unintelligible) got to be so (unintelligible)<br /><br />SEVERAL VOICES: (Unintelligible)<br /><br />UNIDENTIFIED: Yes, sir.<br /><br />HALDEMAN: You bet.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: And, ah...<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Ron's got to have that information.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Well, I may have to just say it myself.<br /><br />HALDEMAN: Yeah.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: I conducted this<br /><br />UNIDENTIFIED: Right.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: ...investigation and so forth.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN (Unintelligible) Petersen standing there right by (unintelligible)<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Right, I can say that the Watergate case has been broken.<br /><br /><br />--<br /><br />At that point, they break, because <a href="http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/trial/exhibit_25.pdf">John Dean has been summoned to see the president</a>. Nixon wants to get him to sign a letter of resignation, but Dean won't do it unless Haldeman and Ehrlichman do too. More importantly, though, Nixon tries to clear himself, knowing the tape is running:<br /><br />--<br /><br /><br />PRESIDENT: &nbsp;[...] Let me, let me, let me summarize this specific point again, because I need to, uh, you know, they, we know there was no--on the Dean report. Ziegler has always said it was oral.<br /><br />DEAN: That's right.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Right. But you remember when you came in, I asked You the specific question: "Is anybody<br />on the White House Staff involved?" You told me "No".<br /><br />DEAN: That's right. And I have no knowledge...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: You still believe that?<br /><br />DEAN: Yes, sir, I do.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Yeah. But you did tell me that in the aftermath there were serious problems.<br /><br />DEAN: That's right.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Right. And, I said, "Well, let's see what they are." Right?<br /><br />DEAN: And now you're beginning to see what they are. They're potential, technical, obstruction of justice problems.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Sure. But not necessarily.<br /><br />DEAN: (Unintelligible)<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Well, I talked to Petersen last night and he made exactly the same point. He says the obstruction was morally wrong. No, not morally. He said, it may not have been morally wrong, and it may not be legally wrong, but he said from the standpoint of the Presidency, you can't have it. That's what his point was. So he, he seems to think that this, uh, that the obstruction of justice thing is a God-damn hard thing to prove<br /><br />DEAN: That's right.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: ...to prove in court, which I, I think should be some comfort to you.<br /><br />DEAN: Well, my lawyer tells me that, you know, "Legally, you're in, you're in damn good shape."<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Is that right?<br /><br />DEAN: That's right.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Because, uh, you're not...<br /><br />DEAN: That's right. It's, it's a<br />PRESIDENT: You were simply helping the defendants get their fees and their...<br /><br />DEAN: Well...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Huh? What does he say?<br /><br />DEAN: In that, in that position. I'm merely a conduit. Uh, it's very technical, very technical. I am a conduit to other people. That is the problem.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Uh huh. What was the situation, John? This--The only time I ever heard any<br />discussion of, uh, this supporting of the defendants--and I must say I, I guess I should have assumed somebody was helping them, I must have assumed it, but, uh, and, and I must say people were good in a way, I, I was busy--as when you mentioned to me some, something, about the, I mean. I think the last time we talked about Hal, uh, Hunt having a problem.<br /><br />DEAN: Well...<br /><br />PRESIDENT': Put that and that was, then we, but that was handled at, by Mitchell. Was that true or what the hell happened?<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[Dean talks about how he learned of the hush money, but Nixon wants to prove that March 21 was innocent and drags him back there]<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Let me tell you. What did you report to me on it, though? I--It was rather fragmentary, as I recall it . You said,<br /><br /><br />DEAN: Right.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: "Hunt had a problem, and, uh...<br /><br />DEAN: Very fragmentary . I was, I...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Yeah, but that's not the thing. I, I said, "What, what--John, what's it going to cost to do this?" Uh, that's when I sent you to Camp--and said, "Well, for God's sake, let's see where this thing comes out.<br /><br />DEAN: That's right.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: And you said it'd cost a million dollars.<br /><br />DEAN: I said, "It," you know, it conceivably could, and the way this," I said, "If we don't cut this thing..."<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Exactly.<br /><br />DEAN: Uh, anyway...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: But that's the only conversation we had. Where--How was that handled? Who the hell<br />handled that, that money?<br /><br />DEAN: Uh, well, let me tell you the rest--what, what Hunt said. He said, "You tell Dean that I need seventy-two thousand dollars for my personal expenses, fifty thousand dollars for my legal fees."<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Uh huh.<br /><br />DEAN: "If I don't get it, I'm going to have some things to say about the seamy things I did at the White House for John Ehrlichman."<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Uh huh.<br /><br />DEAN: All right. I took that to Ehrlichman. Ehrlichman said, uh, "Have you talked to Mitchell about it?" I said, "No, I have not." Uh, he said, "Well, will you talk to Mitchell?" I said, "Yes, I will." I talked to Mitchell. I just passed it along to him. And then there was a meeting dozen here a few days later in, in Bob's office with Bob and Ehrlichman and Mitchell and myself. And, uh, Ehrlichman said at that time. He said, "Well is that problem with Hunt straightened out?" He said it to me and I said, "Well, ask the man who may know:<br />Mitchell." And Mitchell said, "I think that problem is solved."<br /><div><br /></div><br />[...]<br /><br /><br />DEAN: [...] But the, the one report where I finally--I called Bob...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: (unintelligible) this office, Good.<br /><br />DEAN: Yeah. I called Bob and I said. I said, "Bob", I said. "I don't think the President has all the facts.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: That's right. And then you came and sat in this chair and that's the first time that I realized the thing.<br /><br />DEAN: That's right.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: And what--And nor the question is: "Well, Mr. Dean, why didn't you tell the President before?" And your answer there is<br /><br />DEAN: I didn't know. That is absolutely correct.<br /><br /><br />--<br /><br />Dean leaves, and Nixon reports to Haldeman and Ehrlichman what he learned. <a href="http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/trial/exhibit_26.pdf">They return to the "scenario."</a><br /><br />--<br /><br /><br />PRESIDENT: Good, good. (Unintelligible) how does the scenario work out may I ask? Is there something that you...<br /><br />HALDEMAN: Well, it works out very good. We had that, that, uh, you became aware sometime ago that<br />this thing did, did not parse out the way it was supposed to and that there were some discrepancies between what you had been told by Dean in the report that there was nobody in the White House involved, which may still be true.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Let me say that, I don't want to...I don't think it, it is gaining us anything by pissing on the Dean Report as such.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: No.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: What I mean is I would say that I was not satisfied that the Dean Report was, was complete, uh, and I also, I felt that I ought to, I ought to go--it was my obligation to go beyond that to people other<br />than the White House.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Well, Ron has an interesting point. Remember you had John Dean go to Camp David...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: I know...<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: ...and write it up, and he came down and said, "I can't."<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Right.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: That's the tip off and right then you started to move.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: That's right. He said he could not, could not write it.<br /><br />HALDEMAN: Then you realized there was, there was more to this...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Right.<br /><br />HALDEMAN: ...then you had been led to believe. (Unintelligible)<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Then how do I get credit for getting Magruder to the stand?<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Well, I, uh, it is very simple. You took Dean off the case right then--two weeks ago...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: That's right.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: ...the end of March. (Unintelligible)<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: The end of March. Remember that letter you signed to me?<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Uh, huh.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: 30th of March.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: I signed it to you? Yes.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Yes sir, and it says, "Dean's off of it. I want you to get into it. Find out what the facts are. Be prepared to--"<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Why did I take Dean off? Because he...<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Because he was involved.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: ...he became involved: I did it, really, because he was involved with Gray.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Well there was a lot of stuff breaking in the papers, but at the same time...<br /><br />HALDEMAN: The scenario is that he told you he couldn't write a report so obviously you had to take him off.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Right, right.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: ...and so then we started digging into it and we went to San Clemente. While I was out there I talked to a lot of people on the phone, I talked to several witnesses in person, kept feeding &nbsp;information to you...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Right.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: ...and as soon, and as you saw that the, that the dimensions of this thing from the reports you were getting from the staff--who were digging into it--Moore, me, Garment and others.<br /><br />HALDEMAN: You brought Len Garment in?<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Len Garment, yeah.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: You began to move.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Yeah.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: You began to move.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: I want the dates of all those...<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: I've, I've got those.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible) Go ahead, right, and then--<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: And then, uh, uh, it, it culminated last week...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Right.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: ...in your decision that Mitchell should be brought down here; Magruder should be brought in; Strachan should be brought in.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Shall I say that we brought them all in? [missing text?] can.<br /><br />HALDEMAN: I wouldn't name them by name. Just say I brought a group of people in.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: ...have witnesses personally come to the White House. I don't want to prejudice<br />their rights before the, before the, uh, (unintelligible).<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Exactly. But I heard enough that, that I was satisified that it was, it was time to<br />precipitously move. I called the Attorney General over, in turn, uh, Petersen..."<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Well, uh, the Attorney General, actually, you made the call to him on Saturday.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Yes.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: ...after you. But this was after you heard about the Magruder strategy.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: No, before.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Oh.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: We didn't hear about that until about three o'clock that afternoon.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Why didn't you do it before? This is very good now, how does that happen?<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Well--<br /><br />PRESIDENT: How do you n- Why wasn't he called in then? John, you had made a report.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Well...<br /><br />SEVERAL VOICES: (Unintelligible)<br /><br />HALDEMAN: John's report came out of the same place the Mitchell, the Magruder report did--<br /><br />PRESIDENT: No, my point is...(unintelligible)<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: I called him to tell him that I had this information.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Good. But, why was that? That was because we had heard Magruder was gonna talk?<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: No. We did it...Oh, I will have to check, I'll have to check my notes again.<br /><br />HALDEMAN: We didn't know whether Magruder was going to talk.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: That's right.<br /><br />HALDEMAN: Magruder was still agonizing on what he was going to do.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Well on Dean--but you remember you came in and said you've got to tell him about it<br />politely.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Well, now let's see.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible)<br /><br />HALDEMAN: I'll tell you the reason for the hurry up in the timing was that we learned that Hunt was gonna testify on Monday afternoon.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Yeah.<br /><br />SEVERAL VOICES: (Unintelligible)<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: All right, the President's, the President's right. The President is right. I didn't talk to Kleindienst. Remember, I couldn't get him.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Yeah.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: I didn't talk to him until he got home from Burning Tree, which was the end of the day,<br />and I had already talked to Magruder.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Right. But my point is when did we decide to talk to Kleindienst? Before Magruder?<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Oh, yes. Remember, early in the morning I said, "I'll see these two fellows but I've got to turn this over to the Attorney General."<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Who, who--which two fellows were you going to see?<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Mitchell and Magruder.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Because your conclusions are--yeah.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: I mean because, uh, I had this report and I tried all day long to get the Attorney General who was at the golf course and got him as soon as he got home for...<br /><br />[...]<br /><br /><br />HALDEMAN: And then Magruder came over. Well, you don't want to put that out. You don't want to, to specify who came, but th-, then you called in the other, other individuals. Then the President met with the Attorney General and the, and the Prosecutor and, uh, got the head of the Criminal Division on Sunday. You met with him twice actually, didn't you?<br /><br />PRESIDENT: No, I met, uh, yeah (unintelligible) on Sunday, Sunday at one o'clock, and then at four o'clock and I also talked to...twice on the phone to, uh...I met with Dean...<br /><br />HALDEMAN: You met with Ehrlichman and me.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: ...I met with Dean, Ehrlichman, you, and I also talk, talked, talked to the, uh, to the, uh, Henry Petersen on three different occasions, three different occasions, that night on the phone.<br /><br />HALDEMAN: Yeah.<br /><br />(Noise)<br /><br />--<br /><br />That's the end of that tape. Just to clarify: what they're doing here, explicitly, is rescripting the last two plus weeks into a fictional story of a Nixon investigation to get to the bottom of Watergate and the cover-up.<br /><br />Nixon then met with Haldeman again. Haldeman had consulted with Garment, the incoming White House Counsel (once Dean could finally be removed), and Garment's advice, which Haldeman passes along, is a thorough wipe: "that the P has to make a massive move and cut the whole thing out in one blow, which means getting rid of Ehrlichman, me, and Dean, and anybody else that may be at all involved." The other thing Garment wanted to tell the president? "[T]hat it is clear to him you are in possession of knowledge that you cannot be in possession of without action on."<br /><br />Of course, that is precisely what no one had really talked about during the long months from June through April, and which they still didn't seem to have managed to work out in their heads. Or maybe they did, and it was just far too late to do anything about it.<br /><br />After that, it was a two-hour meeting between Nixon and Petersen; he also spoke to Petersen by phone later in the day. Petersen told Nixon that Fred LaRue had told the grand jury about the cover-up, implicating Mitchell, and that Dean now said he would implicate Haldeman and Ehrlichman in the cover-up in exchange for immunity. But that's not the worst of it. If Dean doesn't get immunity...[Transcript from Emery]<br /><br />--<br /><br />Petersen: His [Dean's] counsel says he wants a deal. This man was an agent. This man didn't do anything but what Hald --<br /><br />Nixon: Haldeman and Ehrlichman told him to do.<br /><br />Petersen: -- and Mitchell, and if you insist on trying him, we, in defense, are going to try Ehrlichman, Haldeman, Nixon, and this administration. That's going to be our defense.<br /><br />Nixon: He'd try it. The president too?<br /><br />Petersen: It's a goddamned poker game. Yessir.<br /><br />--<br /><br />As Haldeman notes in his diary, Magruder is still trying to get full immunity too, and so he's not testifying yet either.<br /><br />So now they have a plan of sorts: the cover-up of the cover-up, with Nixon only recently learning that the "Dean Report" was a fraud, and taking matters into his own hands, breaking the case himself. Or something like that. Will it work? They're about to launch it and find out.<br /><br /><br />
Without the Filibuster?<----->I mostly want to call everyone's attention to two excellent posts, by <a href="http://editors.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2013/04/the_democrats_gun_filibusters.php">Brian Beutler</a> and by <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/17/filibuster-reform_n_3104519.html">Ryan Grim</a>, which take seriously a key fact about the gun bill consideration: simple majority votes on amendments would have not only allowed Democratic amendments to pass, but would also have <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/gun-amendments/">allowed Republican amendments to pass.</a> In particular, the Grassley substitute, backed by the NRA, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/gun-amendments/" rel="nofollow">received 52 votes</a>. But I'll do a little speculation and thinking about reform options from where they leave off.<br /><br />As they both point out, in a simple-majority environment, things might have been different. It's absolutely possible that Democratic defectors might have been willing to hang with mainstream Democrats if their votes were needed -- any whipping on amendments surely went into the close Democratic amendments, not the GOP items.<br /><br />This is not, in and of itself, a reason to oppose Senate reform in general, or even a majoritarian Senate in particular. But as I said before the bill came up: reformers should be clear what they want.<br /><br />For example: in a Senate with very loose controls on what bills and amendments come to the floor; with one tightly disciplined (or ideologically rigid) party; and with simple majority voting on everything, then the tightly disciplined party might do very, very, well over time. Even when it's in the minority, even when it's in a fairly significant minority, that party shouldn't find it hard at all to get its way on many, and maybe most, bills.<br /><br />Moreover, that minority party would have strong incentives to act as tightly disciplined as it could. After all, in a 55/45 Senate, if the minority can figure out something that can pick off six majority party Senators, they get to win as long as they all hold together. And as long as there are loose controls over the floor, they can design whatever they want with that goal in mind.<br /><br />The obvious recourse for the majority, in that situation, is to eliminate opportunities for the minority to offer amendments. Otherwise, they risk simply get repeatedly rolled by any smart minority willing to hang together.<br /><br />In other words, it's very easy for reform, once it starts, to wind up where the House has wound up -- with a majority party quasi-dictatorship.<br /><br />Again: that doesn't mean one should oppose reform. But anyone who thinks that majority party rule in which the minority cannot participate meaningfully in governing, including offering alternatives which can receive votes, is some sort of obvious democratic system is overlooking some very real problems with that kind of system.<br /><br />At the same time, anyone who is happy with a status quo which requires an arbitrary 3/5 supermajority for everything, and thinks that such a system is obviously the democratic one, is at least just as wrong if not more.<br /><br />What remains unclear is whether it's really possible to get a third alternative -- one that gives the minority party meaningful participation, and which allows intense minorities (whether they are partisan minorities or just minorities on some issue) to have real chances to succeed against indifferent majorities.<br /><br />To be sure, there are reasonable arguments in favor of majoritarianism and against that third alternative, but in my view they are losing arguments (as are those favoring the 60 vote status quo). But if it isn't possible to design the third alternative, then it doesn't really matter whether the theoretical arguments hold or not.<br /><br />Still, I think the arguments about democracy are important and worth keeping at center stage during these debates. It's simply not true that democratic theory would consider a pure majority-party-run Senate to be necessarily the most democratic. You can argue it, but you need to do so, from where I'm sitting.
Everything You Want To Know About the 60 Vote Threshold Agreement<----->The votes on the gun bill amendments were held under a unanimous consent agreement requiring 60 yes votes for an amendment to be adopted. That seems to have <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/04/for-the-love-of-god-just-call-it-a-filibuster/275087/">confused some of the coverage</a>, in particular about whether this was filibuster-related or not. The answer, as I said yesterday, is that it absolutely is filibuster-related: Manchin-Toomey and the other amendments which reached 51 votes but not 60 were in fact defeated by filibuster, and that's what reporters should be saying. See yesterday's post for the <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/04/manchin-toomey-and-filibuster.html">general discussion of the gun bill and filibusters</a>, but here I want to sketch out what we know about this particular Senate procedure.<br /><br />Key points if you don't want to read a long post:<br /><br />1. The 60 vote threshold procedure is relatively new.<br /><br />2. It is a way of processing filibusters.<br /><br />3. It is very similar to the demise of "talking" filibusters: it's efficient for the majority party, given a known filibuster.<br /><br />4. Since the current situation is "filibuster on everything," there's always a known filibuster, so it's not surprising that 60 vote threshold votes have become common.<br /><br />First, by way of introduction: virtually all bills in the Senate are considered under some UC agreement, which govern which amendments will be brought up and under what conditions. Without a UC agreement, a single Senator could block progress at any point, so they don't move ahead until they read a deal. That's as opposed to the House, where bills are considered under a "rule" drafted by the party-dominated Rules Committee and approved of by a simple majority vote of the whole House that the majority party always wins. UC agreements are limited only by the creativity of the drafters and what they can get everyone to go along with.<br /><br /><a href="http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL34491_20080519.pdf">According to CRS</a>, UC agreements incorporating a 60 vote threshold began "from at least the early 1990s." There were none during the Congresses that met from 1999 through 2004. Then there were eight amendments and three measure which used that standard in the 109th Congress, 2005-2006, and it became more common in the 110th Congress, 2007-2008. That's what a 2008 CRS report has; a <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/RL34491-1.pdf">2009 version</a> doesn't have any more, and if there are more recent versions they don't seem to be available. (I've also checked with Greg Koger, and he doesn't have anything more specific).<br /><br />So: why a 60 vote threshold?<br /><br />It makes sense in the context of knowing that the minority intends to filibuster an amendment (or a bill). For the majority, it accomplishes quite a bit. It removes the time that a cloture petition would need to sit before a cloture vote could be taken; it also removes post-cloture time. That means that getting a vote on a controversial amendment can take a short time, instead of basically chewing up an entire week. Not only that, but if a minority party wants and without a UC 60 vote threshold, they can filibuster each of a series of amendments, each one using almost a week of Senate floor time, even if they don't care at all about that particular amendment.<br /><br />There's also the advantage, which either the majority or the minority might want, that it allows a substantive vote on something instead of a procedural vote. That might appeal to a minority which is being taunted to "allow a vote" on a measure; adopting the 60 threshold UC accomplishes that, at least to the extent that it confuses things.<br /><br />It's not included in the CRS report (which precedes the true 60 vote Senate initiated in January 2009), but in a situation in which absolutely everything the majority proposes, it seems to me that there's another important reason for the majority to use a 60 vote UC instead of just going through a series of filibusters. If both sides have amendments, then the majority is put (as far as I can see) at a disadvantage. For majority-backed amendments, 60 votes are needed to overcome a minority-party led filibuster. But what about for minority-backed amendments to a bill that the minority opposes? Of course, if the majority party has the votes, it can simply defeat those amendments by simple majority vote. But if the minority party can come up with more appealing amendments -- ones that can command a chamber majority but that most of the majority party opposes -- then what? If the majority filibusters those amendments, then the minority only has to allow the filibuster to continue in order to bring consideration of the bill to a halt. Got that? Democrats are in the majority. The Republican Smith Amendment comes to the floor, an amendment that could get 51 votes by holding all Republicans and a handful of Democrats. If Democrats filibuster the amendment, and if Republicans just let them filibuster indefinitely...then Democrats can't move ahead to final passage of the bill, since the Senate is still stuck on the Smith Amendment. In other words, under filibuster-everything conditions and without the 60 vote threshold UC agreement, majority party amendments will need 60 votes, while minority party amendments will only need 50 votes. That's a pretty good reason for the majority to prefer the 60 vote threshold on all amendments UC agreement.<br /><br />(Of course, by definition it's easier for the majority to get to any particular standard, whether it's simple majority or 60 or whatever. But it's not necessarily easier for the majority party to get to 60 than for the minority party to get to a simple majority).<br /><br />So overall, the 60 vote threshold should be seen as yet another accommodation that the majority party makes to constant filibusters from the minority party. Just as with the decision to avoid the "talking" filibuster, it's in the majority party's interest to do things this way if you assume that the minority will always take advantage of the filibuster whenever it can.<br /><br />Why, then, does the minority accept it? Well, partially it might be for the spin: as with the demise of the talking filibuster, it makes the filibuster less visible, and therefore perhaps more difficult to criticize. A lot of people believe that. I don't, really, but then again what really matters is whether the minority party believes it.<br /><br />My guess, however, is that it's really for the same reason that the minority party allows the majority to dispense with the reading of bills or any of the other things that require unanimous consent that the minority habitually agrees with, and the same reason why the minority doesn't simply act as a cartel to block absolutely everything the majority proposes: the minority party has an excellent deal in the Senate, and they probably don't want to push too hard lest the majority impose reform that would change that. It's one thing to insist on 60 votes for every amendment; that's new in Senate history, but it has some basis in Senate rules and norms. To insist on the majority needing 60 on amendments and the minority only needing 51...well, that risks majority-imposed reform.<br /><br />Okay, one more point. Remember all those charts you've seen that measured the rise of filibusters by counting cloture votes?<br /><br />These 60 vote threshold votes are one of the reasons that those charts are terrible measures of how many filibusters there are in the Clinton, Bush, and Obama-era Senates. None of the nine amendment votes on the gun bill that the Senate has considered this week have produced cloture votes, but all of the Democratic amendments -- and, in effect, in retaliation all of the Republican amendments -- were filibustered. So that's nine more filibusters not accounted for in the cloture vote count -- cloture votes (not filibusters, but cloture votes) which were avoided by a procedure that didn't even exist in the 1980s and earlier, and which wasn't used regularly until George W. Bush's second term.<br /><br />(Further complicating things: in a situation where most, but not all, things are filibustered, then you can get false positives here, too. That is: perhaps only one or two of the nine amendments would have really drawn filibusters. However, under conditions in which many or most things are filibustered, both sides may just agree to the 60 vote threshold because it's convenient. Yet anyone counting this is either going to come up with zero filibusters, thus missing real ones, or nine, thus (per this hypothetical) overcounting.)<br /><br />--<br /><br />Thanks to Greg K. and to another email correspondent, for pointers on this. I'll update/correct if there's anything more that turns up.

April 15, 1973 (part two)<----->We're now in the evening of Sunday, April 15. Nixon finishes up on the presidential yacht, and heads back: "I dreaded having to go to the White House and face the bleak choices I knew were waiting..."<br /><br /><a name="more"></a>Also, that afternoon, John Dean was again meeting with the prosecutors, Silbert and Glanzer. Before that meeting, however, Dean showed his own lawyer something new: Dean had a copy of the "Huston plan," the secret plan to have the government spy on, bug, and break-and-enter again domestic opponents. That's the plan that J. Edgar Hoover spiked -- which in turn was why, after the Pentagon Papers, Nixon and his men organized the Plumbers to do from the White House what the proper (as it were) government agencies had refused to do. Dean's lawyer put the documents in safe keeping, eventually turning them over to Sirica, the Watergate judge. Then, to the prosecutors, Dean let drop a huge one: that Liddy and Hunt had broken into Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrists office. And, Dean knew, that there were pictures from that crime in the possession of the Justice Department. They didn't pass that one on to Henry Peterson until the next day.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Haldeman and Ehrlichman, still not realizing the full extent of what Dean was doing, were waiting for Nixon when he gets back at 7:45. Finally, Nixon starts explaining it them; Haldeman notes that the president "was obviously very awkward in getting into all this and is hedging around, not knowing quite how to get to the point." And so Haldeman's diary is not very clear and there is no tape of tonight's meetings, but at the end of that part of the entry, in the sixth paragraph, he notes the "prima facie case against both Haldeman and Ehrlichman on obstruction of justice."<br /><br />Ambrose here has a detail here from Haldeman's book, with Nixon saying "I can't fire Dean. I can't risk his going after the President."<br /><br />At this point, Nixon and Henry Peterson talk on the phone. Peterson has nothing new to report (although he still isn't completely up to date on everything Dean has told the prosecutors at this point; remember that it's still not quite 24 hours since Peterson was brought in), but clarifies to the president that Dean's testimony is still conditional on a deal; "We cannot use it for any purpose unless he pleads.[...] Unless we strike some agreement with him."<br /><br />Following that (immediately, on the tapes) is a conversation betweeen Haldeman and his assistant, Larry Higby: Dean has called Higby, refusing to speak directly to Haldeman.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Higby: He said: Point one: "I hope you understand that my actions are motivated totally out of loyalty to you and the President."<br /><br />Haldeman: "You."<br /><br />Higby: "You." "And if not" --<br /><br />Haldeman: What a minute, wait a minute. "Totally out of loyalty." --<br /><br />Higby: "To you and the President."<br /><br />Haldeman: Yes.<br /><br />Higby: "and, if not clear now, it will become clear." "Two." --<br /><br />Haldeman: Wait a minute.<br /><br />Higby: "Ehrlichman requested to meet tonight, but I feel it's inappropriate at this time."<br /><br />Haldeman: Okay.<br /><br />Higby: [Three] "I am ready and willing to meet with you" -- meaning the President -- "at any time to discuss these matters." ...[Four] "You" -- meaning the President -- "should take your counsel from Henry Peterson, who I assure you does not want the presidency hurt." That's the end of his message.<br /><br />--<br /><br />[That's the Kutler transcript; with the last two numbers interposed from Haldeman's diary]<br /><br />Nixon decides to take Dean up on his offer, and Dean is fetched to the White House, meeting with the president, alone, at 9:20.<br /><br />They cover a wide range of topics: that they had previously discussed Hunt's blackmail and the possibility of clemency for him; the "million dollars" that could be arranged, which now (in Dean's version) Nixon referred to as a joke; Dean's current negotiations with the prosecutors; the case for Haldeman and Ehrlichman's obstruction of justice; and the possibility, Dean said, that Gray had destroyed the material in Hunt's safe. Emery notes that Nixon, in discussing the possibility of Dean's resignation -- for remember, Dean is still, insanely, White House Counsel -- apparently said that Haldeman and Ehrlichman were also ready to resign.<br /><br />According to Dean in his book, some other points. He suspects, from how Nixon acts at one point, that the conversation is being taped. He has Nixon emphasizing that Dean can't tell the prosecutors about their conversations because they are privileged, or about the various Plumbers and other White House materials because of national security. He also says that when he was leaving, he said he "hoped my going to the prosecutors and telling the truth would not result in the impeachment of the President."<br /><br />There's nothing in Haldeman's notes about Dean's conversations with Nixon.<br /><br />One problem needed to be cleared up immediately: Hunt's safe. After the arrests in June, Ehrlichman had told Dean to "deep-six" the material, and later agreed to Dean's suggestion to give it to Gray with instructions that it should "not see the light of day." Now, with Haldeman and Nixon in the room, John Ehrlichman calls Acting FBI Director Pat Gray.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Ehrlichman: Pat, this is John Ehrlichman.<br /><br />Gray: Yes, John. Good evening.<br />[...]<br />Ehrlichman: I wanted to tell you that John Dean has apparently decided to make a clean breast of things with the U.S. Attorney. One of the questions that apparently they've been asking him is about the envelope that he turned over to you.<br /><br />Gray: Yeah, well, he better deny that.<br /><br />Ehrlichman: Well, he's apparently pretty much on the record on that. I thought I'd better alert you to it<br /><br />Gray: What the hell am I going to do about it?<br /><br />Ehrlichman: I don't know. Is it still in being?<br /><br />Gray: No.<br /><br />Ehrlichman. I see. I don't know.<br /><br />Gray: I was told it was purely political and I destroyed it.<br /><br />Ehrlichman: I see, okay. It probably was.<br /><br />Gray: Is there any way you can turn him off?...<br />[...]<br /><br />Ehrlichman: You might want to take a look at your hole card where he's concerned, because I don't know all the ins and outs of your relationship or, you know --<br /><br />Gray: The only think I can do with this is deny it.<br /><br />Ehrlichman: Okay.<br /><br />--<br /><br />That call begins at 10:45. Ehrlichman then calls back (at 11:05, according to Haldeman) and tells Gray to "level on this if you're asked" and "just state the facts." Gray says: "I'd state it in a different way, that at no time did he [Dean] indicate that this was from Hunt's material." Which really doesn't make much sense.<br /><br />Nixon says of Ehrlichman: "We watched the blood drain from his face as he listened to the reply" and has him saying "There goes my license to practice law" when he gets off the phone.<br /><br />It is, in a day of devastating news, another huge blow: they have successfully conspired to destroy evidence, and it's going to be revealed.<br /><br />With that, Haldeman and Ehrlichman go home. Nixon isn't finished. He calls Peterson again, talking about a potential Dean resignation (which Peterson isn't exactly thrilled about; from his perspective, after all, Dean has become something of a good guy). Nixon emphasizes that the two of them, Nixon and Peterson, are now in charge and will work together to keep Nixon "one step ahead of the curve." As Emery notes, however, the immediate impulse to cover up continues: Nixon, having just heard new evidence of a crime, mentions nothing to Peterson of Gray's destruction of evidence. Of course.<br /><br />By then Haldeman is home, and Nixon calls him at 12:30 AM to report on the latest conversation with Peterson. Nixon, this time, softens the blow; he passes along Peterson's recommendation that Haldeman and Ehrlichman get lawyers, but also interprets Peterson as saying that obstruction of justice is a difficult case to actually prove. Oh, Haldeman notes, wearily I suppose, in his diary:<br /><br />--<br /><br />The P said he had been sitting there making some notes and thinking about the whole thing. He obviously wanted to talk on and on about it, but I didn't encourage that.
Manchin-Toomey and the Filibuster<----->The background checks portion of the bill <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/us/politics/reid-says-he-will-vote-for-assault-weapons-ban.html?hp">will be defeated today</a>. It was being added as an amendment to the bill, and under a consent agreement all amendments needed 60 votes; it's not going to get there.<br /><br />Some notes:<br /><br />1. The correct thing to say about this is that the amendment was defeated by filibuster. It's a little tricky, but that's the essence of it. The UC agreement under which the amendment (and all amendments to this bill) is considered requires 60 votes; that's agreed to in order to avoid a cloture vote, which is necessary because of the standing GOP plan to filibuster everything. It is wrong to say that "Senate procedure requires 60 votes." Senate procedure only requires 60 votes <i>in case of filibuster</i>. Which, under current conditions, means in virtually all cases. Manchin-Toomey is defeated by filibuster.<br /><br />2. All that said: anything that gets only four Republicans wasn't going to win in the House. Right now the House is split 232-201. Four Republican Senators is 9% of GOP Senators; the same percentage in the House would be 20 Republican votes, which means a tiny majority in the totally unrealistic case that every Democrat voted for the bill. So there's a very good chance there isn't even a simple majority in the House. Which wouldn't be close to enough: for Republicans to be willing to take up the bill at all, most mainstream conservatives would want the bill to come up (although not necessarily be willing to vote for it). That's simply not going to happen on a bill that gets 4 of 45 Republican Senators.<br /><br />3. It's also important to remember that Manchin-Toomey is one of a series of possible provisions in an overall bill, and that filibuster rules also <i>protect the majority</i>&nbsp;to some extent. The 60 vote threshold that's blocking Manchin-Toomey may be necessary to prevent poison pill amendments from being adopted. Indeed, knowing that it takes 60 to get anything into the bill should change the opponents' strategy: instead of trying to design an amendment that would get a majority and then lead to the majority party abandoning the bill, the opponents may simply design amendments that will lose but supply votes which can be exploited later on.<br /><br />4. Note that in the House, governed as it is by strict majority party rule, the majority party doesn't have to worry about popular amendments (or bills) that they don't want; they simply refuse to allow votes on them.<br /><br />5. It is not entirely clear that a majority party rule system in which popular amendments and bills do not receive any vote at all, even if they would get a majority of the full chamber, is more democratic than a system in which everyone can force votes on any bill or amendment, but it takes 60 votes for passage. It's not even totally clear that a chamber in which every amendment and bill could always get a simple-majority vote is more democratic (because of the poison pill problem, and more generally because of unstable "majorities" on issues), but that may be irrelevant because in practice it's hard to get that middle ground.
Read Stuff, You Should<----->Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0840133/">Kristine Sutherland</a>, 58. <br /><br />Also, good stuff:<br /><br />1. Kevin Drum highlights <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/04/elena-kagan-writes-awesome-dissent">an Elena Kagan dissent</a>. <br /><br />2. Scalia, <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/?p=49355">not so much with the judicial temperment</a>; Rick Hasen has it.<br /><br />3.

To me, that raises the question: could Paul have sounded like a jerk because he really didn't know what he was talking about? Once again, there are costs for having an information structure within a party dedicated to fooling you own followers.<br /><br />4. And Alyssa Rosenberg has some advice for the TV people for <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2013/04/16/1871761/five-angles-that-would-have-improved-cable-news-coverage-of-the-boston-marathon-bombing/">how to fill time during a crisis</a>. I think the problem she identifies -- what to do in a situation where one-subject coverage seems appropriate but actual news only shows up in bursts -- is an excellent one, whether or not you agree on her specific suggestions.
April 15, 1973 (part one)<-----><br />PRESIDENT: Yeah. I had a call from Kleindienst.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Yeah. I heard you did and I thought you ought to take it.<br /><br /><br />PRESIDENT: Oh sure, sure, I didn't, I didn't refuse. He said "I should see you, and I'd like to see<br />you alone this afternoon. Today." I said fine.<br /><br /><br /><a name="more"></a>That's from a morning conversation this Sunday, April 15. Kleindienst, having finished hearing about Dean's testimony, arranges to report to the president. At this point, however, there's been no deal struct between Justice and Dean -- and if there's no deal, then Dean can still, according to the rules, withdraw his testimony completely. So nothing is quite done yet; indeed, Dean still doesn't know if he's going to get any deal at all. And of course Dean's testimony, while seeming to the prosecutors to have the appearance of truth, is still only mostly his word.<br /><br />Kleindienst doesn't say what the meeting is about, only that he wants a one-on-one meeting with Nixon right away; Nixon schedules him for after a church service (it's Palm Sunday). First, he <a href="http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/trial/exhibit_23.pdf">talks to Ehrlichman</a>. They go over where the various pieces of it stand, including speculation about whether Hunt, if he is about to talk, will limit himself to Watergate or "go broader" in Ehrlichman's words -- that is, the Plumbers.<br /><br />Then church, and then, a little after 1PM, Kleindienst in the EOB office. Both Emery and Ambrose tell the story of the meeting from the tape (which I don't have). Apparently it takes a while to actually get to the point, with Nixon sidetracking him. But finally: both Haldeman and Ehrlichman may be in trouble from testimony from Magruder -- and Dean (and, apparently, Strachan, as well, is ready to talk).<br /><br />Kleindienst tells Nixon that Dean has connected Ehrlichman by saying it was his orders to get rid of the material in Hunt's safe (which were in fact given to Pat Gray, who eventually destroyed the evidence), and that he also had given the order, after the arrests, for Hunt to leave the country.<br /><br />For Haldeman, it's that he had knowledge of the Liddy-Hunt operations because Strachan had passed along paperwork on it to him, and the $350,000 fund that was used for hush money.<br /><br />Nixon, as Emery tells it, finds it difficult to stick to what he's supposed to know. He's surprised to find out that Liddy hasn't and still won't talk (the prosecutors had duped Dean on that one, and Dean had relayed it to the White House). He slips and mentions Hunt's wife's role in distributing the hush money to the other defendants, although he catches himself before saying too much.<br /><br />Ambrose emphasizes Kleindienst's repeated suggestions of a special prosecutor -- who, at that point, Kleindienst could have appointed and made sure it was someone sympathetic to them. But Nixon doesn't buy it. Instead, he wants to meet with Henry Peterson, who Kleindienst intends to give Attorney General power for this case since he has to recuse himself (thanks to his closeness to Mitchell, at the very least), later.<br /><br />That's the meeting. Nixon brings in Ehrlichman after Kleindienst leaves. This time, we have no tape (either it ran out or something was done to it). The president then calls Haldeman at 3:30. Haldeman's notes are not particularly dire, although there is this: "Then he said also they told him that, on E, there was some connection on the conversation regarding the contents of Hunt's safe, and on Haldeman, there was some connectdion with the $350,000 and that those were the only leads they had on us. Kleindienst recommends that E and Haldeman take a leave of absense. The P said you out to come up with a better recommendation.<br /><br />Nixon's reaction appears to have a surprising lack of urgency or even alarm, from what we know of it. Granted: he would have been careful not to betray too much to Kleindienst. And then -- was he holding back with Haldeman and Ehrlichman? Already in the process of detaching himself from them?<br /><br />Nixon now has his first direct meeting with Henry Peterson, the head of the criminal division at Justice. Peterson tells the president that Dean has given them a case against both Haldeman and Ehrlichman on obstruction of justice. From Nixon (via Emery) we get the key exchange, with Peterson saying "The question isn't whether or not there is a criminal case that can be made against them that will stand up in court, Mr. President. What you have to realize is that these two men have not served you well. They already have, and in the future will, cause you embarrassment, and embarrassment to the presidency." And when Nixon protests that he doesn't want to fire them without proof of their guilt, Peterson again: "What you have just said, Mr. President, speaks very well of you as a man. It does not speak well of you as a president."<br /><br />Nixon tells Peterson, who by now has written authorization to act on Watergate, to deal with him directly -- a move which puts Peterson, who at this point says he was still not even suspicious of Nixon's involvement, in a compromised position despite himself. Basically, the Assistant Attorney General has now traded in keeping the White House informed through John Dean (pre-Gray) to keeping the White House informed through President Nixon. For the second time, Peterson doesn't grasp the scope of what he's up against.<br /><br />Indeed, we have a tape of Peterson talking to Silbert from the White House; as Kutler notes in his introduction to the transcript, we don't know whether Nixon was in the room, but we do know that Nixon would have had access to the tape. Silbert, the chief Watergate prosecutor, has been hearing more from Dean and Dean's lawyer (who, remember, are still trying to cut their best deal); Silber is reporting back to Peterson. And recall: we're at 4PM on Sunday, and Peterson only found out about Dean a bit less than 24 hours before. All this is still brand new to him.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Peterson: ...How are you coming?<br /><br />Silbert: [...] [Dean's lawyer Charles Shaffer]'s position is hardening a little, in the sense that if John [Dean] is believable, we have an obstruction case against Haldeman and Ehrlichman, in the sense that they knew everything that was going on.<br /><br />Peterson: If -- if John Dean is believable, you have an obstruction case against Haldeman and Ehrlichman?<br /><br />Silbert: Well, let me say this to you. They knew everything that was going on. That is, all the plans, like the Magruder plans and, you know, they were -- like Ehrlichman was present -- again, going through the same stories about the (unintelligible), get rid of -- Hunt ge out of town. He and Haldeman are in on the money. I mean, Ehrlichman and Haldeman are in on the money, clearly. I mean, the $350,000 comes from Haldeman, and he's putting it in that Haldeman told him to get it back over there and they knew that the money was coming -- I mean, the demands were being made and finally they had to give this money up.<br /><br />It was Haldeman's decision to send it all back to the committee, and he told John [Dean] to do it, and that's when John called Strachan. Strachan, you know -- Strachan's testimony is inconsistent with that. [...]<br /><br />But John's is much more credible [....]<br /><br />--<br /><br />At this point Nixon decides, of all things, to go for a cruise on the presidential yacht with his friend Bebe Rebozo. They talk about a defense fund for Haldeman and Ehrlichman...whether that's because Nixon feels responsible for helping out his closest assistants after all they've done for him, or whether this is just another round of realizing how much harm they could do him and wanting to keep them "on the reservation" now that they may be heading to prison, is I suppose something to speculate about.<br /><br />More on this extraordinary Sunday later.<br /><br />
Elsewhere: Torture, Budget, OFA<----->Over at PP today, I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/04/16/how-do-we-keep-from-torturing-again/?hpid=z3">brought back</a> my argument for how to prevent another round of torture: pardons plus Truth Commission.<br /><br />And two new(ish) columns to link to. My Salon <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/04/13/save_your_cash_forget_ofa/">item</a> over the weekend suggested that people who want to support Barack Obama's agenda shouldn't donate to OFA -- their money is better spent on candidates in the 2014 cycle.<br /><br />While at TAP, I <a href="http://prospect.org/article/what-does-balance-budget-even-mean">talked</a> about what people think they're talking about when they talk about balanced budgets.<br /><br />Oh -- just a quick update for Watergate readers. There's been so much over the last few days that I've fallen behind. I'm scheduled to work at April 15 tonight...I'm not sure how much there is, so it's possible I'll fall even farther behind (I'm pretty sure there's enough that I can't get to the 16th also). Not to worry, though; I think I'm better off getting more in, even if it means losing the conceit of 40 years exactly for a few days. At the worst, I'll get caught up once things settle down after the end of April, but with any luck I'll be up to date within the next few days.
Catch of the Day<----->Well, some days, you don't have much of a choice, do you? The catch has to go to economists&nbsp;Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash, and Robert Pollin, who have a new paper out demolishing&nbsp;Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff on the effect of high government debt on the economy -- with a big assist to Mike Konczal, who wrote a <a href="http://www.nextnewdeal.net/researchers-finally-replicated-reinhart-rogoff-and-there-are-serious-problems">clear and readable blog post explaining the conflict nicely</a>.<br /><br />The headline here is that Reinhart and Rogoff apparently made a simple computation error, but the Herndon-Ash-Pollin critique goes well beyond that -- as do <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/holy-coding-error-batman/?smid=tw-NytimesKrugman&amp;seid=auto">other critiques</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/16/is-the-best-evidence-for-austerity-based-on-an-excel-spreadsheet-error/">previously aired</a>&nbsp;(disclaimer: I haven't read either paper; I'm just relying on what economists and economics-literate bloggers and reporters are saying).<br /><br />While it's probably a good idea to be cautious of the critique (just as it would have been a good idea to be cautious about the original paper), it certainly isn't good news for preachers of austerity.<br /><br />I've seen some snark on twitter suggesting that no one who has recommended austerity, including those who specifically cited Reinghart-Rogoff as their reason, will flip as a result of this. That's probably correct! But only because it's extremely unlikely that very many people really relied on economics in the first place.<br /><br />So my guess is that this debunking will get exactly as much weight now for most people as the original paper had: very little.<br /><br />A more complicated question is how much should economists count towards economic policy? After all, if the profession is capable of making a mistake this big (apparently), should they be trusted? The answer, I would argue, is that politicians should certainly make use of economists -- and other experts -- but be very wary about hearing only what they want to hear. That's a lot easier said than done, and it doesn't really give policymakers any clear, bright rules, and it doesn't even assure success if you're good at it. All it does is increase your chances of policy success. But that's still worthwhile!<br /><br />That is, all of this does really point to a key governing skill: being good at sifting through expert advice. And perhaps the first thing about that is that a politician will only be good at it -- only get good at it -- if she realizes that it's important and really tries to do it. As opposed, say, to simply choosing policy and then seeking out supporting expert opinions. Because one can always find expert support, no matter how goofy the policy preference. Again, however, even if you go about it the right way -- even if you are looking for what the experts really do think, and you want to take that into account when choosing policy -- it's still going to be extremely difficult to be good at it. Especially when you realize that policy-makers in general, &nbsp;and presidents in particular, must do it across an impossibly wide range of policy areas which involve all sorts of different disciplines. Each of which has its own internal debates. Many of which have entirely different forms of credentialing and peer review. Most of which ever have a definitive answer -- but all of which have people who promise that what they have found is the definitive answer.<br /><br />Also: nice catch!
Oh, I'm Going to Hate This In About Four Years<----->After Hoover was defeated in 1932, the next incumbent to lose in a general election was Ford, in 1976, followed in short order by Carter in 1980 and Bush in 1992. Add in Johnson in 1968, and incumbents are beaten all the time!<br /><br />But now, with a run of three presidents who were successfully re-elected, get ready for it: you're going to be hearing a lot about how incumbent presidents can't lose under today's conditions. Here's <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/in-political-campaigns-do-you-get-what-you-pay-for/?smid=tw-share">a preview from Tom Edsall</a>, who attributes this effect to campaign finance:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The ability of an unchallenged incumbent president to flood the airwaves during the summer of an election year, combined with the advantage an incumbent has raising general election money a full two years or more before the election, has significant consequences. Early money is crucial to the long-haul development and testing of high-tech voter contact research techniques. An incumbents built-in edge over out-party challengers, who must first spend millions to win the nomination, is now so strong that it almost guarantees two-term presidents.</blockquote>This, along with some stuff about how economic conditions in 2012 should have made for an easy Republican victory -- which ignores both the evidence of the political science modelers and the common sense intuition that maybe voters remembered when the crash happened.<br /><br />Now, as it happens, incumbents do win often -- not just for re-election to the White House, but for all offices at all times. After all, the one thing we know about incumbents is that they won! Usually, with basically the same electorate, or at least close to the same electorate, that they are facing in the next election. Forget about everything else, and just focus on that, and you'll expect them to win the next time. Indeed, there's really something wrong if they don't win more often than they lose; it would indicate to voters are constantly changing their minds, and that's not a positive sign.<br /><br />I do think that the expectation to the contrary is based on a good government fantasy that every election should begin -- for every voter -- from square one, with voters carefully studying the positions on public policy issues from each candidate from scratch and deciding their vote based on an impartial calculus of exactly which candidate is best on those issues. Which is neither what happens in the real world or, I'd argue, would be any better than what actually does happen in the real world. (Worse? Well, I'm open to and willing to defend most methods for determining one's vote, but it wouldn't be a way I'd recommend).<br /><br />I may say more later about the campaign finance specific stuff in Edsall's post, but look: this is coming. You get three straight re-elections, and people are going to believe that it's inevitable, and throw their favorite causes at this supposed effect. But it isn't inevitable. It's just worked out that way.

April 14, 1973 (part two)<----->John Ehrlichman was supposed to have confronted John Mitchell and basically told him to take responsibility for the Watergate break-ins -- given that it was clear, at this point, that Mitchell is going to be indicted and probably convicted anyway.<br /><br /><a name="more"></a><br /><br />But when <a href="http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/trial/exhibit_19.pdf">Ehrlichman reports back to Nixon and Haldeman</a>, he has to tell him that none of that happened. Mitchell claims to be innocent -- claims not even to have been at key meetings -- and says that it was all Bob Haldeman's plan to begin with, anyway:<br /><br />--<br /><br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: ...Says it comes --the origin of that, of course, was in the White House where Bob<br />Haldeman and I talked about something called the Operation Sandwedge. That was really the grandfather of this whole thing. And, of course, that was never put together because we couldn't get the right people to<br />do it, and -- They were talking about Joe Hoods and people of that kind," and so he said "It never happened."<br /><br />PRESIDENT: What is Operation Sandwedge?<br /><br />HALDEMAN: It's, it was something that Jack Caulfield...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible) Oh, yes.<br /><br />HALDEMAN: ...came up with back in '71, and we needed some intelligence and ought to set up our own Intertel.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Dean has also made his report by now, in the late afternoon, and that's also passed along to the president:<br /><br />--<br /><br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: (Sighs) I haven't any idea. Dean seems to think everybody in the place is going to get<br />indicted. (Laughs) No, this afternoon -- Well, I...<br /><br />HALDEMAN: They're all doing the same thing. What Dean said is just looking at the worst possible side of the coin that you could make a list of everybody who in some way is technically indictable in the cover-up operation. And that list includes, in addition to Mitchell, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Colson, Dean, --<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Because they all discussed it?<br /><br />HALDEMAN: Strachan, Kalmbach, Kalmbach's go-between, Kalmbach's source, LaRue, Mardian, O'Brien, Parkinson, ...<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Bittman<br /><br />HALDEMAN: Bittman, Hunt, uh, and, and, you know, so, and just to keep wandering through the impossibles, he said maybe the route is for, for everybody on that list to take a guilty plea and, and get immediate, uh, uh, what do you call it, pardon, or, uh, ...<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: Clemency.<br /><br />HALDEMAN: ...clemency.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: From the President.<br /><br />HALDEMAN: Hmm. That shows you the somewhat unclear state (Laughs) of John Dean's analytical<br />thinking.<br /><br />EHRLICHMAN: No way.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: It's a shame. There could be clemency in this case and at the proper time, having in mind the extraordinary sentences of Magruder, and so forth and so on, but you know damn well...<br /><br />HALDEMAN: It's gotta be down the road<br /><br />PRESIDENT: It's ridiculous. They all know that. Colson knew that. I mean when you talked to Colson and he talked to me.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Ehrlichman leaves after a while, and the conversation ends with just the president and his chief-of-staff:<br /><br />--<br /><br /><br />(27 second pause)<br />PRESIDENT: I guess we're not surprised at Mitchell, are we?<br /><br />HALDEMAN: No. It's partly true.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: (Unintelligible)<br /><br />HALDEMAN: What he's saying is partly true. I don't think he did put it together.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Hmh. He shouldn't - he shouldn't throw the burden over here, Bob, on you. Now, frankly, Colson I understand, but, cause Colson certainly put the heat on over there. I don't think John would seriously have believed that you put him up to this thing.<br /><br />HALDEMAN: I told you I didn't. He knows I didn't. (Unintelligible). No question of that.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: I should think he knows it. He let it all happen himself. (20 second pause) (banging on desk to beat of music) So he saw more, huh?<br /><br />HALDEMAN: That's what he says.<br /><br />PRESIDNET: You know he'll never - he'll never go to prison. (20 second pause) What do you think about that as a possible thing - does a trial of the former Attorney General of the United States bug you? This God damn case.<br />**********<br />HALDEMAN: It really is.<br />(18 second pause)<br />PRESIDENT: He'll have to take the stand at some time. What the hell is this anyhow?<br /><br />--<br /><br />We're at 4 in the afternoon on a Saturday, now, but the day isn't nearly over.<br /><br />Magruder comes in, and tells them that he's testifying. He lays out his version of the entire story of Watergate, and <a href="http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/trial/exhibit_20.pdf">Ehrlichman and Haldeman relay it to Nixon in their next meeting</a>.<br /><br />Ehrlichman makes his call to Attorney General Kleindienst. This is, according to their earlier script, supposed to be the big "Nixon has broken the case" call, but with Mitchell not on board all Ehrlichman really has is what Justice already has. Or would have: Kleindienst is still totally in the dark, and isn't sure exactly why the White House has more knowledge than Justice, anyway.<br /><br />And with that, they all go, of all things, the White House Correspondents dinner, which happens to be that night.<br /><br />But not everyone is at the gala.<br /><br />Silbert and Glanzer, the prosecutors, had finally reached the point that evening that they were ready to move. They call Henry Peterson, the head of the criminal division at Justice, to his office, and now let him know about what Dean and Magruder have been telling them, from the original Watergate plot all the way through to the hush money and obstruction of justice. They need to make decisions about immunity, and generally about plea bargains.<br /><br />Peterson's response: "The president is going to be impeached."<br /><br />And that's without Dean, so far, having told them anything about Nixon's involvement.<br /><br />At the White House, Nixon has returned from the White House Correspondents and, at 11, he <a href="http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/trial/exhibit_21.pdf">calls Haldeman</a> to go over the situation again:<br /><br />--<br /><br /><br />PRESIDENT: At least, at least I think, I think (laughs) now we pretty much know what the worst is I, I do I don't know what the hell else they could have that's any worse, you know what I mean, unless you know...<br /><br />HALDEMAN: That's right.<br /><br />PRESIDENT: Unless there's, and I mean, I don't know that uh, unless somebody's got, uh, some piece of paper that somebody signed or some God damned thing but...<br /><br />HALDEMAN: Well...<br /><br />PRESIDENT: ... that I doubt.<br />HALDEMAN: Doesn't appear that there is such a thing.<br />(pause)<br />I mean, there's been no hint of that, what's in here is, is all stuff that, that, uh, has been hinted at. It goes further than, than what was, uh, found in some areas but it's, obviously it's totally consistent basically with what everything John had developed.<br /><br />--<br /><br />And then Nixon <a href="http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/trial/exhibit_22.pdf">calls Ehrlichman</a>. They talk about the possibility of Haldeman leaving; they also review Ehrlichman's conversation with Kleindienst, earlier. And they go through, again, the idea that Ehrlichman has now investigated the case for Nixon and discovered...well, all the stuff that Henry Peterson just heard about.<br /><br /><br /><br />As Dean expected, Peterson insists on immediately telling the Attorney General. And so, at 1AM very late Saturday night, Silber, Glanzer, and Peterson all go to Richard Kleindienst's house and, for the next four hours, they lay out the entire case to him. And that, at 5 AM early Sunday morning, is how Saturday April 14 ends.<br />
Breaking News..<----->I'm on a short break from jury duty this afternoon and seeing now the horrible news from Boston.<br /><br />I'll just repeat when I say whenever there is breaking news: reporters do as good a job as they can, but they'll get stuff wrong. Sometimes, badly wrong; sometimes, just a little. Sometimes, even the most basic, seemingly obvious "facts" turn out to be off.<br /><br />Pundits speculating? Even worse. <br /><br />We'll know more soon. Until then, take a deep breath, take in information if you like, but be aware that there's every possibility that what you're hearing isn't quite right, or perhaps not right at all.
