[7]Doing a Good Deed Like a Smile :)

   27 Feb 2013 [8]1 Comment

   by [9]hausatrends in [10]Uncategorized

   In this worldly life, any human being has at least a very small chance
   of helping another human being. A person can help another in many ways.
   From the smallest to the biggest.
   If you make a person smiles by smiling at them just for the happiness
   of being, you have no clue how much you help them conquer a positive
   energy in their life. Negative energy is very inhuman and bad we all
   should avoid getting attracted to it.
   Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) teaches us to smile and exchange greetings by
   saying ‚ÄòAssalamu Alaikum‚Äô ( peace be unto you) because these two things
   are magnificent in helping and uniting us in one way or another.
   You walking on street and see something harmful, you stop, take that
   thing, and park it in a place where nobody can get harmed. Do you
   realize that you do not help only one person but the whole society in
   general? That is so positive. You prevent your society from getting
   negative energy. Your society will be quite positive and healthy. That
   is what prophet Muhammad (PBUH) teaches us.
   You see, any person in this world can do good and any good act somebody
   does will definitely help in one way or another.
   You have a little knowledge of something good and you spread it to
   other people, there is no need to highlight how you help them a lot
   because you know you do.
   I discover that I can help my society with anything I have but there is
   a need for me to wake-up and stand strong in order to do that important
   thing. Yes, I need to have the courage to give-out something, no matter
   how small is it, to people.
   There is NO need for me to be like Bill Gates or Aliko Dangote in order
   to be able to help people. I can satisfactorily help them with the
   little I have. I can help them in any way I can because I want to make
   them happy not sad, I want to help them smile not cry. Oh yes, I can
   help them just for the sake of Allah.

   A mysterious symbol of circle with football design inscribed in it and
   the Twitter hashtag #WinnerTakesEarth surprisingly appeared in
   Guanabara Bay (Rio De Janeiro, Brazil) where the 2014 FIFA World Cup
   will be hosted. The symbol and the hashtag also appeared in New York‚Äôs
   Times Square and London‚Äôs Hackney Marshes. It‚Äôs a global mystery, huh?

   [37]20131030-195116.jpg

   [38]20131030-195333.jpg

   This event then started to look serious as a group of 11 unknown men
   (11, the number of players in a football team) were spotted in Bayer
   Munich‚Äôs Allianz Arena. They dressed in black robes and the same
   circular symbol that‚Äôs spotted across the globe was on the chest of
   their robes. Likewise, these Mysterious Guys were spotted in Juventus
   Stadium (Italy) and Stamford Bridge (London, UK), making strange
   synchronized gestures. You can‚Äôt say the look of the Mysterious Guys
   isn‚Äôt pure evilness! It‚Äôs like in a Hollywood movie and whenever I look
   at them and their type of symbology, I remember Dan Brown‚Äôs series of
   secret society fictional novels. It‚Äôs funny, I was even wishing that
   the outstanding character in the series, Richard Langdon, a Harvard
   Professor of symbology and the best in the world, is real, just to
   explain this circular symbol!

   But why? Why on Earth? I got a sigh of relief after I watched the
   German World Cup winner and coach, [44]Franz Beckenbauer‚Äôs 48 seconds
   YouTube message about the #WinnerTakesEarth and the Mysterious Guys.
   Here‚Äôs exactly what he said in the video:

     Hello ladies and gentlemen, I am Franz Beckenbauer former football
     player in Munich. Let me ask you these; do you think that aliens
     exist? Do you think that they play sports? Friends, I have some
     horrifying news! The answer to both these questions is yes. Last
     night I was invited by an extra-terrestrial race. Yes, aliens and
     they want to play football against us! The problem is if we lose
     *they will destroy the planet*! Now it‚Äôs up to us to put together a
     team. *Only football can save the planet*. More to come!

   [45]20131030-205016.jpg
   Franz Beckenbauer spotted at Stamford Bridge during Chelsea‚Äôs BPL match
   against Manchester City! Here, one of the Mysterious Guys was behind
   him. I spotted the old German but I was unlucky enough not to spot the
   Mysterious Guys

   Hahaha! Crap! The problem is if we lose they will destroy the planet!
   What if we win? Poor Beckenbauer was not confident enough to talk about
   aliens in the video and how dumb is he to think that human race are
   fool enough to believe *only* football can save the planet Earth?
   I understand this is all about mind control! Slowly slowly they made
   more than one billion people on Earth fall in love with football and
   now they‚Äôre trying to show how important it is that it‚Äôs the *only
   thing* to save the planet these days (The End Times?)

   The #WinnerTakesEarth is a mysterious global ad campaign that has to do
   with what its lovers call The Beautiful Game or maybe the mysterious
   technology company that‚Äôs behind this shocking campaign is trying to
   challenge its biggest rival in the planet!

   What is the mysterious technology company that‚Äôs behind this weirdly
   horrifying event? The website of this ad [46]mysteriouscircles and its
   [47]YouTube channel somehow contain Samsung technology hint! And the
   simple proof is this programming image

   [48]20131030-211213.jpg
   which clearly shows that the Asian mobile technology company set their
   server to private but made a silly mistake of hosting the website (an
   even the videos) with their own name! They should‚Äôve change the name to
   mysteriouscircles instead! And you know what? Why the Mysterious Guys
   appeared in the three stadiums mentioned? Probably because Samsung has
   a connection with them!

   [49]20131030-211443.jpg
   A screen captured image of the mysteriouscircles website displaying
   their videos of the Mysterious Circles and the Mysterious Guys
   happening at different locations cross the globe

   And now to Beckenbauer, he‚Äôs a respected man in the football world!
   That‚Äôs all I know but I can‚Äôt actually say why they selected him to
   send that shocking video-message to the World and maybe he agreed to do
   that because of money! Anyway, he‚Äôll lose that respect and trust in the
   eyes of football fans!

   He said ‚ÄúMore to come‚Äù in the video which directly means that they
   (aliens) are coming to Earth on Friday 1st November. Haha! It‚Äôll be fun
   watching the extra-terrestrial race play against the human race! I
   guess they‚Äôll be running at the speed of light!
   Never mind :)‚Ä¶

   My friend [50]Naseer Musa Tofa (Enemtees) was the first to notify me of
   this bizarre marketing ad and another friend of mine [51]Abubakar M.
   Ibrahim (Falson) was giving the impression that it‚Äôs none of our
   business but thanks to my uncle (Baffa Ibrahim) who boosts a confidence
   of having peace of mind to me.

[133]Senator Yarima‚Äôs Interview ‚Äì Waka A Bakin Mai Ita Ta Fi Dadi

   28 Jul 2013 [134]2 Comments

   [141]emlanis, [142]hausatrends, [143]nigeria, [144]northern nigeria,
   [145]Northerners, [146]Senator, [147]Shari'a, [148]suleiman garba sule,
   [149]Yerima, [150]Zamfara

   Former Governor of Zamfara State, Senator Ahmed Sani Yariman Bakura,
   spoke to the media over the controversial issue regarding this
   constitutional phrase ‚ÄòFull Age‚Äô which majority of Nigerians was highly
   controlled to misunderstand and overreact. Senator Sani Yarima is one
   of the most criticized Nigerians but he admits that ‚ÄòI never mind‚Äô at
   all. He says that his Egyptian wife (now 17 years old and has a baby)
   was 14 years when they got married not ‚Äô13 years‚Äô as the western media
   are still ranting about. The senator also implies that his 16-year-old
   daughter is getting married this September and he cannot wait to see
   the happening of the event. Here is the interview in full length‚Ä¶

   You have been the butt of criticisms for the past one week over what is
   now widely tagged ‚Äògirl-child marriage.‚Äô What actually happened at the
   Senate and what exactly was your role?

   In the first place, a lot of Nigerians are not conversant with the
   Nigerian Constitution. The Constitution recognizes three systems of
   justice ‚Äì the Shari‚Äôa Law, the Common Law and the Customary Law ‚Äì and
   makes ample provisions to protect adherents of all religions ‚Äì Islam,
   Christianity and traditional religions. Most of these provisions have
   been there since the 1979 Constitution. This particularly contentious
   section was there in the 1979 Constitution and is also in the 1999
   Constitution.  Section 29 of the 1999 Constitution talks of the rights
   of a citizen of full age to renounce his citizenship. The core issue is
   not the renunciation, but the definition of full age. What defines full
   age? Section 29 (4) (a) of the Constitution says full age means any
   person who is 18 years old and above. And there is the (b) part which
   says any married woman is considered to be of full age. Why does it say
   this? It is because the Second Schedule Part 1, Item 61 of the
   Constitution clearly ousted powers of the National Assembly to make any
   law regarding marriages under Islamic Law and Customary Law. The
   Schedule says the National Assembly can make laws on the formation and
   annulment of marriages, excluding marriages under Islamic Law and
   Customary Law.  So the issue is the definition of what full age is.
   Everybody, including Christians, knows there are sources of Islamic
   Law, largely the Quran and teachings and practice of the Holy Prophet
   Muhammad (PBH). Section 29 (4) b conforms with Islamic Law. Under
   Islamic Law, any girl that has reached the age of puberty is a full-age
   woman. What is puberty in Islam? Puberty is when a girl starts
   menstruating or she has extended breasts; she is of full age. Any girl
   that has started menstruation can be married out. This is a sign of
   maturity. Therefore, if your daughter starts her menstruation at the
   age of nine, 13, 14, at whatever age, she is of full age and she can
   marry at that age, once she is mature as far as Islamic Law is
   concerned The Child Rights Act today, as it is, has nothing to do with
   Islamic Law. It only affects those who conduct their marriages under
   the Common Law. Even if you conduct your marriage under Customary Law,
   as the Igbos do, and you don‚Äôt go for Christian wedding, and you marry
   a girl of 14 years, nobody cares, because the Constitution says the
   National Assembly cannot make laws that affect formation and annulment
   of marriages.  We should realize that in this country, the only thing
   that can guarantee peace is adhering to Section 38 of the Constitution
   which guarantees freedom of religion. That provision makes me, as a
   Muslim, to respect the opinions, religious beliefs and aspirations of
   the Christian, while the Christian should also respect my own religious
   beliefs.  People are just trying to overheat the system. But really,
   there is nothing there to overheat because this provision is in the
   Constitution. We didn‚Äôt make this Constitution but are only trying to
   amend it. Those who put it in the Constitution were trying to protect
   the interest of the Muslims who believe in Islamic Law. Anybody who
   doesn‚Äôt believe in Islamic Law will have nothing to do with it.

   But how did your particular remarks spark off a whole lot of
   controversy?

   What really happened was that when the voting was going on, I didn‚Äôt
   notice it. Even when the debate was going on at the committee level, I
   wasn‚Äôt there. I had gone to Lagos and when I arrived there, they had
   passed that section. It wasn‚Äôt discussed in my presence, otherwise I
   would have raised an observation. But when I saw it in the
   constitutional amendment, that they wanted to remove it, I raised an
   observation.  By the time I saw it, the election had been conducted and
   the Senate had agreed to remove the section. Then I got up and said
   that, ‚ÄúMr. President, this section was put in there to protect Muslims
   who believe in Islamic Law, and removing it would be affecting the
   right of Muslims. Moreover, I pointed out, removing it would not be in
   conformity with the relevant part of the Second Schedule which
   restricts the National Assembly from making laws on the formation and
   annulment of marriages. But he said, ‚Äúunfortunately, Senator Yerima, we
   have voted and you should have raised this issue before voting. Now
   that we have voted, we cannot do otherwise.‚Äù So I sat down. It was time
   for prayers and I went to pray. When I came back from prayers, I met
   the Deputy Senate president raising a point after voting, trying to
   explain something in order to reverse voting that had been cast on an
   issue. It was then the Senate Leader also raised another observation on
   the next issue. Then, I raised an observation that, ‚ÄòMr. President, you
   said the observation I raised on my issue cannot be revisited because
   it has been voted upon, but now that there is revisiting of voting on
   other issues, I demand that my issue be voted upon again.‚Äô Then Danjuma
   Goje raised his hand and supported me. Of course, he made some remarks
   to the effect of double-standard, which the Senate president was not
   happy about. Maybe he (Goje) should have put it that if he (the Senate
   president) could allow the other two people to revisit their
   observations, then he should have allowed Yarima‚Äôs observation. Anyway,
   Mr. President in his wisdom, accepted. David Mark has been a wonderful
   Senate president since I knew him in his first term as president of the
   Senate. He is a good listener and tries to ensure he carries everybody
   along. He is also very sensitive about matters affecting not only
   religion but every individual. He wants fairness. And so he said, ‚Äúfor
   that reason, we will vote again.‚Äù And when we voted, we won. This is
   the issue.  Before the voting, the Deputy Senate president raised an
   observation that this issue is not a matter of marriage but on the
   renunciation of citizenship. But I said that, well, my concern is on
   the definition of full age. I just wanted the vote because in my
   religion, under Islamic Law, full age is not defined by age. Once a
   girl reaches puberty, she is of full age.

   You just spoke highly of the Senate president. But he was reported by
   the newspapers to have said senators voted to support your observation
   under blackmail. Were senators truly blackmailed, and how?

   I don‚Äôt see the word ‚Äúblackmail‚Äù as used by Senate president David Mark
   as negatively used. It‚Äôs semantic. I didn‚Äôt see it as a negative
   statement. Whenever I am criticized for my actions by the media or the
   public, what I try to get from that criticism is where I have gone
   wrong and I try to correct it. But when I am sure I am doing the right
   thing, it doesn‚Äôt bother me. Praise-singing doesn‚Äôt flatter me. I don‚Äôt
   believe in praise-singers who will always tell me I am a champion. The
   most important thing is that I believe in my faith and I know I would
   be accountable for my actions when I die.  I know I will face
   criticisms, I will continue to have this problem because I am a Muslim
   and I cannot change my faith. A committed Christian will face the same
   problem I am going through. Today, the Western world is losing their
   values. Churches are being sold because few people go to churches. They
   are trying to change the world into a free world to give the impression
   that nothing like God exists. They first started to separate State from
   religion. In Nigeria, that is difficult because if the Constitution
   itself recognizes religion, then it is part of our political system.
   When the gay marriage bill came to the National Assembly and the West
   said if we don‚Äôt pass it we would not receive aid and grants, the
   Senate president said ‚Äúto hell with aid and grants‚Äù if only we have to
   pass the bill.

   The Senate president also hinted the early marriage issue will be
   revisited? With the barrage of criticisms that attended this voting, do
   you see a change in the voting process?

   That is when there will be another constitutional amendment, not now.
   But I am telling you, if we revisit this issue one million times, we
   will not have two-thirds of the votes to pass it. Any constitutional
   amendment requires two-thirds of the Senate and two-thirds of the House
   of Representatives. Every Muslim who understands what Islam is will not
   vote to remove that section of the Constitution. If it is voting to put
   the clause there, that is a different thing entirely; then I should be
   accused of bringing something sensitive into the Constitution. But it
   is already there and I only said, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt remove it‚Äù, in keeping to my
   faith. What is wrong with that? The framers of the Constitution knew
   what they were doing by putting it there.

   Are you sure we will not have more of your colleagues who would say
   they voted in error and ignorance the first time, like Senator Ayo
   Akinyelure from Ondo State claimed he did, and would vote in the other
   direction the next time?

   He didn‚Äôt even know how he voted. That is the power of God and you
   can‚Äôt challenge that power. There were Muslims who wanted to vote in
   favor of retaining the section, but they voted yes, which meant ‚Äúremove
   it‚Äù. Maybe that man wanted to vote no against Yarima, but his ‚Äúno‚Äù to
   the committee meant ‚Äúleave it‚Äù.  So he had to face his people back home
   to cry he voted in error.

   Were you expecting the strong backlash that has attended your
   observation, re-voting and the result?

   I have become used to it. As I said, Nigerians are lazy or carelessly
   unaware of our laws. When I introduced the issue of Shari‚Äôa, for
   example, I was expecting it to be a local affair and my only area of
   concern was how to address the fears of Christians in my state. So I
   called for a meeting of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN)
   leaders and explained the issue to them. They have always supported me,
   especially the Lady of Fatima. They have been strong supporters of my
   campaign and, till today, they still support me. I explained to them I
   would be implementing the Shari‚Äôa law in Zamfara State. Then, anybody
   who heard anything about Shari‚Äôa was thinking somebody would be killed.
   But I explained to them that Shari‚Äôa is only about the principle and
   practice of Islam and does not affect anybody who is not a Muslim.  I
   made it clear there was no compulsion about religion. If there is a
   case between a Muslim and a Muslim, it goes to the Shari‚Äôa court. If
   there is a case between a Muslim and government, it goes to the Shari‚Äôa
   court. I told them if there is a case involving Christians, it goes to
   a magistrate court. Someone raised an observation that what would
   happen if it is a case between a Muslim and a Christian and I said in
   that case, it is the right of the Christian to choose which court to
   go. To be cautious, we said if a Christian decides to go to a Shari‚Äôa
   court in a case involving him and a Muslim, the Christian should put
   his application in writing and the CAN signature must be appended on
   it, so that tomorrow, he would not say he was forced to appear before a
   Shari‚Äôa court.    When I came up with that Shari‚Äôa law, many people
   began shouting. I received more than 5,000 letters from Amnesty
   International from all over the world. It was when I announced I would
   be implementing the Shari‚Äôa law that I knew the enormity of protest
   that would confront me. Initially, I thought it was a just a local
   affair. Christian leaders have endorsed, after discussion, the
   implementation. They said, ‚Äúgo ahead.‚Äù They even asked at the meeting
   what and what I was going to ban. I told them I wasn‚Äôt banning anything
   new. The Northern Nigeria Penal Code, which has been operating since
   the British colonial era, has banned alcoholism, has banned
   prostitution and has banned gambling, so these are not new issues. The
   only issue is that I am bringing in the Shari‚Äôa court to provide full
   jurisdiction cover for the Shari‚Äôa law, both criminal and civil.  So
   the Christians leaders said, ‚Äúno problem then, once it doesn‚Äôt affect
   us.‚Äù     When  the  former president, Olusegun Obasanjo called us to a
   National Security Council meeting, he was shouting, ‚ÄúYerima o, Yerima
   o, you want to cause problem for us, you are introducing an
   unconstitutional matter.‚Äù I told him, ‚ÄúNo, no, sir, it‚Äôs not
   unconstitutional.‚Äù Even late Bola Ige, who was Minister of Justice
   said, ‚Äúthis is unconstitutional.‚Äù And I said no, ‚Äúyour Honorable
   Minister, you are not the one to interpret the Constitution. I am
   relying on Section 6, sub-sections 4 and 5 which state specifically
   that only the Supreme Court can provide jurisdiction. I am also relying
   on Section 36 sub-section 12 which states that if you are creating any
   law, it has to be qualified. So I complied with that sub-section by
   qualifying my law. I am also complying with all the other sections of
   the Constitution, a fact I mentioned to the Justice Minister.  I told
   him it was not for him to interpret. The same Constitution provides
   that it is only the Supreme Court that can interpret the Constitution‚Äôs
   provisions. So if he wants, he could take me to court. The federal
   government could take me to the Supreme Court and if the Supreme Court
   says I am not doing the right thing, then I would stop it. In fact, I
   would resign.  One of the laws was put to test. I signed a law
   establishing what I called the Hizbah, which they called the state
   police. It wasn‚Äôt a state police; it was just to support the Shari‚Äôa
   project. The Kano State government then adopted the initiative and the
   federal government took the Kano State government to court. The Supreme
   Court interpreted it that it was a right constitutional provision. Till
   today, Kano State has the Hizbah because the Supreme Court has approved
   it, correctly interpreting the section of the Constitution that we
   relied on to enact the law.  It is the same thing with this issue;
   people don‚Äôt know the Constitution. In fact, many Nigerians don‚Äôt even
   know there is a provision for the Shari‚Äôa in the Constitution. Somebody
   was telling me the Nigerian Constitution is a secular one. I told him
   no, the Nigerian Constitution defines Nigeria as a multi-religion
   society because it recognizes Christianity, Islam and traditional
   religions.

   Were you ever embarrassed by scathing articles and cartoons attacking
   your name on this marriage age controversy?

   No. If you are doing the right thing and your conscience is very clear,
   you won‚Äôt be embarrassed by people abusing you. Most of these abuses
   arise either out of ignorance or out of sheer deliberate mischief to
   cause embarrassment. Some Muslims who abuse me are either being hired
   or sponsored by non-governmental organizations. I have been taught to
   be patient. This is a matter of belief and faith.

   The argument by civil society groups is that there is no way the
   educational progress, health and true love feelings and emotions of a
   girl will not be affected if she is given out in marriage at 13 years.
   How wrong are they?

   Civil society groups just say what they are not informed about because
   their projects are being funded. And they keep silent when it suits
   their interests. Look at the issue of gay marriage. Religious
   organizations in Nigeria have been condemning gay marriage, but civil
   society groups here are either silent on it or even saying it should be
   approved. In the United Kingdom, they say the marriageable age for a
   girl is 18 years. It was 16 then they changed it to 18. But a girl, in
   current UK laws, is of full age when she is 14 years. At 14, she can
   buy contraceptives, she can have sex, but she cannot marry. I saw a
   bill by one of their parliamentarians saying because of the growing
   number of their girls getting pregnant and delivering at 10, 12, 14
   years, they should reduce their marriageable age to 12 years.  They are
   Christians but they accept that a lady can buy contraceptives at the
   age of 14 because that is their own definition of full age. In the
   United States of America, their problem now is teenage pregnancy and
   birth. Why? Because they allow girls to have sex at 12, 13 years but
   they don‚Äôt want early girl marriage, they don‚Äôt want a family
   arrangement My religion, Islam, and even Christianity, does not accept
   sex out of marriage. Those who are marrying at 12 years, are they not
   going to school? My wife has just completed her Master‚Äôs degree at
   Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria. She is a medical doctor. The Egyptian I
   married recently is in school. Yes, she has a child, she is 17 years,
   but she is in school. They said I married her when she was 13 years but
   actually she was 14. Her family status does not affect her education.
   It depends on the particular family values. I believe in education. All
   my children are educated. I have three daughters who have graduated
   from the university. One is an accountant, one a pharmacist and one is
   on her own. I have a 16-year-old daughter who will be marrying in
   September and she is in 200 Level in the university. Somebody was
   asking me: Can you give your 13-year-old daughter out in marriage? If
   she has a husband at 10 years old, I will give her out in marriage if
   she is mature enough. I will highly celebrate the marriage of my
   16-year-old daughter in September and let me see who will tell me I am
   doing something unlawful or wrong in any way. It is nobody‚Äôs business.
   The husband is also doing his Master‚Äôs and they will continue their
   lives from there. I also married my first wife when she was 16   to 17
   years.    It is a shame in my family to see a girl having sex without
   being married. But some families don‚Äôt care. Beyond Islam, there are
   some strict Christian families who will not allow men to come near
   their daughters unless those two children are married. But some
   families don‚Äôt care. Some parents, both in Islam and Christianity, will
   even go in and call their unmarried daughters for boyfriends because
   they want to claim they are westernized. That is their life. But I
   value my religion.  But then, that is my religion. I won‚Äôt foreclose
   the fact that Christians can equally do it their own way. In my youth
   service days, there were NYSC ladies who were Scripture Union members
   living in the same compound with me. My room adjoined theirs. Many days
   and nights, they would be conducting their programmes, praying,
   shouting ‚ÄúAlleluyah‚Äù and other Christian songs, but that didn‚Äôt bother
   me. Sometimes, I would sleep off. They preached to me and I preached to
   them. They would cook food, invite me to eat; I would also cook food
   and invite them to eat. We spent about six months together before I
   left the house. So, this religion thing should not divide us in
   Nigeria. But some people are using it as a weapon to divide us.

   It is amazing‚Ä¶ Maryam Uwais‚Äôs article or debate
   ([170]https://www.facebook.com/nasirelrufai/posts/10153032622305128) is
   too much for me that I find it boring to read‚Ä¶ That is especially when
   I begin to see some wrong moves and the fact that base on the comments
   on the Elrufai‚Äôs Facebook page show that she is really wrong at
   somewhere ‚Ä¶ The way I understand this issue is that the southerners
   call it *child marriage* while the northerners call it *early
   marriage*. To the southerners and the rest of the western world, you‚Äôre
   still a child even if you‚Äôre 17 YEARS 364 DAYS 23 HOURS 59 MINUTES and
   59 SECONDS! To US the northerners and Islam influenced countries;
   everybody knows that we do not consider 18 to be a minimum age of
   maturity‚Ä¶ Everyone develops at different maturity rate‚Ä¶ Sometimes sex
   is uncontrollable and how many under18 are caught having sex with old
   men in a hotel, club, bar, or a brothel in the western parts of the
   world??? Islam does not permit having sex without legal marriage
   between lovers and believe me WALLAHI ALLAH (GOD) KNOWS Northern
   Nigerians are trying so hard to avoid (zina) illegal sex not because we
   don‚Äôt want to or we‚Äôre impotent but because it‚Äôs the rule of God to
   shun zina and everyone among us believes doing just that helps spread
   positive energy to the society‚Ä¶ To me Islam has no specific age for
   marriage but once you are ready for it you know you are and also sex is
   not the only reasons for getting married islamically‚Ä¶ It kills me how
   everyone is ranting at 13 BEING THE AGE FOR THIS CHILD MARRIAGE YOU‚ÄôRE
   TALKING ABOUT JUST BECAUSE YOU‚ÄôRE TOLD BY THE WESTERN MEDIA THAT YARIMA
   MARRIED A 13 YEAR OLD EGYPTIAN‚Ä¶ What is wrong in getting married at 16,
   17, 18, 19 as a girl so long as you believe you can‚Äôt control your
   sexual needs and thirst? So long as you will be allowed to continue
   your education up to the fact that you can become a professor like
   Rukayya Ahmad Rufa‚Äôi? These days I‚Äôve never seen any man who marries
   his child at 13 the number most of the people are talking about BUT
   even if this man Yarima is directly (I‚Äôm not sure) talking about child
   marriage, long before Nigeria was born, in 1880 in Delaware, USA, the
   consent age (also the minimum age at which a child CAN be married) was
   7!!! Just seven! You can find a hell of a lot of countries in the west
   (Europe  and America) having minimum age for marriage (as a law) from
   1880 up to these days (2007) as 7,10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18 and so on
   here  [171]http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/primary-sources/24

      Finally, this is not our only problem in the country. In fact, it is
   not our worst problem. Nobody will even contact the government about
   the issue of marrying off his daughter or a son and the government
   itself will not even have the time to give a helping hand about that‚Ä¶
   To me as a Muslim, any marriage that is based on the Sunnah of Prophet
   Muhammad (Wallahi if it‚Äôs genuinely his Sunnah), is worth living for.
   So please my fellow Nigerians, ban all the negative energies on this
   matter that will not benefit the country. I believe even Yarima himself
   is doing that to distract us from pushing or making a cause that‚Äôll
   save Nigeria especially the North from the disaster we‚Äôre suffering
   from such as Boko Haram, the downfall of our economy, lack of
   electricity & good water supply and some important infrastructure.
   Please and please let us do this: uniting and respecting not insulting
   or harassing somebody‚Äôs religion or culture is ALL that is needed for
   Nigeria to move forward positively.
