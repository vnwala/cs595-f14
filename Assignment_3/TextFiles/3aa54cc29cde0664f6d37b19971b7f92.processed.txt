   just a friend staying happy

[5]That Optomistic Friend

[6]Short and Sweet

   hello there people, recently alot of things have changed and life is
   moving forward

   I’ve made a few changes in life to close off connections with certain
   people and ever since, things have been pretty good. Its for the better
   that i stay as far away from them as possible.

   I’m sure you are all interested in my life (sarcasm), but this time i
   just wanted to leave you with some things i’ve learned.

   I’ve learned that things happen for a reason and that i need to put,
   like, my happiness before anyone else’s. I know that sounds selfish but
   i mean, its true. If you’re not happy then why do it?
   Be happy.


   Thanks, i love your face


   XOXO- that optomistic friend

[10]Heart Ache….Kinda

   hello again old friends

   Sorry it’s been so long since i’ve been here. I’ve just been distracted
   with other things, other people……other problems.

   Well to keep you all informed, i was recently in a relationship that i
   ended sunday night. That is right ladies and gentleman that read this.
   i ended this interconnection of us two.

   I don’t know what it is about me and these guys that are complete
   assholes and crazy. Even though I’m the one who broke it off, I’m kinda
   sad. Its not that i don’t feel bad for the other person, its just like,
   come on bro i was a part of this too. I will say though, the guy took
   it harder than i did. I still have learning to do on how this
   relationship stuff works cause obviously I’m doing something wrong.
   Besides, experience is the best teacher (wink wink)

   i was happy. i just need to not rely on other people for my happiness
   anymore.

   One door closes, another one opens.

   How was your day? i would love to know. Hopefully it was better than
   mine.

   Anyways thank you for reading,stay awesome, i love your face.


   XOXO

[14]Rest.

   Hello there readers of the internet. Sorry for not posting anything
   yesterday. I didn’t really get anything done yesterday either. I had a
   rest day that was much needed and it was amaaaaazing. Before yesterday
   my whole week I was feeling depressed and tired for no reason. So
   yesterday was much needed.

   So I never realized how expensive it is being a senior. Today when I
   was looking at the order form for graduation, I was freakingggg out.
   Its happening too fast and its so overwhelming. But its nice. It’s nice
   thinking back to the end of freshman year and going to graduation for
   band and having those “almost” tears and the same thing happening up
   until this past year. Its just a lot and yeahh

   *sigh* graduation

   Anyways, how are you doing? I would love to know!

   Stay awesome

   Love ya face

[18]Change and Stuff.

   Its hard to think how much one person can change in 1 year. This time
   last year was so hard for me. Battling an eating disorder and drama in
   school. I was a mess. Everyday was a battle. Even though I’m still
   trying to recover from one of those, I have changed for the better. I
   am a different person than last year. And yes, I had/have an ED. I’m
   not proud of it, nor do i want to glamorize it, but, I’m ok now saying
   it and trying to deal with it. I’m not going to give anymore details
   about it, but I am getting better.   Anywaaaaaays, all I’m saying is
   change is good. Have a good night people of the internet.

   How was your day?

   Stay awesome.

   Love ya face.

[22]Regrets.

   Today was probably the worst day ever. I couldn’t even function after
   what happened. I think I’m just happy that this person is finally out
   of my life, like for good. Ugh, if I were to ever see this person i
   would probably slap them repeatedly and uncontrollably. He literally
   told me to f*** off and that I’m stupid and other mean stuff that isn’t
   worth repeating. I seriously regret talking to him and dating him and
   being friends after breaking up and yeah. He is just SUCH a mean
   person.

   So what I wanted time to myself? I’m supposed to tell you that? I think
   that if I never met this guy, I would have a much simpler life. This
   person caused me so much pain for so long, I just wish he knew how it
   felt. Its like he doesn’t even care. But whatever. I’ve wasted too many
   tears on this person and I’m not gonna sit and cry about it anymore.

   Sorry that I’m going on this huge rant about my day. It was just such
   an awful day. On the bright side though, I have to deal with this guy
   anymore. He’s probably tired of me too, sooo yeah.

   Anyways, how was your day?  I seriously would love to know how you’re
   doing today (:

   Stay awesome, love ya face.

[26]Thoughts.

   Heyy you guys, sorry I haven’t posted anything since monday. I’ve been
   so busy with school and I’ve been really tired for some reason too.
   Anyways, this past week has been really good! my classes are really
   easy, I haven’t had drama with anyone, and my confidence level is
   through the roof (:

   today, someone told me that my hair looked cute and that made me happy
   (: I know thats really nothing, but whatever.

   Goodbye and stay wonderful people of the internet .

[30]Beauty.

   Recently I’ve made some modifications to my image.. For the better of
   course. I finally feel as if I’m a beautiful individual, and if I feel
   like that on the inside, why not show people how I feel? I want to gain
   the self confidence that I’ve always wanted, but been too insecure to
   actually get. I know that there are waaaayyyy more attractive people
   than me, but now, I just started caring less about what people think
   and I think I might be getting off topic but whatever.  I’m not saying
   I’m changing. I’m still the same person, but with a bit more confidence
   (:
