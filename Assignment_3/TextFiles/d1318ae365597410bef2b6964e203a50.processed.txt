   It’s been… A while.

   So much is happening and part of me wants to document every single
   minute. Every second. Every breath, every heartbeat.

   But the other part of me struggles to find the time. And I wish for a
   few more hours in the day, but as that’s never going to happen, I’ll
   have to settle for updating this blog about twice a year!

   I am busy (work stuff), we are busy (family stuff) and the girls are
   changing and growing day by day.

   Back before the summer holidays we (the girls and I) met up with
   Carley. We had a brilliant day, aided – from my point of view – by the
   girls having an early but EPIC nap, which meant Carley and I could have
   a proper chat and gossip before they woke up. Which was really great.
   We had chatted back and forth via Facebook and Twitter and Carley was
   hugely instrumental in me setting this blog up as self-hosted (and my
   subsequent ability to set up a new website for the twins club we go
   to!) but this was the first time we had met in the real world. You
   never really know what it’s going to be like finally meeting people
   from the blogosphere, but (and I hope Carley agrees!) it felt just like
   old friends catching up, which was so lovely.

   We have also had the summer holidays and all four of us at home, which
   was just brilliant. We did quite a few day trips and a couple of mini
   breaks to visit family.

   We are now back into the grind of normal back-to-school life and I am
   once again doing the Shakespeare project at school, which this year
   means the girls are staying one night a week at my mum and step dad’s.
   They are really enjoying it and, although I know they miss us, I think
   we are actually possibly missing them more!

   I am still breastfeeding but we have recently cut out night feeds. I
   did it really gently by reading them a story about milky going to sleep
   at night and buying them a gro clock so they have a clear idea of when
   it is morning. We had a week or so of slight resistance – a few weepy
   cuddles – but now they both know and understand the limits and will
   happily talk during the day about what times they can have milky. It
   hasn’t had a dramatic effect in their sleep (yet?) but Claudia has
   slept through the night twice – at my mum’s! She did almost STTN at
   home a few nights ago, but Immie woke her up!

   Near the beginning of the summer holidays we made the transition from
   cots to toddler beds. They love their big girl beds and still get
   excited when they walk into their bedroom and see them!

   They have been two for two months now and so far the tantrums are no
   worse than they were before – although they do still happen!

   They are talking more and more going through phases of saying various
   things and learning new phrases and concepts

[37]Letters To My Two-Year-Olds

   [38]18 July 2014 [39]Laura [40]Birthday letters, [41]Cuteness overload,
   [42]Twin babies! [43]No comments

   Dear Claudia,

   I can’t really even begin to explain how much you have changed over the
   last twelve months. For one thing your hair finally started to grow and
   by 20 months you had gorgeous curls at the nape of your neck. You have
   blossomed when it comes to your confidence with new places and people.
   You are still happiest by my side when we are at playgroups, but you
   warm up to people so much faster than you used to. You have the best
   “shy face” we have ever seen (a slightly cheeky-looking sideways smile)
   which you use when someone is a little too close for comfort.

   You love books. Over the last few months you have enjoyed finding out
   what the ladybird heard, solving a monkey puzzle, spying out nursery
   rhyme characters (in a book you sadly no longer call something that
   sounds a lot like “itchy bum”), finding peace at last with Mr Bear and
   worrying about a ted who fell out of bed. You love to “read” a lot of
   these books to yourself, having memorised most of the words!

   Speaking of memory, yours is incredible. Back in February, shortly
   after you broke your arm (for the first time) we took you to Surrey
   Docks Farm. Stepping out the back onto the banks of the Thames, I
   spotted Canary Wharf and pointed out to you where Popsey works. A month
   later (shortly after you had broken your arm for the second time) we
   went back. As soon as we stepped out onto the riverbank you waved and
   shouted “Hello Popsey!” You are constantly surprising us with the
   things you can recall.

   And yes, you broke your arm twice this year. Actually you broke it
   twice within a month! You still talk now about Poorly Arm but you know
   it’s better now. I wonder if you will be able to remember it when you
   are older. You were so brave, barely crying, and being remarkably
   chipper about the nights in hospital. You won over all the nurses
   instantly – of course.

   You have always loved to communicate so it came as no surprise when you
   started talking and rapidly expanded your vocabulary, your
   understanding of context and syntax and your grasp of social niceties.
   You have pretty much got please and thank you nailed. At the moment, if
   I ask you to do something that you don’t want to do, rather than say no
   and run away like some toddlers would (not mentioning any names!), you
   simply say, “I’m all right” even when I’ve tried to outwit you by
   giving you a choice.

   “Claudie, would you like to wear the green nappy or the purple nappy?”
   “I’m all right.”

   “Claudie, would you like me to put you in your car seat or would you
   like to climb in yourself?”
   “I’m all right. I’m all right.”

   Unfortunately all your politeness doesn’t prevent the ensuing tantrum
   when I insist that in fact you do have to wear a nappy or you do have
   to go in the car seat, but I guess these are the terrible twos and I’m
   just trying to make them as un-terrible for you as I possibly can.

   Despite your apparent shyness or caution in new situations, sometimes
   you surprise us all with your confidence. Leaving a train recently, you
   shouted out to the business men trying to get off behind the double
   buggy I was attempting to manoeuvre “Bye, people! Seeya later!”

   You love to say seeya later. Recently, you have started pretend play
   and will often say to me, “Seeya later. I’m goin a shops.” You will
   often later say, “I’m back now” and we discuss what you bought (usually
   ice cream). We have tried to teach you “See you later, alligator” “In a
   while, crocodile” but so far the best we get is the hilarious “Seeya
   later, alligator-crocodile.”

   You love to cook in your play kitchen. Usually porridge. You like us
   all to have a taste and like to make us cups of tea too. You used to be
   very into In the Night Garden and as a result have three Upsy Daisies
   who mostly live in your bed these days. You used to call Iggle Piggle
   “Bugger”, which amused us no end! You have started taking care of your
   dollies and teddies, cuddling them and giving them “milky” or feeding
   them your snacks. Sometimes you pretend to tandem breastfeed the two
   foam dress-up-babies that stick on the side of the bath. It’s so cute!

   You really love to sing. Often, at Baby Bounce and Rhyme at the library
   you will cry for “more singing” after the half hour is up. You have
   quite a few songs in your repertoire now, although you are somewhat
   flummoxed by repeating lines at the end of songs and see it as an
   opportunity to just keep singing on a repetitive loop (Incey Wincey
   spider climbed up the water spout/Down came the rain and washed the
   spider out/Out came the sunshine and dried up all the rain/Incey Wincey
   spider climbed up the water spout/Down came the… You get the picture)

   You are such a delight to wake up to in the morning, even though I do
   sometimes wish you would manage just one whole night in your own bed
   (you slept for a solid 8 hours 25 minutes one night a few weeks ago so
   I shouldn’t really complain although that feat has yet to be repeated).
   As much as you can be quite a calm and “sensible” child – the kind who
   will walk hand in hand through a busy shopping centre and then sit
   calmly in a coffee shop (as long as provided with a babyccino and – if
   possible – a slice of cake thankyouverymuch!), you really do have your
   mad moments. You cavort around and jump and shout and laugh and are
   just a constant source of entertainment. Your smile could light up the
   night.

   You aren’t afraid to let us know when you need us, which, I hope, is a
   testament to the fact that you can trust us to respond to your needs.
   You stop my breath every day and I can’t believe how lucky I am to have
   this gentle, crazy, chatty, inquisitive, beautiful child in my life.
   You are an inherently happy person and your joy infects all those
   around you.  These few paragraphs just can’t do justice to the
   remarkable person you are turning out to be.

   I love you more than you will ever know.

   [45]Claudia Turns Two from [46]Becoming Mums on [47]Vimeo.

   Dear Imogen,

   My little Imp. You have blossomed this year. From your first hesitant
   steps just before your first birthday, you quickly were walking and
   then running, jumping, galloping and climbing. Oh how you love to
   climb! You will climb anything that will stay still long enough. Now,
   whilst you do it, you will often say to yourself “careful!” I imagine
   that’s because we’ve said it to you so many times. You are pretty much
   fearless and will attempt any physical activity without any thought as
   to whether or not you will be able to do it (usually you can, even when
   we suspect you might not be able to). You have incredible strength and
   love to dangle and swing from things, supporting your own body weight
   almost effortlessly with just your arms. You have mastered a forward
   roll, which is just incredible, and are always trying to find a new and
   challenging way of coming down the slide!

   We have been on two holidays in the last year and I think it’s safe to
   say that on both occasions the beach was your favourite part. You love
   the sand and you love the waves. You want to run and jump and splash.
   This April, when you took your first trip abroad, to Mallorca, I was
   standing with you at the water’s edge and pointed out a big wave. You
   raised your hand and waved at the sea.

   Your language has come on leaps and bounds over the last few short
   months, since our holiday when your favourite thing to say was your
   made up word: “dikki di di!” Around that time you also chose my name.
   You started calling me “Mama” and it stuck.

   We should have known it would have been you who solved the problem of
   how to differentiate between your parents – both female, both called
   Laura – as you seem to have a real passion for problem-solving and an
   incredible interest in how things work. You often spend ages puzzling
   over a new toy, trying to make sense of it. Sometimes your
   investigations leave a path of destruction in their wake and I try not
   to mind too much.

   You are Imogen the Destroyer – as we jokingly nicknamed you after one
   too many incidents of shredded toilet paper, ripped book pages and a
   very sorry looking HDMI cable – but you are also incredibly gentle. In
   face when I saw this image on Facebook a couple of weeks ago, I laughed
   out loud, because this is absolutely you.

   [48]toddlerduality

   You like to take things apart to get an idea of how they work, but you
   are also so affectionate. You like to dole out kisses when we are least
   expecting it, coming up beside one of us and planting a kiss on the
   back of a knee or an elbow. You kiss so softly, like you know it is a
   gentle, loving thing to do. When I carry you in the sling, you fall
   asleep stroking the back of my arm; at bed time you snuggle on our bed
   with Mummy and an array of cuddly toys, often finally drifting off
   stroking Mummy’s hand or arm. When you’re upset, I often don’t have to
   say anything, but just open up my arms to you and you come straight in,
   tucking your head under my chin and popping your thumb in your mouth.
   You love to snuggle, always asking to be wrapped up and tucked in a
   “bankelet” (you know there’s supposed to be an L in there somewhere!)

   You love your sister. You want to be wherever she is. You were lost
   when she broke her arm and you had to spend a few days and nights
   apart. You are her little shadow at the moment, always wanting to be by
   her side. It’s been incredible to watch your relationship develop and
   the two of you genuinely play together and have conversations now,
   which Mummy and I love to listen to. You have an amazing amount of
   empathy; you always try to cuddle Claudie when she is crying, even if
   she’s angry crying and doesn’t want to be touched. You will remark on
   babies crying when we are out and about and tell me they need a cuddle.
   You are so compassionate.

   You have a great sense of humour and a cheeky grin. You are stubborn
   and defiant but we love that you know your own mind. You are fiercely
   independent. You love books too – your favourite at the moment is one
   Auntie Jodie bought you. We have read it every night for at least the
   last month. (I may have skipped a page or two recently). Monkey and Me
   was another firm favourite for a while, so much so that you thought
   every monkey was MonkeyMe, including your monkey backpack.

   Your favourite toy has consistently been the doll’s buggy we bought
   almost a year ago. You have only in the last few months started putting
   anything in it to push around, preferring previously to just charge up
   and down, crashing into anything in your way, causing Mummy and me to
   refer to it as your “battering pram”. You have always quite liked
   taking turns with Claudia to sit in it and be pushed around by the
   other one. You are both getting a bit big for that now and I suspect
   the buggy is on its last legs. We will, of course, replace it straight
   away. How could we not? (Thank goodness it’s cheap!)

   Your favourite song is “pull clap clap clap”, otherwise known as ‘Wind
   the Bobbin Up’. You do a beautiful rendition of Twinkle Twinkle, very
   tunefully and you love singing at the library or at Twins’ Club. You
   have both gone off the Sleeping Bunnies song a bit recently, but we had
   lots of fun singing it at home when you first figured out the actions.
   You like to play Twinkle Twinkle on the piano and sing along with it
   very loudly.

   You make me smile every day. My heart skips every time you lean over
   and unexpectedly press your lips to my shoulder or the spot behind my
   ear. Sometimes you are a whirlwind; sometimes a soft breeze. I love
   that you are as unpredictable as the weather. But I also love that I
   know which book you will want to read before bed, which side you want
   your milky from and which stuffed toys need to be lined up in our bed
   so you can snuggle off to sleep (often after a round of extremely
   energetic gymnastics off the headboard). I love how much you love to
   watch a butterfly, a ladybird, a bumblebee, a snail. I love your
   fascination with the world and the new ways you make me see things.

   I love you so much, my little Imp. I love the way you curl up in my
   arms like you were made a perfect fit. I guess you were.

   I can’t wait to see what amazing things this next year with you will
   bring.

   I love you,

   Mama xxx

[63]Going a Bit Potty

   [64]25 June 2014 [65]Laura [66]Cuteness overload, [67]Foodie living,
   [68]Twin babies! [69]No comments

   In the interests of squeezing in one more post before my babies turn
   two (TWO! TWO!?!) in less than a month, this entry is likely to be a
   bit rushed and all over the place, but bear with me.

   Life is as busy as ever chez Becoming Mums but we are now on the
   countdown to the summer holidays and cannot wait! A lot of the girls’
   friends are having birthdays at the moment so they are starting to get
   to grips with the idea of what birthdays are. They are excited about
   cake!

   * * * * *

   We have had a bit of a lifestyle change in that we are attempting to go
   Paleo (if I have time I will go back and insert a handy hyperlink here
   before I hit publish; if not, I’m sure Google will tell you all you
   need to know). This has involved several major changes to what we eat
   to the exclusion of sugar, grains and gluten and a reduction in the
   amount of dairy we consume. At first I was starving, but we seem to
   have figured it out now – cutting out the majority of complex
   carbohydrates does mean you need to do something to replace all those
   calories! Our biggest struggle is that, living on one salary, we can’t
   really afford the high quality grass-fed meat that should be a major
   part of the Paleo lifestyle, not to mention organic veg, but with some
   compromises we are more or less making it work. L has become
   evangelical about it. In fact the other day she even said – bearing in
   mind she has always hated organised religion – that she has finally
   found her religion!

   * * * * *

   We bought the girls potties a couple of months ago. I am in no rush to
   potty train as with reusable nappies we aren’t having to pay out for
   new nappies each week and I’m also a firm believer that they will stop
   using nappies when they are ready, but we had noticed that they usually
   do a wee when they get in the bath, so we thought we’d introduce the
   idea of their own little toilet and see if they would pee in it before
   bath time. At first this appeared to be an abject failure and we
   thought they were a million miles away from them ever being ready to
   use the potty. But since then – particularly as they often insist on
   staying “nakey” after a nappy change – we have had a few successes.
   Still no more than I can count on one – or at a push two – hands, but
   progress nonetheless. Sometimes, of course, they still wee standing
   right next to the potty, so I know we’re a long way from nailing it. At
   the moment we’re just enjoying the freedom the good weather is giving
   them to run naked around the garden.

   * * * * *

   Yesterday Claudia said, “Mummy sit on the grass next to Claudie.” (If
   you were there, you possibly would have heard “mummy sit on a gahs nex
   a Daudie” and may or may not have been able to translate the
   toddler-speak yourself – it kind of amazes me that other people can’t
   understand everything they say, but of course I am immersed in it day
   by day!) they have both been speaking in real full sentences for a good
   couple of weeks, but the complexity of that sentence just blew me away.
   They are really talking and really able – most of the time – to make
   themselves understood. I can’t believe that this time last year they
   were still crawling and cruising around the furniture and could only
   say a handful of standalone words. Two months ago I started making a
   note of all the words I heard them say independently and in context
   (excluding proper nouns) as I had read that the average child should be
   able to use about 50 words by their 2nd birthday. I was just curious
   exactly how big their vocabularies are as I felt like they knew tons of
   words, but had no idea how many. By the time the count reached 200 I
   gave up! And okay, I know I’m totally bragging now, so feel free to
   tell me I need to shut up about how brilliant my kids are but
   sorrynotsorry my kids are brilliant!

[84]Hospitals, Holidays and Happy Families (And Everything in Between!)

   [85]16 May 2014 [86]Laura [87]Cuteness overload, [88]Holiday fun,
   [89]Parenting, [90]Twin babies! [91]One comment

   So much has happened in the last few months I’ve barely had time to
   draw breath, let alone blog about it.

   After Claudia had the cast off her Poorly Arm, she only lasted 10 days
   before she broke it again. I was devastated for her, not least because
   we were only three weeks away from our first holiday abroad as a family
   – the four of us were headed to Mallorca in the Balearics – and we were
   so excited about it, but of course we now were travelling with a 20
   month old who had her arm in a cast.

   She broke it in an absolutely tiny tumble off her Scuttle Bug (a small
   scooter/trike contraption we bought them for Christmas). It broke in
   the exact same place as last time so although the hospital insisted on
   testing for vitamin deficiencies and brittle bones it was clear the
   first cast had just come off much too soon. Getting it set was an
   absolute fiasco this time because there wasn’t a qualified (enough)
   anaesthetist on duty so we were transferred to another hospital and her
   arm was eventually set three days after she broke it. Immie found the
   separation quite hard but enjoyed going to visit her sister and
   exploring the playrooms on the children’s wards.

   Thankfully, one of the mums at the Twins’ Club we go to had a rubber
   cover for an arm cast as her daughter had fractured her wrist a few
   months before. It was an absolute godsend as it meant that she could
   still have a bath every day (their favourite time of day) as well as
   getting just as up close and personal with the Mediterranean as Imogen
   did when we were away.

   Our holiday was brilliant. The girls loved the beach and the children’s
   splash pool at our hotel was fab. They paddled and splashed and dug in
   the sand and went down the slides and we even got a moment or two to
   sit on a sun lounger. (But it literally was only a moment or two –
   thankfully we went with the expectations of not sitting down for a
   moment, so anything more than that felt like a real bonus.)

   [92]mallorca

   It was an amazing ten days and we were sad to come home, but these
   things must always come to an end.

   While we were away we discovered that Claudia could sing ‘Twinkle
   Twinkle Little Star’ and in fact they both now sing a number of
   different songs and are even confident enough to often do it on demand
   for various friends and family. They love holding the phone to their
   ear – especially if we are actually trying to have a conversation with
   the person at the other end – but rarely say hello. Mostly they just
   sing Twinkle Twinkle! Although the other day Claudia was shouting
   “Happy birthday!” down the phone to L’s cousin.

   Their language is just incredible these days. I get so excited each
   time I hear them expressing a new concept or stringing a new sentence
   together. Their favourite things to say at the moment are pretty much:
   “Immie do it”; “Daudie hold it”.

   Yep, we’re in that fiercely independent stage, which means a lot of
   frustration as they try to do things their motor skills can’t quite
   manage.

   They even made up a game together the other morning, where they both
   lay down in Claudie’s cot, pulled the covers over themselves and then
   one of them would shout, “Wakey up!” And they both jumped up. So cute.

   We are definitely finding it so much easier these days, although of
   course every age brings its own challenges, but it’s great now they can
   communicate a little more easily and can, for example, tell us if
   something hurts.

   They are really starting to build on their sentence structures now and
   are saying things like: “Immie’s turn next”; “A bit more”; “Singing
   now?” (Are these prepositions? As a teacher I am sure I should know the
   grammatical names but I’m really not sure in this instance.)

   Claudia has also occasionally started using ‘me’ instead of ‘Daudie’,
   which seems like an incredible leap forward. She will say things like,
   “Me climb in [to the buggy]“, which they love to do now. We have
   finally taken the bars off the front of the buggy (which Immie liked to
   rest her feet on when they were smaller) and now they can both climb up
   and sit down. They also love to walk though and we are able to use the
   buggy less and less. The main problem is that they do still need to nap
   in the day so we often do need to take the buggy to facilitate that,
   but wherever and whenever possible we let them walk.

   Just before we went away, Immie started saying “Mama” (l and I have
   always both referred to ourselves as Mummy and so have both girls). She
   would stand there repeating it over and over like a question until I
   would say, “Yes, Immie.” And then she’d just give me a really cheeky
   grin. As she kept this up, Claudie soon cottoned on and started using
   Mama to refer to me too. We always said the girls would figure out what
   to call us and it seems they already have. It’s totally stuck now and I
   like being Mama.

   Since my brother’s birthday in late April, they like to walk round the
   house saying, “Happy birthday, Colin!” Of course, we couldn’t get them
   to actually say that to him on his birthday. They are really enjoying
   exploring the sensation of different words in their mouths. Some of
   their favourite words to say include guacamole and ukulele! Every time
   we open the front door they say, “That’s our car!” As if the fact that
   it’s sat there on the drive is a total shocker. The cutest thing is
   that they also say goodbye to it when we go out and hello when we come
   back, but they haven’t quite understood the entire sentence, so they
   say: “Bye bye that’s our car!”

   [94]22 months from [95]Becoming Mums on [96]Vimeo.

   In other news, a lovely journalist interviewed me a while back for a
   feature in Mother & Baby magazine.  We were in the May issue as part of
   their ‘Modern Families’ spread, representing the LGBT family.
