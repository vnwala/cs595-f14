   Track Name: I WANT THE REAL THING
          The way I see it
          There's not much time
          Love is fleeting when it's undefined
          Tell me straight what I want to hear
          Tell me there's nothing to fear
          I can be louder than the demons you shake
          I can burn brighter than the day to day
          Only so much of this that I can take
          Tell me if leaving would make you stay
          Oh oh oh oh I want the real thing
          Oh oh oh oh I want the real thing
          Give me the real thing
          Someday I'll crack the code you made
          The day you saw through me
          Until that moment I'll live inside
          A frame you hung to see
          What I believe to be
          Oh oh oh oh I want the real thing
          Oh oh oh oh I want the real thing
          Give me the real thing
          Oh oh oh oh I want the real thing
          Oh oh oh oh I want the real thing
          Give me the real thing
          (I could turn around)

   Track Name: WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN?
          Will I see you? Will I see you again?
          It's our summer, it's our summer again
          Will I see you? Will I see you again
          Please don't tell me fight this feeling
          Please tell me I'll fight for you
          Please don't tell me fight this feeling
          Please tell me I'll fight for you

   Track Name: GO OUT AND REACH IT
          drive up the coast
          with the roses thrown
          echo the moonlight
          as your leaving home
          the lanes are changing
          they are overgrown
          theres a beauty when it's all unknown
          i want to go out and reach it
          always potential when there's nothing flown
          eyes on the road but my mind will roam
          i'll never payback all the things I owe
          but I can show
          i want to go out and reach it

   Track Name: RIBBONS
          Be a modern musician
          And not make a living
          It's an act of contrition
          Making visions with ribbons
          Lucky to be here
          Wish I could stay here
          Lucky to be here
          Wish I could stay here

   Track Name: BEEN A LONG TIME COMING
          Been a long time coming
          But it still feels strange
          Untangling the roses
          Wringing out the braids
          Been a long time coming
          But it still feels right
          The dust is all settled
          Let's say this tonight
          Carry all the oceans
          When the stars all turn black
          The wind pushes forward
          Instead of holding you back
          With heartbreaking dances
          To claim what is yours
          I'll take my chances
          In fighting this war
          Hell below, stars above us
          Heaven knows I"ve been honest
          Hell below, stars above us
          Heaven knows I"ve been honest
          When opposite forces
          Attract and change course
          Testing the waters
          And swimming round remorse
          But now I feel lifted
          Was I the weight on your back?
          Am I just drifting cuz we know we've been had?
          Hell below, stars above us
          Heaven knows I"ve been honest
          Hell below, stars above us
          Heaven knows I"ve been honest

   Track Name: RISE AND SHINE
          Rise and shine
          Get out of bed
          Time to play
          And stay out late
          Color all the corners
          Tearing down the borders
          Ignoring all the warnings
          Living out of focus
          We could go
          Out of style
          You and me
          For a while
          I could be your busted
          Radio eraser
          Two apartment darlings
          Appear into the ether

   Track Name: WOODEN LEAVES
          I bite off more than I can chew
          And the bark tastes like fruit
          Wooden leaves :=:
          Wooden leaves :=:
          I believe I believe
          Bite off the cement :=:
          Top the soil :=:
          There's nothing left to talk about
          Let's age in sync
          There's nothing left to talk about
          Let's age in sync
          I believe I believe I believe

   Track Name: FOOTPRINTS
          Follow the footprints in the snow
          A trail that's left behind, bestowed
          I hope I can transpose
          Eardrums from ground
          Frostbite to find a home
          You disavowed
          Compress my eyes until
          They block the light
          That stab between the trees
          My flint ignites
          nights
          Turn into sutures made of smoke
          That bind the houses made of oak
          The oxygen sustains
          The wind's shadows
          Breathe through the windowpane
          The fire soaked
          The vessels all filled up
          Covered in snow
          And as the heat escapes
          I hear echos
          home
          Follow the footprints in the snow
