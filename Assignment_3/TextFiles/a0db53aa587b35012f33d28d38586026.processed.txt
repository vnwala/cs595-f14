     * faux flying    9:33pm ET

[22]Using movie sets, a film studio aims to help people get over their fear
of flying

   Facebook.com/AirHollywood
   Facebook.com/AirHollywood

   It's the Safest Airline in the World, thanks to the fact that it
   doesn't go anywhere. At Air Hollywood, the goal isn't to get passengers
   to far-flung destinations, but to get them on a plane, period.

   Air Hollywood is a film studio in Pacoima, California, where hits like
   Bridesmaids and Lost filmed scenes in fake airplanes and terminals.
   Starting earlier this year, the studio began to offer classes to help
   people get over their fear of flying, enlisting the help of retired
   airline pilots like Capt. Ron Nielsen, who told a recent class, "You're
   not alone. We're going to demystify fear of flying. There are no drugs,
   there are no secret pills. All you do is you give yourself one moment
   of peace without the pink elephant jumping out at you."

   An estimated 60 million people have a fear of flying, [23]the Los
   Angeles Times says, with half refusing to fly, and the other turning to
   medications and therapy. At Air Hollywood, students get the entire
   flying experience over their two day class, even going through a fake
   security line in a fake terminal. Once on a Boeing 757, guest speakers
   talk them through simulated turbulence, and discuss aircraft
   maintenance, engineering, and more. There are other classes available,
   including sessions for children with autism who are afraid to fly, and
   people who travel with their dogs.

   Air Hollywood's owner, Talaat Captan, is aware that on one day a movie
   scene featuring a plane crash is filmed on the lot, and the next a
   class is held to get people over that very fear. "We scare people in
   one building and help them in the other," he said.

[24]White House intruder actually ran through several State Floor rooms
before being tackled

   The armed White House intruder who [25]jumped the fence Sept. 19
   actually made it much farther into the executive residence than had
   previously been reported, [26]The Washington Post revealed. A Secret
   Service spokesman had [27]previously claimed that Omar Jose Gonzalez,
   an Iraq war veteran, had been apprehended by guards just inside the
   front entrance of the White House.

   The Post's new report indicates that rather than being subdued just
   after entering the White House, Gonzalez ran through much of the
   [28]State Floor, cutting through the entry way and East Room before
   being tackled in the doorway of the Green Room. The Post credits "three
   people familiar with the incident" for the information.

[31]Wind turbines are killing more bats than ever

   Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/Getty Images
   Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/Getty Images

   A new study has found that wind turbines are causing "unprecedented
   numbers" of fatalities in tree bats.

   The study, conducted by researchers at the U.S. Geological Survey's
   Fort Collins Center in Colorado and [32]published in PNAS, found that
   tree bats are more susceptible to wind turbine deaths, because the
   turbines' wind current resembles the wind currents surrounding tall
   trees. The bats [33]approach the turbines expecting to find the
   resources they'd find in trees, such as a place to rest or insects to
   eat — and end up dying instead.

   "These bats have been around for millions of years, but nothing in
   their history would prepare them to recognize wind turbines," Paul
   Cryan, a research biologist at the U.S. Geological Survey and author of
   the study, told The Week.

   So, what can we do to reduce the bat fatalities at the turbines? The
   wind turbines already have flashing red lights, which can help bats
   distinguish the turbines from trees, but Cryan's study also found that
   changes in the turbines' operation could reduce bat deaths, too. Most
   of the bat fatalities the researchers observed occurred when average
   windspeeds were lower, though more research is needed to determine why
   this is. Cryan said that fatalities could be reduced by waiting until
   the wind speed is higher to start the turbines' rotation, so the bats
   will be able to sense the turbulence and avoid the turbines.

   Since adult bats reproduce very slowly, their deaths could have lasting
   effects on the species' population. "We know that thousands of bats are
   being found beneath wind turbines each year," Cryan told The Week.
   "These populations may be doing okay, they may be headed toward
   extinction, we simply don't know based on the information we have right
   now."

[35]Aretha Franklin out-divas Adele in roof-raising 'Rolling in the Deep'
cover

   The [36]raw soul! The [37]vocal acrobatics! The [38]back-flip into a
   Motown classic! Aretha Franklin may be 72 years old, but the Queen of
   Soul out-riffs, out-wails, and out-emotes Adele — a woman one-third her
   age — on a cover of the English songstress' 2011 smash hit "Rolling in
   the Deep."

   The cover is part of Franklin's latest album, Aretha Franklin Sings the
   Great Diva Classics — ostensibly a [39]collaboration with André
   3000[40] and Babyface. But for an album premise that practically begs
   the elder stateswoman of divatude to drop all pretense of "reimagining"
   these songs in favor of soul-shaking, window-shattering, spine-tingling
   singing, that is (thankfully) exactly what Franklin does on this, the
   first single off the album.

   Listen to Rolling in the Deep in its entirety below, and pick up the
   full album starting October 21. --Mike Barry

[42]45 dogs dead in North Las Vegas fire

   iStock

   Authorities announced Monday that at least 45 dogs died in a house fire
   in Las Vegas over the weekend.

   The fire was reported to the North Las Vegas Fire Department on Sunday
   night. When the fire department arrived at the home, in a suburb of Las
   Vegas, they found dogs "running in the front and backyards, but most
   were found inside" the three-bedroom home, [43]The Associated Press
   reports.

   While 45 dogs were reported dead, another 48 survived the fire, AP
   notes. Some of the dogs were revived with pet-rescue oxygen masks. In
   addition to the dogs, a man who was at the home [44]was taken to
   University Medical Center in Las Vegas, where he was in stable
   condition as of Monday morning. Meanwhile, animal-control officers
   removed the dogs from the house. It's not yet known why so many animals
   were living there.

   Isaac Barron, a local councilman and high school teacher, who owned the
   house, [45]issued a statement Monday saying he was heartbroken about
   the animals' deaths. Barron added that he had been in the process of
   evicting his tenants, two men who have not yet been identified, from
   the home when the fire occurred. Police Sgt. Chrissie Coon told AP that
   the tenants are under investigation for their treatment of the animals.
   "As an animal lover, I am heartbroken about this tragedy," Barron
   [46]said in the statement. "I hope those responsible are held
   accountable by the authorities."

   North Las Vegas Fire Department Capt. Cedric Williams told AP that
   police will be "continuing their investigation" of the incident, which
   he said appeared to be an accident that resulted from an electrical
   issue. The home, which dated to 1954, was a total loss after the smoke
   damage, Williams told AP.

[48]Man could go to jail for kicking stray cat

   Andre Robinson was arrested after a video of him kicking a stray cat
   several yards was posted on Facebook. He now faces jail time. According
   to the [49]The New York Times, however, "had it been a person he
   kicked, Robinson most likely would have received a quick plea bargain
   requiring no jail time" — if he had been arrested at all.

   "With one seemingly unconsidered kick," the Times reports, Robinson has
   "unwittingly placed himself at the center of an impassioned, growing
   debate" between powerful animal rights activists and lawyers defending
   the accused who "say that punishment in such cases can seem
   disproportionate to the crime when an animal is the victim."

   Animal rights activists show up every time Robinson appears in court in
   Brooklyn, surrounding him and calling for a jail sentence. The FBI has
   begun categorizing animal abuse as a separate crime, and has begun
   taking such cases more seriously.

   Robinson has yet to receive a plea offer from prosecutors, which the
   Times notes is "extremely rare in misdemeanor cases." Robinson faces up
   to a year of jail time if convicted. Read the full story [50]at The New
   York Times.

[51]U.S. grants $450 million to community colleges for job training

   Facebook/Massasoit Community College

   Vice President Joe Biden announced Monday that the United States will
   give $450 million in grants to community colleges that are working with
   employers on job training.

   The U.S. will award the grants to hundreds of community colleges across
   the nation, with the largest grants — roughly $20 million each — going
   to Massasoit Community College in Massachusetts and Chippewa Valley
   Technical College in Wisconsin. [52]The Associated Press reports that
   the jobs initiative underscores the Obama administration's plans to
   improve wages and lower unemployment rates by "linking training to
   industry demand," with the hopes of growing the American economy.

   A significant portion of the grants will be given to training in the
   cybersecurity and IT-related fields, which the White House noted are in
   need of employees. One program in Maryland, for example, will include
   partnerships with Raytheon and IBM to train workers for jobs in
   information technology or cybersecurity. Other fields the White House
   said are [53]in need of employees include healthcare, energy, and
   advanced manufacturing.

[55]GOP Senate candidate Ernst pulling ahead in Iowa

   Facebook/JoniforIowa
   Facebook/JoniforIowa

   A new poll published by the [56]Des Moines Register puts Iowa State
   Senator Joni Ernst (R) six points ahead of Democratic challenger Bruce
   Braley (44-38 percent), while 12 percent of likely voters remain
   undecided.

   Braley has been heavily favored to win the race until just recently,
   and Ernst has made considerable gains since she won her party's
   nomination in June.

   "Just seven months ago," the Register reports, "political analysts
   considered Braley almost a shoo-in for a seat held for 30 years by
   liberal Democrat Tom Harkin."

   Ernst and Braley participated in a [57]heated debate (the first on
   their campaign trail) in which immigration took center stage. Braley
   blamed House Republicans for failing to reform immigration policy,
   while Ernst defended the GOP's anti-amnesty policy.

   Braley is a lawyer who has been a member of Congress for eight years.
   His polling numbers are down in his home district of northeast Iowa,
   where voters take issue with his negligent behavior concerning
   veterans' affairs and his role in crafting ObamaCare.

   Ernst markets herself as a "mother and soldier" and proud native Iowan.
   The consensus of political analysts is that Ernst did well in the
   debate against Braley, who "[58]failed to do her damage." Democrats
   hope to use Ernst's stance against raising the minimum wage to their
   advantage.

   The Iowa race is still very close. The [59]Huffington Post reports that
   models give Ernst a "52 percent chance of winning in November."

[60]This may be the happiest mug shot of all time

   When Michael Whitington was arrested after a bank robbery in Denver, he
   didn't seem too disappointed that he didn't get away with the crime.

   Whitington, 45, has gained national attention after his mugshot went
   viral. In the photo, taken after his arrest on Sept. 23, Whitington is
   grinning ear-to-ear.

   onto a light-rail train. He's been charged with a count of robbery and
   will appear in court Tuesday. Whitington is being held in jail, and

[65]NFL player who killed girlfriend, committed suicide had signs of
degenerative brain disease

   Jovan Belcher, the former Kansas City Chiefs linebacker who killed his
   girlfriend and himself in 2012, had signs of the degenerative brain
   disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. A doctor who
   performed a post-mortem on Belcher at the behest of Belcher's family
   found in his brain a buildup of tau protein, which is associated with
   the disease, [66]according to ESPN's Outside the Lines.

   Neuroscientists believe repeated head trauma dramatically increases the
   risk of CTE, a disease that can lead to depression, memory loss, and
   aggressive behavior. A damning Frontline [67]report last year
   documented the prevalence of CTE in NFL players and the league's
   decades-long denial about the dangers of head trauma.

   In December 2012, Belcher shot and killed his girlfriend, Kasandra
   Perkins. He then drove to the Chiefs' practice facility and, in front
   of team officials, shot himself in the parking lot.
