[8]wonder..

   [9]September 8, 2014September 8, 2014

   All I do is wonder..
   What have I ever done to make you want to tear me down.
   break me, but you did.
   I guess you got what you wanted..
   Youâ€™re fine but me?
   Iâ€™m hurt.
   hurting because of you.
   because of what you did, the lies you told. the lies that felt so
   good.. filling me with things that I loved hearing. filling me with
   life.
   but now, the truth is coming out. It doesnâ€™t fill as good as I
   thought..
   itâ€™s worser.
   itâ€™s all over now and, Iâ€™m fine. I thought iâ€™d die without you. I canâ€™t
   lie and say Iâ€™m not hurt. but Iâ€™m living.

[11]RIPğŸ’”

   [12]August 22, 2014August 23, 2014

   is it impossible to love someone you really didnâ€™t know? I didnâ€™t know
   my uncle but I loved him with all my heart. I also didnâ€™t get to see my
   uncle as much but I still had love for him and I knew he loved me. my
   mom loved my uncle a lot and I could tell, she always talked about him
   and there memories.. Whenever my uncle had a chance he brought me
   things, he always made me laugh and I still remember asking him could
   he buy me some Jordanâ€™s. but thatâ€™s ok. thereâ€™s more to think about
   than just materialistic things..
   May you rest in peace..
   forever & always, carrioneğŸ’˜

   people say love yourself before you love someone else. but what If I
   canâ€™t love myself without loving you. you make me whole.. you complete
   me.

[18]long distance

   [19]July 29, 2014September 2, 2014

   sometimes I lay here and wish you were here. I lay and think about how
   I could roll over and see your face and just smile, forgetting all your
   flaws..
   I lose sleep just to talk to you. I donâ€™t mind, but iâ€™d rather you
   being here with me..
   loving you is the most terrifying thing i have ever put myself through.
   itâ€™s almost crazy that were miles apart. being away from you is tough
   but weâ€™ll get through it..

   but Iâ€™d rather just having you here with me right now.

[21]alone..

   [22]July 29, 2014July 29, 2014

   I hate being by myself. being alone makes me think. and when I have too
   much time I start thinking about how you could leave at any minute.
   How you could just stop putting up with me and just leave, or how you
   could find someone way better than me, then I start to realize how
   alone I really am..

[24]i love the wayâ€¦

   [25]July 29, 2014July 29, 2014

   I love the way you talk, and the things you say.
   I never want anyone else to say it to me unless itâ€™s you.
   I donâ€™t want anyone else to feel the way I feel for you.
   I donâ€™t want anyone to see you the way I see your beautiful face and
   your smile..
   because itâ€™s quite intoxicating and Iâ€™m devouring every minute of it..

[27]pain never looked so good..

   [28]July 17, 2014July 25, 2014

   being depressed makes it feel like your suffocating from your own
   thoughts.
   but me? Iâ€™m jus tired, tired of everything.
   Itâ€™s like a battle between a war;fighting against remembering and
   forgetting.
   and even though you keep a smile on your face, people think your okay.
   when they donâ€™t even know the half of it.. I just want to sleep. get
   away from every human being..
   I feel numb. I donâ€™t feel anything. I look at myself in the mirror and
   all I see is pain.. but Iâ€™m not afraid of dying. pieces of me die all
   the time..
