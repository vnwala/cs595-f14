Greetings From Twitterland

   Reach your audience the new-fashioned way.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Raindance independent film festival This is the ultra secret Twitter
   page that tells me you have arrived from the Raindance Twitter account
   which I started in May 2009. When I started it, I was dreading the
   experience. I didn’t want another item on my daily to-do list. But I’ve
   become a convert and manage the Twitter account myself, along with
   occassional help from the interns.

   I founded Raindance way back in 1992. John Major had just won an
   election for the Tories and Princess Diana was still alive.

   The goal of Raindance was to provide information and advice for film
   and television makers here in Britain. I organised a series of
   workshops and seminars and flew over some of the big names from
   Hollywood. Dov Simens is still coming to London after all these years.

   Soon however, filmmakers started making movies, and back in the early
   ’90′s, there wasn’t a British festival to show them – so I started the
   Raindance Film Festival. In 1995 we had one of the [72]first websites
   of any company in the UK – it was 4 pages long!

   In 1998 I started the [73]British Independent Film Awards which has
   grown to become one of the main event in the British film industry
   year.
   In 2004 I co-founded [74]Raindance Canada
   In 2007 I co-founded [75]Raindance.tv – an IPTV web channel.
   In 2010 we opened offices being in [76]New York, [77]Berlin,
   [78]Brussels and Budapest.
   In 2011 we launched the [79]Raindance Postgraduate Film Degree with
   Staffordshire University and the [80]Independent Film Trust.
   In 2012 we moved into the Raindance Film Centre just off Trafalgar
   Square, developed on Online Postgraduate Film Degree and celebrated the
   20th year of the [81]Raindance Film Festival.

   I couldn’t ever have done any of this without the help and support of a
   great many superbly talented people who work for next-to-nothing on the
   Raindance team.

   Finally, it’s a big thanks to you for reading this. It’s you telling
   your friends about Raindance, RT’ing our Tweets, favouriting our posts
   and sending in your comments that makes me get up in the morning!





   Elliot Grove

The Theory Behind Twitter

   Imagine you are walking down the hallway of your student residence
   hall. You pass a neighbour and say, “what’s up?” and he says,
   “nothing.” Then you keep walking. Later you’re walking through the
   kitchen at work, someone is filling their coffee. “How’re things?” she
   asks. “Busy, but good,” you respond and keep on walking to the
   bathroom.

   If either person hadn’t greeted you, you go back to your dorm room or
   office and wonder, “what happened? why the cold shoulder?” Those small
   bits of conversation are called phatic communication. Alone those bits
   are meaningless, but together they build a relationship. Phatic
   communication keeps the doors open for more communication.

   [82]Get in Touch with me

   You can connect with me personally on [83]Facebook and [84]LinkedIn!
   Raindance Film Festival has a [85]Facebook page. We co-founded a
   registered charity: The Independent Film Trust, which raises money to
   promote and teach filmmaking to the disadvantaged. Please [86]give
   generously.
