[17]Fake

   [18]snakeoil

   [19]HOME

   Can you spot a fake? We are notoriously commenting, Twittering,
   updating, posting, reviewing and spreading bits of information. How on
   earth are we to trust it all?

   What’s worse than a bad review? Or no reviews? Or reviews from a well
   meaning family member?

A FAKE BOOK REVIEW

   Let’s break it down.

   You find a book on Amazon with 2094 reviews. It’s mentioned online in
   popular blogs, ‘news’ articles, maybe even a morning variety show, and
   so forth. All those little stars next to the # of reviews are yellow.
   Hardly any gaps of white (which would indicate bad reviews).

   Then you start reading the reviews. The glowing positive ones
   usually have one thing to say, “lovely”, or “some good advise”, or
   “This book changed my life”, or “You have to get it!”

   See the trend? They rarely describe the meat of the book or why they
   loved it. Trying to fake someone’s excited, glowing opinion is actually
   a lot harder than these ‘scammers’ -(hacks) think.  Some of the five
   star reviews are maybe a paragraph or two long. But they sound like
   they were written by the publisher. Did someone copy the text off the
   back cover?

   Another hint of a possible fake review:  Next to the reviewer’s name
   (many times it’s not a real name), will be the link to See all my
   reviews. Now, how many of those five star, glowing reviewers have
   bought much else? How many of them bought other books in the same
   category? Why are they buying only ONE book about improving your
   career? Why not buy several? Maybe they bought How to Never Work Again
   (I don’t know if this is a real book or not, I just made it up), and
   then bought a pack of dog biscuits and seat belt repair kit?

WHY FAKE A BOOK REVIEW?

   Well, as we all know on Amazon, the more reviews, the higher up in the
   search results your book moves. More reviews = more popularity = your
   book is seen front and center on pages of Amazon.  You, the potential
   buyer, is hooked on all the thousands of reviewers giving the book a 5
   star review. It MUST be good! You want your life changed NOW! (Like it
   promises).

   But perhaps it’s really not good. Or it’s all misdirection. Or it
   promises things and never delivers. Maybe the writing sucks. Maybe it’s
   a snake oil sham. Or maybe it’s a bunch of carefully chosen words and
   sentences to motivate you (but you end up depressed). So obviously, to
   get a bad book some heavy attention and lots of sales, you need to drum
   up some glowing reviews. Sure, there will be some who honestly liked
   the book. But when it comes to self help or career coaching or get rich
   quick – we’ve heard the same old thing over and over and over again.
   The promises get rather familiar. Our brain scours the book waiting,
   hoping for the one tidbit that’s going to provide the “Ah-Ha!” moment.

   When it comes to get rich quick, I have some advice. Here’s what you
   need to do:
     * Write a bad book and get a ton of fake reviews.
     * Get the book mentioned in blogs, social media and saps who actually
       follow the advice but aren’t a success.
     * Find a sugar daddy
     * Play the lottery (you may have to be dirt poor for a very long
       time).
     * Or hope luck will come your way

   Want to really get rich? Be a doctor or lawyer. Or write a book helping
   others avoid the pitfalls of GET RICH QUICK schemes that are so
   artfully hidden in ‘helpful’ books.

   Otherwise, write honest, truthful reviews, ignore the fake ones. If
   you’re like me and have no budget to market a book or lack the morality
   to blast said book in everyone’s face, then you work hard, keep writing
   and plugging away every single day. Yes, weekends too.

[30]The Facebook Option

   [31]The blue pill

   [32]HOME

   Late last night I deleted my personal Facebook account. No, not the one
   associated with my writing. The one associated with my own personal
   life. The one only family and close friends are, well, friend-ed on.

   I had to do a little internet surfing to find out how to delete my
   Facebook account. Facebook doesn’t make it very clear how to close down
   your account and there are two options – take a break from it, or
   actually delete the entire thing. Deleting the whole thing takes time.
   If you log back on in 14 days, your account becomes active again.

   Why go through the trouble to delete a Facebook account? When the real
   question is,

Why should you have a Facebook account at all?

   Part of me is old fashioned. A large part. Human contact trumps all
   other mode of contact. Yes! Face to face speech and eye contact is fast
   becoming extinct and whether or not you want to believe that or agree
   with it, just look at cell phone companies. Major cell phone companies
   now offer plans with unlimited texting and calling minutes. Yet you
   better watch that data package. Going over your data limit may cost
   heavily. The point is that people aren’t calling each other anymore.
   And even texting is too much effort.

   Young people, even the middle aged are ‘communicating’ via Facebook
   posts and comments or Twitter feeds. Instagram and other photo-social
   media platforms would bring up the rear when it comes to communicating.
   Some have turned to Skype or other real time video chat, but believe me
   – it’s not the mass population doing this.

   Back to Facebook. If you are reading this post, you may be in the
   minority. People don’t like to read. They like to interact. That’s why
   human to human direct contact is so satisfying (unless you have a
   disorder, but that’s a topic for another time).

   Reasons I gave up on Facebook (for my personal account):
     * It feels like high school but worse. It’s like a giant clique.
       You’d better post carefully in order to get attention and followers
       of what you say. If you don’t get a response on an update, you
       wonder, “What did I do wrong?” And strange feelings of doubt,
       anger, sadness, confusion, and even narcissism crop up. WHY ISN’T
       ANYONE PAYING ATTENTION TO ME!? My shit is special and everyone is
       ignoring me!! Whoops. Then you realize you’ve become one of those
       ‘drama people’ that everyone else complains about by using memes
       (which I hate). Have a feeling? Then say it darnit, don’t put up a
       meme with a dumb photo and poem.
     * I worry about all that information I’m posting….what I’m doing,
       when, how, why. Is someone going to find an old post of a glass of
       wine I was drinking and call me an alcoholic? Is someone, one day,
       going to find a rant I wrote and label me bipolar? The future legal
       implications are vast. I’m not willing to put my personal life on
       display anymore – yet that is the #1 rule of Facebook: GET
       PERSONAL.
     * Data mining. Never heard of this? Google it then and come back and
       ask me if I’m paranoid for good reason. Yes, the NSA, and every
       other private and governmental institution is following me and you
       and taking notes. The real fun begins when the notes become
       evidence, cataloged and stored, only to be recalled when useful.
     * Facebook will convince you that your own life sucks. It is dripping
       with updates of your high school friend showing off her sexy new
       husband and the insanely cute child they created. It shows you that
       the boyfriend that took you to the prom is now happily married and
       has a great job. It makes you compare the body you have tried to
       sculpt, mold, craft through running 25 miles per week, eating only
       salads and visiting a gym every day, to a friend who constantly
       takes selfies in her bikini and has like 4 kids and no stretch
       marks. You suddenly feel the urge to visit a plastic surgeon. You
       decide you look ugly because you have blooming grey hair and
       everyone else is blond and fabulous. Everyone else has awesome cars
       but yours is 21 years old and looks like a piece of sh**. You can’t
       help but wrestle with a new found envy and jealousy - which is the
       furthest thing that ever used to cross your personality.
     * Trolls. And I’m not talking about those crazy fat nerds that sit on
       a computer all day with pizza crust collections on the edges of
       their desk and the interior of their house is so dark it dwarfs
       black holes in the cosmos. I’m talking about the kind of trolls
       that look like you and me, or a housewife with cute curly blond
       hair and updates about the awesome deal she got on QVC – a glittery
       lamp in the shape of a tree that uses half a battery to operate.
       Suddenly she comes out of nowhere and SLAMS you for stating your
       opinion. Kohls suddenly infects your Facebooks feed with an
       ‘advertisement’ (you never liked Kohl’s page in the first place)
       about some butt ugly dolls you can have if you spend $75 bucks at
       their store. They claim they are going to give you a doll and
       donate to charity. But – the dolls are LAME. Not worth $75 of
       clothing you really didn’t want to buy anyway but convinced
       yourself to do so. And Kohl’s  won’t tell you exactly which charity
       they might send .0001% of a your purchase to. Suddenly the curly
       haired, QVC shopper strikes and tells you for all the world to see
       on FB that you are a horrid person for not liking these dolls and
       you are pond scum, refusing to donate to a worthy cause, and that
       your opinion should be only used on THINGS THAT MATTER. Suddenly
       you (me) are labled a HATER, a degenerate, the lowest of the low
       and you are nearly gang raped and beat up on in cyberspace. All for
       voicing an opinion on Kohl’s dolls that are made in some Chinese
       sweat shop, look grotesque and it is so gimmicky you are shocked
       that anyone would fall for such a stupid ploy. You are ATTACKED.
     * I actually felt more lonely on Facebook than not doing it at
       all.” In a healthy social life, there is no room for Facebook,
       because when you are an active participant in the lives of those
       you love, social media has nothing to offer you.” [33]Hat tip.
       That’s just it. Facebook is a FALSE MECHANISM. It does not really
       gain you true insight into other people or into the lives of those
       you hold most dear. In fact, it really reinforces the fact that we
       are all very much alone on this planet. We have to work at it to
       get along and come together. Facebook is convincingly deceptive
       that we are all interconnected online and in life. There is much
       more to life outside of Facebook.
     * Addiction. I was trying to date a new guy while living in Montana.
       When he finally ‘made time for me’ and came over to my house. All
       he did was sit on the couch, and do his Facebook app on his phone.
       Meanwhile anytime my eyes glanced over, he shrouded his phone so I
       couldn’t see. I tried later adding him as a friend, but he lied
       saying he never goes on Facebook. Well, maybe Facebook actually
       helped me out this time. I learned quite quickly that this guy was
       a total PLAYER. And he used Facebook to find the next best thing.
       Which wasn’t me. But guys (and I assume girls) are so wrapped up in
       updating and posting, they don’t give any attention to what’s
       happening in real life. How are relationships supposed to get off
       the ground this way? I have to put Facebook in the category of
       ADDICTION. If you can’t go out to dinner or your potential
       girlfriend’s house without constantly checking your Facebook
       account – something is really wrong with you.
     * Scammers are making fake profiles and trying to ‘friend you’. If
       you have 1589 friends, how on earth do you know that each one of
       them are true and not a hacker or scammer, recording everything you
       do. Or worse, a stalker. Maybe your abusive ex-boyfriend has
       disguised himself as someone else and is slowly winning your
       attention and affection. Ever see MTV’s Catfish show? Facebook is
       THE main way these ‘Catfish’ operate.

   Oh and I could go on and on. Even if you use Facebook only for
   promotion for a business or product. All it take is ONE negative
   comment or an unhappy customer to start spreading rumors and lies. You
   might find yourself shut down, business destroyed and dream
   disintegrated. Be careful. Facebook can be a very effective weapon and
   a tyrant when it wants.

[44]Leaving

   [45]P1300458

   Above image is the state flower of Montana, the Bitterroot.

   [46]HOME

   I planned on living in Montana forever. But in 12 days I am moving back
   to the Silver State. There are worse areas to live than Nevada. I’ve
   lived in some of them. But the decision was made with a heavy heart and
   resistant mind to leave Big Sky Country.

   I tend to fall in love with nature. The land. The weather, the
   environment and extremes are really quite thrilling to me. There is a
   slight midwestern friendliness here in the capitol city but less so in
   more populated areas of Montana. I will miss the greetings from
   complete strangers and frequent but random acts of kindness. I keep
   telling myself that one day I will return and buy a ranch and raise
   horses. Yet Nevada is known for wild mustangs and there definitively is
   a lot more horseback riding and equine opportunities.

   With most of my family, some aging and some ill, situated in California
   I knew what my ultimate decision would be some time ago. I am more
   mobile than they are. And that mobility doesn’t come easy with two
   active Labs. Oh yes there are other factors – the lack of clean,
   affordable rentals in Montana, good hospitals and extreme weather means
   being indoors a lot. Yes I fought through negative 40 degrees and
   played in the snow, burnt off my face, lost feeling in my fingers and
   plowed a steep 500 foot driveway covered in snow. But I’ve also given
   up hiking, bike riding, running, bowling, swimming, inline skating, a
   leisurely walk with my dogs without carrying some serious self defense.

   Nevada has it’s downsides too. But I was never chased by a deer and
   left struggling to breathe due to acute asthma exacerbation in the
   emergency room. I never dealt with a prowling Mountain Lion around my
   house. I never had to get permission to set foot on a trail or open
   piece of land. Much of the BLM in Montana is hard to get to and
   figuring out where private property meets public land is tough. Access
   to BLM up the road from me is protected at the entrance by big NO
   TRESPASSING signs. And the one accessible public shore area to swim
   safely on the Missouri River in Helena is controlled by BLM nazi people
   that smell like they smoke 30 packs a day.

   Neighbors are fickle in Montana. I can’t express how many people I’ve
   met who are born and raised here yet don’t even know their neighbors or
   their first names. In the last two years here I’ve watched some big
   national chain stores crop up, while locals shake their head and call
   these businesses “too fancy for Montana”. Yet I see fancy cars all over
   the place and small homes selling for $400,000. I think Montana is
   going through some growing pains unfortunately. They didn’t experience
   much strife during the housing market demise or recession. Employment
   in Helena hovers around 3.8% yet most of the jobs are part time or low
   wage. It’s commonplace to work two jobs. The poor are everywhere. I see
   one homeless man standing on the way out of Walmart constantly with a
   cardboard sign that says, Smile, it could always be worse.

   Without delving into all the negatives about Big Sky Country, it’s time
   for me to move on and leave. I need to pack a few more boxes and sell
   off some more furniture.

   Could the real reason I’m leaving is to return to the sparkling glacial
   rock that inspired my first romance novel, White Rock? Yes, perhaps.
   Nevada has granite beneath all the shifting debris of the high desert.
   But very close to the western edge of where the grand Sierras meet the
   Great Basin is a stretch of rock that I cannot resist any longer. It
   calls to me. It’s magnetic and mysterious.

   Leaving is hard stuff. Returning isn’t easy either but all I can say
   now is that I’m glad I moved to Montana and I’m a lot tougher because
   of it. Perhaps one day again I will gaze upon the emerald sea of the
   great plains with sheer awe and disbelief as I always do. Maybe the
   Northern Rockies will welcome me back with a rush of sweet breezes and
   subtle nod to come get fully lost in a land that is truly wild.

[56]Gaslighting

   [57]P1260196

   [HOME]

   Have you ever felt manipulated? Let me re-phrase that: Have you ever
   had that feeling that something is wrong but you are so confused and
   doubting every other thought that crosses your mind that you begin to
   wonder if you’re going insane?

   Welcome to gaslighting. I’m highlighting this topic today because I’ve
   been through it myself but also the main antagonist in White Rock is a
   skilled gaslighter, or master manipulator.

   Think it can’t happen to you? Guess again. It’s often hard to recognize
   at first in a relationship. Left unchecked it can do some serious harm
   and long term disruption. It’s slightly different than just an
   overbearing or controlling person. Gaslighting is often hard to
   pinpoint and happens over time. Not like a big fight. It’s very
   intangible. Other people in your life may chalk it up to something
   else. The gaslighter or manipulator has convinced you of an alternate
   reality. Oh, you may come up for air sometimes and see that something
   is really wrong, or even assert what you know to be the truth. But if
   the manipulator has his or her hooks deep into your psyche, and it’s
   been going on for some time, it may be very hard to identify the
   situation.

   Wikipedia coins gaslighting as a form of abuse. And since I’ve been
   through it myself, I would heartily agree.

   In a nut shell, the manipulator creates doubt, unease and the victim is
   lead carefully into a world lacking self confidence. It can go as far
   as the victim thinking they really are mentally insane, therefore they
   need to rely on the manipulator since they are convinced that their own
   functioning, reasoning and beliefs are wrong and faulty.

   Of course gaslighting can be extreme or subtle. It can come in layers
   or waves.

   In White Rock, Kris has seen the negative influence Adam has had on
   her. His charms and delusional tactics  that kept her so blinded to all
   his other faults are not enough for her to stay with him. But when Kris
   asserts herself and starts seeing someone new, Adam is unable to let
   go.  As many manipulators are, he is patient to win over his prize. The
   darker side of him that is nearly out of control is contained by
   another obsession. By biding his time anopportunity arises to get Kris
   back.  I don’t go to far with the gaslighting tactics in White Rock,
   but the sequel will demonstrate how and why such a crazy, evil
   character can keep someone psychologically hostage.

   So this type of sociopath – charming and unassuming – are really
   accomplished liars. They aren’t stupid, although they may come off so
   arrogant that the target individual may chalk them up to an idiot with
   low intelligence. The gaslighter may be highly gifted in the powers of
   persuasion, falsifying, suspending belief and creating an atmosphere of
   doubt but they may lack true empathy and compassion, although with
   selflessness.

   The gaslighting individual relishes the power he has over his victim.
   It soothes and satiates for awhile but usually it is never enough. They
   may be struggling with addiction, mental disorders or even something as
   extreme as the need for committing serial and horrific acts and crimes.

   Kris might seem insecure at times. I wrote her that way on purpose. She
   often feels confused and doubts honest intentions by those close to
   her. At times she shuts down, which is almost likened to a mode of self
   preservation. I touch on some of this with the first book, but I take a
   deeper look at gaslighting in White Rock II (sequel unnamed as of right
   now).

   Google Gaslighting for a bigger picture of what it is. Or check out an
   [58]article in Psychology Today.

[67]Who Has All the Answers?

   [68]WP_20131026_03820131026185456-001

   The internet is a great phenomenon. Do you use Wikipedia to look stuff
   up? This may have you taking a step back.

   [69]Up to six in ten articles on Wikipedia contain inaccuracies
   according to new research.

   or

   [70]another article here…

   I admit I blindly trust Wikipedia on a vast majority of topics. I never
   question it’s validity. But I began wondering after I read the above
   articles. Would the same mistakes happen in a hard copy
   Encyclopedia Britannica? Maybe not, because there is a lot more editing
   and fact checking before publishing a book rather than a website. But
   it sure is a lot harder to update a physical encyclopedia than
   Wikipedia.

   I still turn to the Physician’s Desk Reference to look up drug
   interactions and side effects rather than Drugs.com or rxlist.com. The
   PDA used to be a published manual. A huge, heavy book with tiny print.
   It was THE reference for pharmacists. I know this because my dad was a
   pharmacist for 32 years. It’s accuracy and wealth of information far
   surpasses the misunderstandings found on the web.

   Who, then, has all the answers? Where do we go to find the truth? An
   iPhone app? Amazon.com? Blogs. Twitter feed. A friend. The answer isn’t
   really clear. But what I’m getting at is that the answers that you find
   these days usually come electronically off the web, which may be a
   rather unreliable source or something we don’t question.

   When it comes to self publishing and writing there is a LOT of opinion
   but very few tangible facts. I admit freely I Google all the time, “how
   to make money with self publishing”, “how to be a better writer”, “how
   to get more reviews”, “how, how, how, when, why…” My searches turn up
   blogs that SEEM helpful but are really advertising ploys. They haven’t
   helped me at this point. Or, some have but the help was so small I
   wonder if plowing and rummaging through so much signing up, and GET MY
   FREE PODCAST NOW  (laden with incessant talk about nothing of
   substance), perhaps the tiny grain of useful information was just an
   enormous waste of my time.

   I’ve come to some conclusions based on wasting a lot of time trying to
   find self publishing answers:

   There is no magic way to get a bunch of reviews unless you have a bag
   of money.

   There is no pot of gold at the end of the self publishing rainbow.

   There is no entity that will selflessly take your hand and walk you
   through it all.

   The only way to be a better writer is study writing, learn, write, and
   read. If you still don’t get it, maybe writing isn’t your gift or
   fortee. I love to sing. But I suck as a singer. I took vocal classes. I
   still sucked. I can play just about any wind or keyed instrument you
   put in front of me but cover your ears if I’m on the drums or guitar.

   My point is we all have avenues we excel in. Maybe you are a good
   writer, but not great. Maybe I’m a good writer but not great. Maybe I’m
   a better storyteller. Maybe I’m a better illustrator.

   Perhaps nobody has all the answers and nobody ever will. You know on
   the deep interior corners of your mind how to get the good information
   you seek. It takes effort and time. You can choose to believe my
   answers or ignore them completely. See how that works?

   Lastly I wonder if maybe some answers are true for some people but not
   other people. People search out the answers mainly to confirm what they
   already know. And maybe it’s a total waste of time to find the answers
   to some questions. It’s one thing to watch a YouTube video on how to
   change your oil. It’s another to watch a long seminar with some dude
   that needs a large does of Ritalin for his ADHD, telling you how to
   market a book.

   I could of written 6,000 words while the maniac yipped and yapped to
   get his TRIED AND TRUE method across. What kind of answer is that?

[79]What’s Wrong With Pursuing Dreams?

   [80]Blazing Star 8/25/2013. 5260 Peak's View Drive, Helena, MT

   I’m here to scream there is nothing wrong with it. Yes your life might
   be diffucult or limited to live out those dreams depending on what they
   are. But maybe, just maybe you can make them happen. If you suspend
   common criticism and the belief that we all need to have a crappy 9-5
   job, big house, nice car, white picket fence, blah, blah, blah, 2.5
   kids and a dog laying in front of the fireplace, perhaps if you suspend
   what you think is expected of your life, you will see the bigger
   picture.

   I’m not knocking the average life. I admire people who put all their
   effort and time into job and family. I do it too, but just differently.

   Dreams have a funny way of creeping up in the back of your head and
   reminding you they are still there. They don’t want to be squashed
   entirely. Whether those dreams are living naked on an island in the
   Caribbean or making it to the top of a Fortune 500 company, dreams
   aren’t silly. They are there for a reason. And sometimes you can live
   those dreams and find out they weren’t as satisfying as you thought. Or
   maybe along the way in trying to achieve the dream, you take a side
   step and go in a different direction. More doors open up and thing
   start to happen.

   I think when you pursue dreams you are taking a risk. And these days
   with our economy, and uncertain times, taking risks is equated with
   stupidity. How flagrant you are! Really? Or maybe taking a risk is
   necessary. To stay one step ahead of the monotony, the downturn, the
   dark times. Maybe you can continue on with life as you know it right
   now but change some minuscule thing that will lead to living out a
   dream you never thought possible.

   Decide to pursue your dreams or not. Whatever calls to you is personal
   and not a bad decision. It’s your life.

[89]The Very First Page

   [90]P1070324-001

   Don’t waste an obvious opportunity to make an impression.

   Bella Andre doesn’t. Web site, links to social media, etc. Use that
   very first page of your book to let the reader know where else they can
   find you or how to connect.

   There’s a fine line obviously of yammering on too much. You don’t want
   to overdose your potential reader. They’ll get sick, gulp down some
   asprin, skip dinner and go to bed without reading your works at all.

   I was a little quirky with the revamp of [91]The Everyday Zombie
   Handbook.
   [92]firstpage

   The re-done first page of my zombie book for Kindle.


   I stated the revision date. I placed a little logo, which is also seen
   further on in the book (visual cues, very important!). I politely asked
   the reader to leave a review OR contact me at my site. I don’t bite —>
   a little play on words since the book is about zombies.

   So make that first readable page memorable. Different. And perhaps you
   need to do a revision later on just to post updated information on the
   first page, or some other useful content.

[101]I’m Taking the Difficult Path

   [102]OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA

   Use Your Imagination.

   To the left is a long winding trail lined with overgrown thorny plants
   and poisonous snakes (doomsday folk), ready to strike. But in the
   distance you see a big shining castle poking through the clouds,
   sitting right on the edge of a sparkling sea. It’s really where you
   want to be. It calls to you. You imagine  the salt air rushing over
   your weary face. You stare down at the snakes slithering around, ready
   to thwart your attempt at getting past, getting to your destination,
   achieving your goal. You wonder if it will be worth it.

   To the right (no political pun intended), is another trail that looks
   pretty straight forward, nicely paved, fresh flowers lining the sides.
   There doesn’t seem to be any danger at all. There’s even some fat
   little bakers handing out free cupcakes with cherries on top along the
   way. You are overwhelmed and drawn to such pretty things and lack of
   life threatening creatures that you don’t bother to see where the trail
   even goes. In fact all you see is a bunch of rain clouds in the
   distance. But that’s good right? Rain makes the flowers grow. But it
   also makes the weeds grab hold as well.

Which path do you take?

   I’ll tell you which one I’m on right now. The one with snakes. Here’s
   why. If I took the easy road the end result looks rather ominous and
   unsure. What’s behind the clouds? Salvation? Promises? I don’t know. I
   look at that shining castle sitting on the edge of a sparkling sea. I
   can’t tell how long the path is or how messed up I’m going to get
   trying to make my way but I’m already starting to beat off the snakes
   (dooms day people) with a couple of those thorny branches I snapped
   off. Yeah, there is a possibility I won’t make it. But what if I do?
   What’s left if I don’t? Cleaning houses?

   Time is the ultimate factor here. I’m speaking to you from my heart and
   my brain. Give your works time. Don’t expect a quick road to that
   castle by the sea. You are braver than you think. Don’t listen to those
   serpents and naysayers. Why do they feel the need to give us their dose
   of reality anyway? We aren’t trying to live their life by their rules.
   Yes life is hard. We get that. Yes being a writer is tough. If you
   don’t think it is then maybe you SHOULD fear the snakes and go the
   other direction.

   I’ve decided. I will make it to that castle. There may not be silk
   sheets and servants catering to my every whim but I don’t want that
   anyway. So hurry up. I’ll meet you there.

[111]The Elusive Review

   [112]I do that every morning before my contacts are in.

   Unfortunately people want some type of confirmation before purchasing
   anything these days. Why unfortunate? I think by being so overly
   dependent on what other entities think of a certain product, movie or
   book, we fail to take risks. We stay in the mainstream, never deviating
   from the path. Never discovering new things. Stuff that opens our eyes,
   challenges our thoughts.

What works for one may not for another.

   I have purchased a great many things off Amazon based off glowing
   reviews. I ignored the few negative reviews. What transpired was a
   situation that had me wishing I’d saved my money and never read a
   review in the first place. Stuff that broke. Didn’t perform. Dare I say
   total crap that was reviewed as, “Amazing!” “Wonderful vacuum!” “The
   most amazing movie I’ve ever seen!!”. I was left shaking my head
   wondering who these reviewers were and why the hell did I trust them?

   There are too many choices. But not enough good ones. I recently bought
   a Brita filter because that’s all Walmart had. They were out of PUR –
   which I really wanted. But Brita pitchers were stacked everywhere.
   Different models. Different sizes. Different kits. I didn’t want Brita
   though. Now I hate the thing. The lid won’t stay on and it dumps water
   all over the counter half the time.

The upside to reviews.

   I was really, really going to buy Fifty Shades of Gray. I was
   intrigued. It was getting a TON of reviews. My cousin was reading it
   while on an extended stay in Costa Rica. I thought, hey, I’m an
   aspiring romance novelist and have read my fair share of erotic
   fiction. Then I took a closer look at these reviews:
   [113]review

   Capture of actual review from Amazon.com
   [114]review2

   Capture of another review on Amazon.com about Fifty Shades of Grey

   And then….these reviews…

   [115]review3

   [116]review4

   [117]review5
   As for 2014 reviews, it’s a mixed bag. Some good, some not. The average
   consensus seems to be that it’s a porn book that isn’t for everyone. I
   might have purchased it except for the overwhelming amount of bad
   reviews and talk of how badly the book is written. Why would I want to
   waste my time on bad writing? Of course that’s taking the reviewer’s
   opinion as truth. All in all my time is precious and I am glad I didn’t
   buy the book and read it. Instead I took some notes on what NOT to do
   in my own writing.

   Whether you slightly notice reviews or put a lot of faith in them, I
   think they are precarious and we place too much importance on them.
   Unfortunately books don’t sell without a plethora of reviews, (bad or
   good). Reviews get people talking.

Then why do indie authors have such a hard time obtaining a review?

   My educated guesses are -
     * Regular readers want the promise of a good story, good writing and
       satiation. They develop a lot of emotion and devotion to a favorite
       author. Trying out a new one isn’t always on their list of things
       to do.
     * The book is ranked #4,595,3023 on Amazon. How on earth is the
       casual online shopper going to find it?
     * Their book sucks. (I hope mine doesn’t but anything is possible.)
     * The self published market is flooded and overflowing with ebooks.
       Many have jumped on the bandwagon. I saw a children’s book the
       other day that was shocking. Really. Someone used the shape tool
       with a bad paint program on their computer to make the dumbest
       looking creatures I could ever think of. It wasn’t done by a kid
       either. Hello? It had many 5 star reviews! The story had no plot,
       no point, no significance at all! What am I missing here people?
     * [Deep sigh.]
     * But it’s a free country and if you have an idea by all means,
       create, publish, write, promote. Do what you must. Do what compels
       you. I just hope people have some ethics and morality not to badger
       their friends and family¹ for fake-ish, glowing reviews. Or worse,
       actually write fake ones about their own stuff. (I’m only observing
       here…because what else explains a sea of 5 star reviews on
       something my dog could do better?). I wonder if this almost brings
       down the validity of reviews overall. Fake reviews punish real,
       well thought out reviews.
     * We’re a busy society. Work. Kids. Car trouble. Bad weather. Family
       dinner. Maybe people read a book they LOVED and just didn’t
       remember to write a review. I love John Steinbeck but I have never
       reviewed any of his books. Same with J.K. Rowling. (I’m too busy
       writing blogs, tweets, books….). But I do try and review from time
       to time, especially authors that aren’t as well known.
     * Maybe your indie book was so bad the customer didn’t want to tell
       you.
     * Maybe you indie book was so good the customer didn’t want to be the
       only one leaving a review. Maybe they weren’t sure about being the
       only reviewer. (Insecurity issues?) Or is it a popularity contest?
       Nobody else reviewed it so I don’t want to waste my time here.
       Oops, I forgot what I even read about.
     * You get the picture.

To sum up.

   That first real review you have been waiting for seems strangely
   elusive. You poured so much time, effort, hard work, re-writes,
   editing, proof reading into the darn thing, and yet no reward of just a
   nice glowing review at the end of this journey. Sometimes I think the
   more friends you have, especially on FB, the better off you are. The
   more people talk about what you’ve created will obviously  generate
   some interest in your book. Or not. I told my friends but only one read
   it. (Thank you!) But what about that review from an independent source?
   Where is THAT review? Even better – a positive review from a
   distinguished source like say NPR books, or gasp, the NY Times?!  Well,
   one can only dream, right?

   ¹ Undoubtedly family and friends will want to review your book out of a
   sense of obligation or support. Some say these reviews don’t count but
   at least they took the time to do it.
