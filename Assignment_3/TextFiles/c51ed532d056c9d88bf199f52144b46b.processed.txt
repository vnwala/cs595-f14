THE MARSCHER LORDS

   [Medieval_Knight02.jpg]

   THE MARSCHER LORDS tells a tale familiar to each one of us since time
   began: Where does the line of duty, love, or devotion divide us from
   our family? And if there is a divide within that family, what are the
   consequences? This is a story about boldness and courage and how far is
   one willing to take it. This story is something everyone of us has
   lived at some point in our lives. Families grow together, split apart,
   then (hopefully) come back together again. Who do you trust when in
   need? Who do you go to when disaster looms? Do you even dare go to them
   being that they are members of your own family? This is a story that's
   as old as time. It is a story about the ages for the ages.

   WHAT IS THIS FILM ABOUT? In times of imminent danger, do we look out
   for ourselves or others? Within each and every one of us is that very
   eternal conflict, that inner struggle between living up to our
   responsibilities or protecting our own material goods? THE MARSCHER
   LORDS is the story of two brothers caught in the maelstrom of the
   Barbarian Invasions of Europe during the 13th Century. Maxim von
   Marscher and his adopted brother Petrus meet for the first time in
   several years. Maxim - as a member of the Teutonic Order - has been
   away at war while Petrus has expanded his Nobility in the land of their
   birth, becoming a very high, respected, and influential Lord. Maxim
   informs his brother that the Barbarian Hordes quickly approach and that
   haste must be made to get the innocent and women and children out of
   harm's way; not to do so is tantamount to a death sentence. However
   Petrus's main concern is that of the landed estates and their contents
   and how best to secure their property from the advancing enemy. The two
   brothers - hitherto very close - quickly find themselves at an impasse
   as precious time ticks away.

   HOW THE PROJECT CAME TO BE? The principal actors - Edwin Bravo (Petrus)
   & Robert E Wilhelm (Maxim) have a long history working together, both
   on camera and on the stage. Shakespeare and the classics help mold them
   as actors and they are passionate about both, having performed such
   works as Richard III, Julius Caesar, and Henry V both on the stage and
   in free public forums.  Both wanted to do something in a classic vein
   here, but felt it should be something original. Thus THE MARSCHER LORDS
   was borne, which Wilhelm wrote (and - as an avid historian - of course
   exhaustively researched the project beforehand).  A produced playwright
   (his original works My Kind of Girl & Learning to Fly were produced by
   the venerable Stanley Ralph Ross in Studio City, CA). His historical
   expertise has been profiled on such shows as Spike TV's Deadliest
   Warrior and in books (his novel of historical fiction [3]All the Iron
   Men can be found on amazon.com). Edwin Bravo has been seen in such
   shows as Sons of Tucson, Supah Ninja, Hawaii Five-O, and Harry's Law.
   This is a timeless story as poignant today as it was then. The response
   to the script has been overwhelmingly positive and has afforded us the
   opportunity to assemble an exceptional - as well as seasoned -
   production team. One of the most beautiful and natural areas of the
   California coastline will be utilized for this production. It is - in a
   word - breathtaking.

Robert E. Wilhelm

Writer/Director/Actor

(Maxim)

   Robert began his adventures into the drama realm in his hometown of
   Annapolis, Maryland, literally on a dare when he auditioned for a local
   production of Neil Simon's Biloxi Blues, where he was cast as Eugene
   Jerome's eternal nemesis Wykowski. After cutting his teeth in theatre
   productions in Annapolis/Baltimore area, he ventured to Los Angeles and
   began honing his edge under the sharp eye of director/teacher Sal Romeo
   of the Friends & Artists Theatre Ensemble. He has since studied with
   Bobby Chance and Scott Columby. His experience includes live
   Shakespeare as well as a host of short films, including Red Cape
   Cinema's ([5]www.redcapecinema.com) fan favorite WWII: Balance of
   Power. A military historian and scuba diver since the tender age of
   twelve, Wilhelm recently found an outlet for all by working currently
   on two upcoming original series: Masters of War: Soldiers of
   Distinction & Diver Down! Recently he was a guest expert on the
   highly-rated Spike TV smash Deadliest Warrior. An accomplished author
   (his novel [6]All the Iron Men can be found on Amazon.com) as well as
   produced playwright; his original works My Kind of Girl & Learning To
   Fly were produced by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences alumni
   Stanley Ralph Ross in Los Angeles at Studio City's Theatre East. A
   sample series intro and other works can be seen over at
   [7]www.quarterdeckent.com. Most recently Wilhelm worked with director
   Michael Bay on T3. Wilhelm is repped by the renowned Jack Scagnetti
   Agency.

Stephen Rollins

Producer



   Stephen’s professional background includes appearing in over 40 movies
   and television series as an actor, most recently appearing as a teacher
   on the Fox television series “Glee”. Stephen’s love for sports,
   particularly baseball and hockey, also came into play. In addition to
   his work in film and television entertainment, Stephen began a
   professional hockey career. An unfortunate injury ended his hockey
   career, and he then turned his attention full time to a film and
   television career. In 2001, Stephen returned to the film industry as a
   producer. Following the events of 9/11, he wrote, produced, and
   directed the 30 minute short film, American Identity, which pays
   tribute to the victims of that day, as well as our nation’s military.
   The film led to remarkable premiere events at the Cannes Film Festival,
   and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences. The film opened new
   eyes to Stephen and his career, and continues to present new
   opportunities for him. In February 2012, Stephen entered the 2012
   presidential race as an independent candidate. Touring the country,
   meeting fellow citizens, his spirit was renewed by the passion of the
   people. In January 2013, Stephen founded the “National Foundation for
   Military Family Support”, a charity specifically to assist our troops
   and their families with medical, mental, and legal assistance and
   support.

   Charles E. Santacrose
   Writer/Executive Producer
                               Film Dedicated
                           -IN MEMORY OF CHARLES-
   January 29, 1953 to August 30, 2013
   Sadly, we lost a very important part of our production team recently,
   Charles Edward Santacrose, age 60 of Winnetka, CA passed away August
   30. This native of Endicott, NY often worked as a field recruiter for
   Nielsen Research. For Nielsen Charles recruited test audiences,
   assisted focus groups and prepared reports to film industry clients.
   These duties honed a key insight for what audiences would respond to.
   He turned this expertise into an multi-award winning short film "The
   Angel", in which he handled the reigns of Executive Producer. Charles
   was particular about what his name was attached to, and he looked far
   and wide before settling on another film project to do. When he did, it
   was The Marscher Lords: Brotherhood or Death, and it was one he was
   very passionate about. When Charles saw talent in someone or a project,
   he would intensively labor to see that individual or that project
   become a success. That was his intent with The Marscher Lords:
   Brotherhood or Death before his illness intervened. We are going to
   miss him dearly, Charles was a good man and great friend to many.
   Always offering to help his friends but rarely asking for anything in
   return. He will be with us in spirit and we are dedicating this project
   to him in Memorial. May God rest your soul and Christ Jesus bring you
   peace. here's the link to The Angel youtube video:
