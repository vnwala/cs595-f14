   All that lot should give you:
   A prompt to select the file you want to calculate the hash of
   Open Dialog
   The hash result
   Hash Result
   And then, if you supply a hash and click the Compare button, it’ll say
   either
   Match Success Match Failure

   Now I’m sure there are PowerShell gurus out there that could have all
   this done in 4 lines of code but it was a learning experience so the
   code is always likely to be a little more verbose than is absolutely
   necessary.

   Feel free to use the code but plug me as a source if you’re going to
   use the code on your own blog if you wouldn’t mind.

[17]HTML5 Canvas Scaling

   [18]Wed 2nd April, 2014 [19]Lewis [20]Leave a comment

   Recently I’ve had some time to fettle with things other than
   Infrastructure and Windows servers so I’ve decided to do [21]my company
   website with HTML 5. It’s nothing special but as part of my tinkering,
   I created a new logo and I thought it’d be cool to re-create it in
   HTML5 Canvas so it was unique and somewhat versatile.

   The process starts out as quite a difficult task. How on earth do you
   re-create a logo by drawing some lines? Well, to cut a long story
   short, I opened it up in my favourite vector drawing app (the one I
   used to create it) and just copied the x,y coordinates of the anchor
   points on to an HTML5 canvas that was the same size as the artboard the
   illustration was on.

   First you’ll need a canvas element on your HTML5 page. Something like:

   Pay attention to the width and height declarations since this is the
   canvas size (in pixels) you’re drawing on.
<canvas id="logo" height="102" width="102">Browser says no...&lt;canvas&gt;</can
vas>

   The end result is pretty cool. All of this:

function drawLogo(target) {
var element = document.getElementById(target);
var canvas = element.getContext("2d");

/*
Originally drawn on 102px x 102px canvas (it wouldn't go smaller without distort
ing!)
Use this scale (the original canvas size)
to calculate the appropriate scaling values for
the intended target canvas.
*/

var oScaleY = 102;
var oScaleX = 102;

canvas.scale ((element.width / oScaleX), (element.height / oScaleY)); //Scale th
e canvas to fit the canvas object's width height.

canvas.beginPath();

canvas.moveTo(5, 4); // Starting Point
canvas.lineTo(5, 30);
canvas.lineTo(23, 30);
canvas.lineTo(23, 40);
canvas.lineTo(5, 40);
canvas.lineTo(5, 66);
canvas.lineTo(23, 66);
canvas.lineTo(23, 77);
canvas.lineTo(5, 77);
canvas.lineTo(5, 103);
canvas.lineTo(90, 103);
canvas.lineTo(98, 90);
canvas.lineTo(90, 77);
canvas.lineTo(79, 77);
canvas.lineTo(79, 66);
canvas.lineTo(84, 66);
canvas.lineTo(92, 53);
canvas.lineTo(84, 40);
canvas.lineTo(79, 40);
canvas.lineTo(79, 30);
canvas.lineTo(92, 30);
canvas.lineTo(100, 17);
canvas.lineTo(92, 4);

canvas.closePath();

// Seemingly the gradient size must be based on the original drawn canvas.
var grad = canvas.createLinearGradient(0,oScaleX,0,0);

grad.addColorStop(0, "rgb(46,92,139)");
grad.addColorStop(0.25, "rgb(0,113,188)");

canvas.fillStyle = grad; // Set the gradient as the fill colour.

canvas.fill(); // Fill the closed path (with the gradient)

canvas.fillStyle = "rgb(255,255,255)"; // Set a new fill colour (white)
canvas.fillRect(29, 30, 44, 10); // Create a filled (white) rectangle.

canvas.beginPath();

canvas.moveTo(29, 66);
canvas.lineTo(29, 77);
canvas.lineTo(64, 77);
canvas.lineTo(64, 81);
canvas.lineTo(73, 81);
canvas.lineTo(73, 62);
canvas.lineTo(64, 62);
canvas.lineTo(64, 66);

canvas.closePath();

canvas.fill();
}

drawLogo("logo"); // Actually draw the logo


   Gives you something looking like this:

   Anyway, I’m not here to teach you how to re-create my company logo in
   HTML5, needless to say, that’s what it looks like. The JavaScript
   function above does some clever scaling so if your intended target
   HTML5 canvas element defines its height and width as something other
   than what you drew the original anchor points on, it’ll scale to that
   appropriately. To explain, I originally drew this on a 102px x 102px
   canvas so all the canvas.lineTo declarations relate to that size
   canvas. Say I want to scale it up to say 300px x 300px, I can use the
   canvas.scale method to achieve that so this bit of code calculates the
   scaling factor and applies that to the canvas which helps to retain
   quality when it’s scaled unlike bitmaps which, as we know, don’t scale
   well.
/*
Originally drawn on 102px x 102px canvas (it wouldn't go smaller without distort
ing!)
Use this scale (the original canvas size)
to calculate the appropriate scaling values for
the intended target canvas.
*/

var oScaleY = 102;
var oScaleX = 102;

canvas.scale ((element.width / oScaleX), (element.height / oScaleY)); //Scale th
e canvas to fit the canvas object's width height.

   Now, as we look at the site on a desktop PC, the logo looks great and
   is razor sharp. It’ll scale up nicely in multiples of 2 by adjusting
   the canvas element’s width and height properties and retain its
   sharpness but values other than that will give you blurred edges.
   Still, SVG does the same thing as far as I can tell from my own
   eyesight.

   So what’s the problem? Well, given that the new site is supposed to be
   responsive design and degrade (I think I’ll call it re-grading since
   there’s no loss of functionality for my site) for mobile and tablet,
   when you look at that image on a mobile or tablet, it looks blurred
   because the devicePixelRatio is greater than 1 and the image is scaled
   up by the device but retains the original dimensions as defined on the
   canvas element itself.

   On a Nexus 5 with a devicePixelRatio of 3 (at least that’s what its
   browser tells me it is) this blurriness is quite profound and looks
   something like this which, for a sharp site, looks shocking compared to
   the HTML5 SVG above.

   nexus5_screenshot

   nexus7_screenshot

   So, the fix to me seems logical: you should scale the canvas element up
   by the declared devicePixelRatio amount, let the scaling calculation in
   the drawing function handle the actual size that comes out and scale
   back using CSS.

   So, here’s the extra code before we call our drawLogo function:
// Upscale the canvas element for mobile HiDPI screens.
// It gets scaled down again to the original size by CSS.
// Keeps the HTML5 canvas sharp on all screen types.

var canvas = document.getElementById("logo");
canvas.width = canvas.width * window.devicePixelRatio;
canvas.height = canvas.height * window.devicePixelRatio;

   To retain the 102px x 102px image size that we originally intended for
   our canvas (remember this works for other sizes too!) and for it to
   look good (not just a bigger image) we need to use CSS to keep the
   canvas element’s dimensions at what we originally intended for our
   canvas.
canvas {
height: 102px;
width: 102px;
}

   In essence what I’ve done is to increase the dimensions of the canvas
   element proportionally to the devicePixelRatio so, if the
   devicePixelRatio is 3, the in-flight JavaScript resizes the entire
   element to: width = (102 x 3), height = (102 x 3). The increased size
   of the canvas element is passed to the drawLogo function which creates
   an image 3 times the size. This is then drawn on to the canvas which is
   then styled using CSS back down to 102px. The best way to think of this
   is like using an oversized PNG scaled down within the img dimensions so
   it looks OK on mobile devices.
   The end result is images that are sharp and consistent across desktop,
   tablet and mobile screens:

   nexus7_improved

   nexus5_improved

   desktop_original

   NB: Please remember that I’ve only been able to test this with the
   limited hardware available to me, all of which are Android devices.
   Nexus 5, Nexus 7 (2012 and 2013), Samsung Galaxy Nexus and of course my
   Windows 8.1 desktop. If you get different or inconsistent results with
   your devices, please let me know!

[23]Managed Service Accounts in Windows 2012

   [24]Wed 8th May, 2013 [25]Lewis [26]Leave a comment

   One for the notebook if you tend to use Managed Service Accounts
   extensively and eventually end up implementing them in a Windows Server
   2012 environment.

     For Windows Server 2012, the Windows PowerShell cmdlets default to
     managing the group Managed Service Accounts instead of the original
     standalone Managed Service Accounts.

   A useful alteration but surely retaining the default use and extending
   the cmdlet would make it less prone to us admins using MSAs regularly
   to smashing up keyboards.

[28]Active Directory Recycle Bin

   [29]Thu 18th April, 2013 [30]Lewis [31]Leave a comment

   Windows Server 2008 R2 delivered a new feature called the Active
   Directory Recycle Bin which offers the ability to restore items deleted
   from the Active Directory database by restoring them from the Recycle
   Bin with the simplicity of….well, it’s not really that simple.

   The premise is simple enough. You’ve deleted an item that you want to
   restore so instead of breaking out the backups, taking down a Domain
   Controller, booting in to DSRM and re-acquanting yourself with
   NTDSUTIL, you enable the Recycle Bin to save you all that hassle.

   But wait a minute! Before enabling the Active Directory Recycle Bin
   (ADRB) there are a couple of caveats which you should be aware of. Now,
   Microsoft will tell you what you need to enable your use of ADRB such
   as:
     * Forest Functional Level: Windows Server 2008 R2.
     * All Domain Controllers running Windows Server 2008R2

   …but the limits that enabling Active Directory Recycle Bin can have on
   restore operations is significant enough to ensure that your Backup
   Operators and Data Security personnel need to be consulted before you
   make a unilateral decision to enable it.
    1. Enabling ADRB transitions all currently Tombstoned (deleted)
       objects to the new Recycled object state. This effectively means
       that current Tombstoned objects (objects deleted in the last 180
       days) should never be restored, either through object reanimation
       or via an authoritative restore.
    2. Similar to the above, once an object reaches the Recycled object
       state (after 180 days of being a Logically Deleted object) it
       cannot be restored or recovered from backup. Microsoft recommends
       that you do not use authoritative restores at all after enabling
       ADRB and that you only use ADRB to restore objects during their
       deleted object lifetime (DOL). This article:
       http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd379542(WS.10).aspx
       details the recommendation which effectively means that restores
       must be done within the deleted object lifetime or you should
       consider the object completely unrecoverable. The deleted object
       lifetime can be adjusted at the expense of an increased AD database
       size and replication traffic but the default is 180 days.
    3. ADRB cannot restore changed objects – this must be done using an
       authoritative restore while the object is still live. Hopefully the
       proper use of change processes in your organisation should
       minimise the eventuality of this occurring and permit the ability
       to simply undo a change but we all know what happens in the real
       world.
    4. Enabling ADRB results in the size of your Active Directory
       database increasing (and consequently the replication bandwidth
       requirements) to accommodate the new object states before objects
       deleted are completely removed from the database. The increase is
       dependent on the amount and type of objects created and deleted but
       since there is a new object state, the time the objects remain in
       the database is effectively doubled.

   Once each of these discussion points has been thoroughly considered
   should you look at enabling the Active Directory Recycle Bin.

   I know this subject is fairly old hat given that Windows Server 2012 is
   now available but I’m still astonished by the numbers of Active
   Directories that I come across that aren’t making use of the Active
   Directory Recycle Bin. Reading the pro-tip (can I call myself a pro?)
   enabling it in Windows Server 2012 is pretty much a no-brainer with the
   easy-peasy GUI on offer, just be mindful of the implications.

   Pro tip: Although the procedure for using the Recycle Bin is currently
   based on PowerShell, Windows Server 2012 provides a Graphical User
   Interface to permit much simpler use of the Recycle Bin feature.

   Admission: I actually wrote this article nearly 12 months ago but never
   finished it or published it – since then Windows Server 2012 has been
   released so I’ve made mention of that in the article.

   I’m no longer looking for new challenges in 2013! I have one ready to
   go and it sounds fantastic. I’m looking forward to helping my next
   employer bring their network infrastructure and supporting services
   bang up to date so they can provide a cutting edge service to wow their
   existing customers, expand their client base in to new markets and grow
   their business the way they want it to grow.

   If I don’t say so beforehand, I hope you all have a Happy Christmas

[43]Orange infuriate my soul

   [44]Wed 3rd October, 2012 [45]Lewis [46]Leave a comment

   I recently applied to join Orange as I was spending more than I needed
   to on my monthly bills with T-Mobile. I gave T-Mobile a chance to match
   the deal I could get with Orange but they could only give me it on a 12
   month contract. I don’t do twelve month contracts any more, one month
   rolling is all I’m willing to sign up to since I buy my own mobiles
   unlocked and outright.

   Since I’ve only lived at my new address for 18 months, Orange wanted
   proof of my address using some kind of utility bill so, being the
   environmentally friendly person I am using paperless billing and online
   accounts as much as possible, I downloaded my latest bill from my
   energy provider and emailed it to Orange’s referral team as
   requested…this is what I got back.

   So the referrals department received my proof but weren’t able to
   accept it….

   No explanation as to why or what the cause of their non-acceptance was
   they just didn’t accept something they asked for and were sent. So am I
   to guess what they want?!

   Last chance Orange or I take my business to O2, again.

[48]Fedora 16 to 17 upgrade shenanigans

   [49]Fri 21st September, 2012 [50]Lewis [51]1 Comment

   Fedora 16 to 17 Upgrade…nightmare.

   I’m convinced that persons developing and using Linux on a daily basis
   insist that upgrading your Linux distro to the latest and greatest is
   supposed to be the easiest thing since wiping your own arse. In all
   frank and honesty, upgrading to Fedora 17 from 16 has been a royal pain
   in said arse.

   I first attempted to perform the upgrade shortly after Fedora 17 went
   live. I received some random error message about gtk_init moaning about
   displays or some such bollocks and didn’t bother trying any further
   thinking they’d sort something out with F16 to help you through the
   upgrade. Well, they didn’t.

   Running preupgrade on a runlevel 3 (non-GUI, you know, a server) will
   give you said error. What you’re supposed to do is execute
   preupgrade-cli. Why of course! I should have known! Did the dev forget
   to check the runlevel and offer a bit of advice instead of puking all
   over the screen? Guess not.

   Then when you run preupgrade-cli, you do so by specifying the distro to
   upgrade to:
preupgrade-cli "Fedora 17 (Beefy Miracle)"

   Then you’re moaned at for not having a large enough partition for some
   random file but told it will be all OK if you’re on a wired connection.
   Full speed ahead your system downloads all the packages and then, after
   saying its made a change to your grub config, you are safe to reboot.
   Now the system reboots…and promptly goes straight back in to F16. If
   your computer could look back at you in a nonplussed fashion, it would
   be doing.

   So you have another go and spot the error that says sh grub file or
   folder not found. Eh? How is my PC even booting if grub isn’t there? It
   turns out that F16 apparently forced an upgrade to GRUB2 and it’s your
   GRUB2 config file that receives the updated “Upgrade to Beefy Miracle”
   boot entry. Useful! Except my computer was booting from GRUB. Don’t ask
   me why, I have no idea.

   So I ensure GRUB2 is installed and on my boot partition:
grub2-install /dev/sda

   I then decide it’s wise to ensure that my GRUB2 install has the latest
   info about my system (all the kernels I had in GRUB):
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

   A reboot yields an actual option to perform the upgrade to Beefy
   Miracle so I select it and again my computer screen is puked on with
   various 404 errors. Yes, that’s right, the “second stage” URL that
   grubby spewed in to my grub.cfg at the end of preupgrade-cli was WRONG
   so I had to edit it and remove the /LiveOS\squashfs.img location
   MANUALLY by pressing “e” on the highlighted boot table entry when GRUB2
   loaded.

   Only after all this (which I admit involved a lot of reading/learning)
   did I manage to get to a point where it looked like Fedora 17 would
   install the packages it had spent an hour downloading. As I type this
   it’s still installing the F17 packages but I have no idea if it will
   actually work given how many upgrade cock-ups I’ve had to battle my way
   through so far. Someone at Fedora needs shooting.
