[4]Thursday Tasters - Future Jared (1)

   [5][Thursday%2BTaster%2Bimage.jpg]
   Welcome everyone to Thursday Tasters, new writing from a disparate and
   entertaining group of writers (I dare to say including myself). You can
   access all this week's tasters by clicking here:[6]http://
   [7]bit.ly/1nd4hJC
   Okay - Jared is back. He's rough, raw and in need of a redraft, to say
   nothing of the new story in which he features. However TTs are all
   about rough and raw, so here's an unapologetic blast from draft number
   one.
   From Jared and the Reluctant Groupie
   Everyone cheered again, however well or otherwise they knew the song,
   and they both dived into a jagged rhythmic intro on their guitars
   before the lead guy cut loose with a series of high-pitched electronic
   screams from his frets. The music was immediate and captivating, more
   so Kareena knew because her parents would hate it, along with her
   presence at in such a dive of a bar. It was guilty and reckless, but
   fun too. She wasn’t quite sure what they were singing—something about
   kicking up back-streets looking for action—but they sang it with such
   passion that she loved it. Passion appealed, more so when projected by
   such attractive exponents of the sentiments.
   The singer was lean and would have been clean-cut in his good looks had
   it not been for the great wavy main of black hair and his raggedy black
   t-shirt. Kareena liked him instantly, but was drawn too by the lead
   guitarist. Maybe it was his virtuosity on the instrument, maybe the
   unshowy way he went about playing. Or maybe it was that rock-hewn
   sweaty torso so much of which was on display under his scant leather
   waistcoat. God, look at those tattoos. How much must it have hurt
   getting that? His long hair was tied back to show off that sweating
   angular face—not as straightforward-handsome as the singer’s, but
   appealing in a harder manly kind of way.
   The other band members were good too. Kareena’s understanding of rock
   was limited, but she knew this group of guys worked well together. The
   shaven-headed bassist had his head down, exhibiting an almost grim
   focus and the drummer was having a ball. The latter was the youngest of
   the group, a fresh-faced guy of around Kareena’s age with blond hair
   and an attitude that he was simply glad to be there with these other
   talented guys. His joy was apparent in every blow he hammered down with
   his sticks.
   The hard sexiness of the music was infectious. Lacey was dancing
   already, writhing her booty shamelessly right in front of the band
   members. Her vest she’d knotted around her stomach to show off the
   prospect of her slim-fits to best effect, one which was not lost on the
   musicians. Kareena had been persuaded to opt for a similar look and it
   daunted her at first. Her plaid shirt was knotted in similar fashion to
   Lacey’s at her tummy, the absence of a belly-button piercing her main
   point of contrast. The denim skirt, her cousin’s present to her for her
   nineteenth birthday, was skirting her thighs and clinging to her ass
   like a second skin. Hardly a surprise then that her hard-wired reserve
   plagued her at first as she danced.
   “Unbutton some more,” Lacey had urged when the taxi dropped them off,
   and Kareena was thankful that she’d resisted all prompting to show off
   more cleavage. With two of the band members feet away and looking down
   from a raised platform as they played, it was good to know they
   couldn’t see right down between her breasts. She was sure she caught
   the lead guitar guy trying on a couple of occasions and it distracted
   her from her more sedate version of Lacey’s moves.
   “So, which one do you want?” her dark-haired cousin inquired in her
   ear.
   “What?”
   “Between these two.” Lacey gazed up with no hint of discretion at lead
   singer and guitarist as they harmonized on a refrain. “I talked you
   into coming here, so it’s only fair you get to choose.” The girl was
   kidding, right? Adding a little more provocation to the evening. “I
   can’t have both,” Lacey said with a follow-up smirk. “Well I could, but
   I’m not gonna be greedy? So tell me, which?”

[16]Thursday Tasters - Twenty-One (3)

   [17][Thursday%2BTaster%2Bimage.jpg]
   Thursday Tasters - where writers provide a sample of their newest work
   or even work in progress. To sample ALL of this week's tasters, follow
   this link: [18]http://
   [19]bit.ly/1kCrE3m
   Here's a final excerpt from my new story Twenty-One, featuring suave
   bastard Gavin McClain. Birthday girl Brooke has accepted a dare to hit
   in the dark handsome stranger at the bar of the night-club where she
   has been celebrating with friends. But now, back at his hotel room,
   she's realising the kind of man with whom she's dealing...
   “Strip,” he told her, “to your birthday suit. Heels on. Do it.”
   She fumbled her way back into her shoes, clutching his torso to sustain
   her balance. Even then she didn’t quite know how to go about the next
   bit. “How would you like me to …”
   “Slowly. Would some music help?”
   She looked into his eyes and grasped for any concession he had on
   offer. “Yes. Yes, I’d like that.”
   “Come with me.” He led her from the sitting area where he’d enjoyed the
   tight-ripping interlude, through a moulded archway to the bedroom.
   Clicking on the lamps either side of the regally carved bedhead, he
   found the control for the suite’s entertainment system and spent a few
   moments flicking through the digital read-out on the wall-mounted
   television screen. She looked on, timid and helpless. “Got it,” he said
   with a degree of satisfaction. “You know this one?”
   Feist’s Inside and Out. “Yeah, I like it.” Though somehow she felt the
   slinky tune would never sound the same to her again. It was something
   to sway to, something on which to focus as she took off all her clothes
   for this man. He sat down on the edge of the bed, relaxed and
   expectant, the dark bulged cotton of his shorts showing through
   partially unbuttoned flies.
   She moved to the music in front of him, her body striving to remember
   what it had done so easily on countless dance floors. He propped
   himself on the covers and considered her. Cool jazz helped relieve her
   of her stumbling, that and the task of unfastening her dress at the
   back. No dice—her fingers felt way too clumsy. Hesitantly, with some
   unaccountable need to please, she brought herself to the V of his
   parted legs and turned about. “Would you …?”
   “My pleasure.”
   He unclasped her deftly and drew the zipper downwards, a long, slow
   movement. She imagined his eyes following the smooth valley of her
   spine as he unzipped her, all the way down to the curve of her butt,
   where her thong began its plunge. When she made to move away and
   continue her dance, he stopped her. “Turn around. Take the dress off
   here.” She shifted to face him, heart fluttering at his casual upward
   gaze, those eyes calmly awaiting her exposure.
   She eased the single strap from her untattooed right shoulder and was
   amazed at how much, despite all her anxiety, she wanted to strip for
   this man. It didn’t matter to her whether or not he deserved it—she
   simply hoped his cock would swell harder at the sight of her. The
   thought stayed as she let the bodice’s padding part from her breasts.
   James McFerrin had gazed in awe and gratitude anytime she let him see
   her firm, ample C-cups; it was enough that Gavin’s stare softened a
   little in appreciation. Her nipples, she knew, were rosy in the light
   and hard for him. She found the courage to peel off the dress
   completely and step out of it, displaying herself for him in thong and
   heels.

[31]Tantalizing Tuesday - Brooke's Birthday Punishment (Revisited)

   [32][Tantalizing+Tuesdays+banner.jpg]
   Tantalizing Tuesdays are all about tease - and I'm going to play that
   game to the max this week. You can access all this week's teasers by
   following this link: [33]http://
   [34]bit.ly/1s8RxH9
   I'm recycling a teaser this week, as it's based on my new Gavin McClain
   story released today on Amazon. I hope you'll feel motivated to check
   out the whole tale. Here's a scene from Twenty-One, in which
   birthday-girl Brooke discovers how things turn out when you get bold
   with a man like Gavin...
   [35][hot+naked+ass+2.jpg]
   Brooke’s Birthday Punishment
   Brooke found herself nose-to-nose with her reflection in a large
   gilt-framed mirror. “Stretch those arms. Grip the mantle.” Gavin was
   deftly manhandling her into position. “Now stick out that ass.” She
   obeyed, heart accelerating wildly. Then Gavin’s hand was on her
   out-thrust derriere, moving in smooth circles about her cheeks. “This
   is one well-toned bum. Taut and athletic. How do you keep it so trim?”
   “Circuits.” Her voice quaked at his exploration of her naked ass. “And…
   weekly butt and thighs class.”
   “It pays dividends. This is one well-sculpted bottom.” He continued to
   grope the area under discussion. “Remind me how old you are today?”
   “Twenty-one.”
   “Good. Start counting.”
   “Sorry?” Gavin’s hand withdrew and whipped back, smacking soundly. The
   initial shock of impact gave way rapidly to stinging pain. “Owww!”
   “Count.”
   Understanding dawned along with dread and excitement. “One.” Oh god, my
   poor ass.
   Whack. A spank to her other buttock resulted in equivalent sting.
   “Shit! Two!”
   “That’s the game.” There was calm enjoyment in Gavin’s voice. “We’re
   going all the way to twenty-one. And then…” He gripped her shoulder to
   brace for the next application of his palm. “…I’m going to ram my cock
   inside you to the balls.”
   Go on, you know you want to read the whole thing... : [36]http://

[47]Thursday Tasters - Twenty-One (2)

   [48][Thursday+Taster+image.jpg]
   Happy Thursday, everyone. My taster is only one among many examples of
   new writing. To access all this week's tasters follow this
   link: [49]http://
   [50]bit.ly/1m0q2M5
   My story Twenty-One will be published in five days' time on Tuesday
   August 5th. Birthday-girl Brooke has been cajoled into making a move on
   the suave older guy at the bar of the Manhattan night-spot visited by
   her and her friends, unaware that he's the dominant and sexually
   voracious force of nature called Gavin McClain. Here as she travels
   with him in a cab back to his hotel, she's beginning to understand the
   type of man with whom she's dealing...
   “Plaza Hotel,” he instructed the driver and Brooke’s eyes widened at
   mention of the five-star location. The New York Plaza, I don’t believe
   it! Kimber would seethe to think she had missed out on a romantic
   liaison at such an exclusive place. Gavin smiled to see her excitement.
   “A business trip should be no more arduous than it has to be, don’t you
   think, Brooke?”
   “I’m sure you owe yourself some luxury with a busy day ahead.”
   “Exactly what I was thinking.” He ran a finger lightly over her
   cheekbone and she clutched her purse to disguise the extent to which
   her body was trembling. Already the cab had slipped out from the
   kerbside into the stream of car lights. “Whereas you’re thinking ‘How
   the hell did I end up in a cab with a man twice my age who I don’t even
   know?’ Am I right?”
   “Maybe,” she said. Her eyes did not shift from his, however thunderous
   her heartbeat. “A little.”
   “Are you a good girl, Brooke?”
   Oh god. No doubt then as to where the evening was headed. She
   endeavoured to retain her cool. That was if she’d displayed any to
   begin with. “What do you think?”
   His palm flexed to cup the side of her face and he’d put his lips on
   hers before she had time to react. The taste of Scotch was fresh and
   sour on his tongue, and his aftershave was sharp in her nostrils. His
   kiss was firm, slow and rhythmic, drawing from her a full-mouthed
   response as her body melted into his Armani-wrapped frame. His
   restrained hunger absorbed her senses and blotted out all sensible
   thought till his mouth broke from hers.
   “I think,” he told her, fingers still caressing her face, “that that
   was a good-girl kiss. Very pleasant, but good-girl nonetheless.”
   Her response was instinctive. She hadn’t set out on her birthday
   evening to be labelled a ‘good-girl’. Gripping his face with both hands
   she kissed his hard mouth, plunging her tongue and lapping at his, her
   body pressing close and the taxi guy could look all he damn well liked.
   Her heart-rate surged from her boldness with this great strong man.
   When she let him go she was panting with the rush, but bit her bottom
   lip to disguise it. “What about that one?”
   “Definite bad-girl potential,” he said voice heavy with approval. “Tell
   me, Brooke, what’s the baddest thing you’ve ever done?”
   The question stalled her show of courage. “That’s a presumptuous
   question to ask a girl you’ve only met.”
   “This from the girl who hit on me while I was standing minding my own
   business. Presumption’s fun, Brooke, and you know it.”
   Neon and sodium lights were flashing all around them as the taxi
   slalomed through the traffic flow. Brooke was playing some scary game
   with the guy who’d invented its rules and nothing in her life to date
   had felt so exciting. “I suppose that’s a good point.”
   “You damn well know it is. Now tell me a wicked secret.”
   Brooke shares her secret and much more in Twenty-One. Available from
   Amazon and Smashwords on August 5th.

[60]Mid-Summer Update: Extra-Curricular is Finished (Kind of)

   Okay, this type of blog isn't the most creative, but it's useful for me
   even if it's a massive snooze for everyone else. Kind of consolidates
   things. Plus I'll liven it up with some random sexy pics. Can't say
   fairer than that, right?
   [61][Compromised+Cop.jpg]
   The Malden publicity machine has developed a few more cogs and is
   running more smoothly than I'd ever dared expect. This is entirely due
   to other people - so thank you other people. I'm therefore going to
   stick to the part over which I have most control, the actual writing.
   Extra-Curricular is finished! If you don't know (and there aren't any
   overwhelming reasons why you should), it's the fifth in my Gavin
   McClain series and, as it turns out, the longest by a country mile -
   the initial draft stands at somewhere over 58k. I'm planning on a
   November publication date, which will give me vast tracts of time to
   make sure that it's as good as it can be. It took longer to write than
   I'd ever intended, but amazingly the completed draft is pretty
   coherent. The good news, for those who keep coming back to my work, is
   that as well as being a genuine STORY, it's also a MASSIVE SEX-FEST. I
   mean there's a truckload of dirty sex action in this tale and it's all
   kinds of taboo-bustingly wrong. (Not icky taboos either - fun ones.
   Malden kind of wrong, I promise you, and in spades.)
   My worry, having written it in several concerted bursts over a ten
   month period, was that it wouldn't hold together as a single read. Well
   I ran it past my long-time erotic co-conspirator, good friend and most
   honest critic Mia Natasha this week and her verdict was that it works.
   She read it in one four and a half-hour sitting, so she tells me, and
   was positive enough to put a big fat smile on my face. Her thumbs-up
   review is a serious relief. It's particularly good to know that my
   characterising of Gavin is on track and I should keep taking him where
   I'm taking him, i.e. to all kinds of naughty places.
   [62][Girls+Get+it+On.jpg]
   For anyone who's wondering following by blog entry of 14/09/13, yes I
   DID include the cucumber and the nasty factor got cranked up to
   somewhere around 13.
   [63]http://
   [64]bit.ly/167gtD9
   [65][Cumber+Girl.jpg]
   As for redrafting, that'll happen another time - I'm just glad to have
   this beast at bay. Now I can make final tweaks to the fourth Gavin
   story (Twenty-One, due out next Tuesday, August 5th) and set about my
   mammoth summertime project. Hopefully there'll be more about that at
   the weekend.
   Ah the joy of nailing a first draft. It means one less story competing
   for space in my head. Problem is all the others will just shout all the
   louder...

[74]Tantalizing Tuesdays - Twenty-One (Revisited)

   [75][Tantalizing+Tuesdays+banner.jpg]
   I haven't done this in a while and, truth be told, I'm cheating this
   week by providing a 'classic' (you decide on whether or not that word
   is warranted) Tuesday teaser from some time ago. If you'd like to check
   out all the teasers (including other writers' NEW stuff), follow this
   link: [76]http://
   [77]bit.ly/1pybxA8
   Now to explain... My new Gavin McClain story Twenty-One will be
   available on August 5th (7 days' time). The story evolved from the
   first Tantalizing Tuesday 200-word teaser I ever wrote, so it seems an
   appropriate time to post it again. I hope you'll read it - and if you
   like it, know that the full story will be available VERY soon. Enjoy.
   (It was the accompanying photo that gave me the idea in an instant.)
   [78][lil+slut+(1).JPG]
   Twenty-One
   “Suck.”
   Brooke’s eyes stretched wide to match her mouth. She stared upwards
   over granite pectoral contours to that stony face. Her fingers
   fluttered involuntarily at her bare thighs.
   “No hands.”
   Holy hell, how had she got herself into this?
   But she knew the answer. “It’s your coming-of-age,” Kimber had said,
   face prim and taunting. “No more college boys. Tonight you take a shot
   at the hottest older guy in the club.”
   “You mean…”
   “The James Bond-type sitting near the bar. You’ve been checking him out
   long enough. Now go do something about it. I’m daring you.”
   The other girls grinned in expectation. Heart thumping she left her
   seat and approached. He looked a gentleman, however dark and austere.
   Maybe beneath that stern exterior beat a tender heart.
   “Hi there.”
   He cradled his scotch and returned her smile…
   Now naked in his hotel room, she knelt with lips stretched oval about
   his great cock. He throbbed hot on her tongue. The muscles in his
   forearm flexed as his hand closed to grip her chin.
   “Get to work, birthday-girl,” he said. “Show me what that mouth is
   for.”
   Oh well, a young woman had to adapt to circumstance.
   She started to suck.

[88]Thursday Tasters - Twenty-One (1)

   [89][Thursday+Taster+image.jpg]
   I'm a day late and for that I apologise, but I'm clawing my way back
   from the mid-summer work malaise and taking that into account I hope
   you'll forgive me. You can access all this week's 'tasters', from a
   range of talented writers, by following this link:
   [90]http://
   [91]bit.ly/1nFXbSL
   My Gavin McClain story Twenty-One, the fourth in the series, will be
   published on Tuesday 5th August. It tells the story of Brooke, a girl
   who takes on more than she can handle on the twenty-first birthday when
   dared to hit on a dark and debonair Englishman at a New York night
   spot. You already know his name...
   [92][Twenty-One+Book+Cover.JPG]
   She’d given him her animated, smiling, blue-eyed best, but eventually
   her words tailed away sadly. Perhaps such tactics only worked with
   naïve college types. She released his wrist abashed at her own
   recklessness.
   But there was a certain thawing of his flinty visage. His eyes took her
   in properly for the first time. In fact they went on a brief tour and
   took her all in before settling on her face. “Twenty-first, eh? So this
   is a rite of passage.”
   “A…”
   “A coming of age.”
   “Yeah, I know. I know what a rite of passage is.” Her eyes dropped with
   a shyness she hadn’t felt in years. “I guess that’s what my friend had
   in mind.” God, they’d been Kimber’s exact words.
   “So you’re swallowing all your trepidation and approaching what your
   friend no doubt described as ‘a real man’, or something similar.” His
   voice has softened and she raised her eyes to his, trying to transcend
   her girlishness. His features had fully relaxed as well, to something
   amiable. Playful. “Yet there I was,” he said, “treating you like a
   schoolgirl. ,Very lacking in chivalry. What can I get you to drink?”
   Brooke’s relief was like a rush of cooling water. “I’ll have a mint
   julep. Thank you.”
   He raised a hand and drew immediate attention from the girl serving
   closest. “Mint julep for the young lady.” He smiled at Brooke and she
   tried, quite heroically she thought, not to simper. “A twenty-first
   birthday should be celebrated in style. My nephew turned twenty-one a
   couple of months back. I took quite a deal of trouble to make it
   memorable.”
   “That’s very family-spirited of you.” God, he had a grown nephew, this
   man. It served to emphasize the age-gap. This was a man of maturity, of
   responsibility. “Still,” she said, “I don’t mean to take up your time.
   You looked kind of preoccupied sitting there.”
   “Last-minute prep for a business meeting tomorrow morning. It’s the
   reason I’m in the States.”
   “Oh wow, I’m sorry. If I’d known …”
   “You’d have done exactly what you did,” he said, and she blushed to be
   called on her disingenuous comment. “And you’d have been right to. If I
   wasn’t open to distraction I’d have stayed in my hotel room to work.”
   “So I’m a distraction?” she asked, brushing a loose strand of hair
   behind her ear and daring to look straight into his dark eyes.
   “A pleasant distraction,” he told her, intensifying her blush. “Going
   by the name of …”
   “Brooke. I’m Brooke.”
   “I tell you what, Brooke−you help me clear my head of everything
   business-related and I’ll help you celebrate your birthday. How does
   that sound?”
   She almost let the mint julep spill as he handed it to her. “It’s a
   deal …”
   “Gavin,” he said, taking her slim hand gently in his massive grip.
   “I love that name., Pleased to meet you, Gavin.”

About Me

   [191]My Photo

   [192]Jake Malden
          I'm a free-lance journalist and recently published erotic
          writer. My titles 'The Jared Effect', 'Gabrielle and the Devil'
          and 'No Mercy' are now available on Smashwords and Amazon. When
          not meeting deadlines I enjoy fitness training, reading, cinema
          and sex. The last of these has caused a few close-shaves with
          deadlines.
