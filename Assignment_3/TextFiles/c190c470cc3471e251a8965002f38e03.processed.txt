   info:
   was born on November 8, 1987 and raised in Bronx, NY. Being both Puerto
   Rican and Dominican decent Erica Mena has a feisty personality and
   enough talent to take over the industry. Growing up Erica was always in
   a performing arts class or activities. Erica’s ambition and drive at a
   young age didn’t go unseen. It wasn’t long before a NY agent published
   her in his agency’s magazine and things skyrocketed from there. Erica
   started to get requested and booked for catalog and print ads at
   fourteen. Shortly after an MTV scout discovered her and she went on to
   win a huge Jennifer Lopez lookalike contest. It didn’t take her long to
   create her own name and gain some serious recognition within the
   industry.Erica also starred on the 1 rated hit show “Kourtney and Khloe
   take Miami” which premiered on E! She has landed many coveted principal
   roles in major music videos such as “I’m So Paid” with Akon featuring
   Young Jeezy and Lil Wayne and more, which officially put her on the
   radar of every household in America.Erica Mena has graced the pages of
   XXL Magazine, KING Magazine, The Source, Hype Hair and Don Diva to name
   a few. She was the inspiration for SHOW Magazine’s concept and first
   ever cover girl. That led to many more glossy photos of her popping up
   on newsstands everywhere, not to mention several print campaigns such
   as Roca Wear, Tommy Hilfiger as well as being a spokes model for
   various companies domestically and internationally.You can also see her
   star in “LOVE & HIP HOP” on VH1. Her role has grown tremendously over
   the past few seasons and Team Mena continues to skyrocket taking her
   fan base into the millions. Erica’s hard work and persistence in this
   game has opened up many different business endeavors.One thing many
   people don’t know is that Erica has always had a passion for fashion.
   She has been sketching since she was 8 years old. She teamed up with
   Randa Quraan of Socially Loud and created “Her” by Erica Mena a
   clothing line that will cater to men and women. You can find new fresh
   innovative pieces that will drop periodically on here, but catch her
   wearing her official 2015 Spring/Summer collection line on season 5 of
   Love & Hip Hop, which will consist of pencil skirts, dresses and more
