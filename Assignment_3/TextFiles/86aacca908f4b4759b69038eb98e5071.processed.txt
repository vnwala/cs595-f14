[10]Post Show News!

   Posted on [11]September 14, 2014 by [12]Lady Havah
   [13]Reply

   It is with great excitement that we announce the return of the
   undermine journal! Kero found the note below after the creation of this
   week’s show and we want to make sure that you had the news!

   Welcome back TUJ!! I missed you.

   ~~LadyHavah

   from [14]https://theunderminejournal.com/#earthen-ring/horde

   September 3, 2014

   We’ve recently had to move our operation to a new facility, and our old
   equipment and data could not come with us. So, what’s old is new again,
   and we’re back in beta testing as things get back up to speed.

   95% of the TUJ code is newly written, and the underlying system is a
   fresh install. This means that many of the features we once shared are
   no longer available, but we tried to get the most important stuff back
   up and running. Items, sellers, and battle pets pages can all be found
   behind the Search box in the top right corner.

   Our data collection is fresh as well, and we no longer have the old
   history data. This isn’t as big a problem as you’d guess, since realms
   are getting connected all the time, and the Alliance and Horde auction
   houses will be joined with WoW 6.0 later this season anyway. When that
   happens, we’ll wipe the data once again, since it’ll be a whole new
   market.

   Category pages are not yet available, but we plan on getting those back
   up and running over the next few weeks. There are no plans to rebuild
   market notifications, the market API, or the addon. EU realms are also
   unavailable, though we plan on supporting all EU realms when the
   Warlords of Draenor pre-patch is released.

   Since we are beta testing, we welcome your feedback [15]in our official
   forum. Expect things to change and grow over the coming weeks.

   Thank you for your patience and support while we were away. We hope you
   like our new look, and we’re happy to continue serving your auction
   house data needs.

   It is time to say (again) changes are coming. But only 1 change is
   announced (more to come?). In here you could find a pick for mining, 2
   new pets, and [30]Tradeskillmaster.com. Plus stress test result,
   [31]Lords of War, and the Grand Expedition Yak. Go and listen.

   Lady Havah), Garrison set up, and the Undermine Journal.

   We also talk about Hackers, 10 years of Warcraft, and the Release Date
   for WoD (among other stuff).
