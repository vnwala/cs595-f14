       Last week was a big antitrust week for the new law firm of [31]Bona
       Law PC. First, it was the [32]ABA Antitrust Spring Meeting, where
       antitrust lawyers from all over the world descend upon Washington,
       DC to obsess over antitrust and competition for several days.
       Second, I was writing an antitrust brief in a significant antitrust
       case.
       Finally, I argued at a motion-to-dismiss hearing in the case[33]Dr.
       Yvoune Kara Petrie, DC v. Virginia Board of Medicine, et al. I
       represent Yvoune Petrie, a doctor of chiropractic, in an antitrust
       lawsuit (Sherman Act, Section 1) against the Virginia Board of
       Medicine and several of its board members. Update: [34]We survived
       the motion to dismiss."
       With my clients request and permission, I thought I would tell you
       a little more about it"."
       A Growing number of leaders in healthcare are beginning to realize
       the VA Scandal is a misnomer. It is more appropriately termed
       Healthcare Scandals exposed. The V.A. Scandal probably came to
       national attention as it was exploited for partisan politics. The
       Scandal at the VA is probably not much different than the scandal
       at UMKC-Pathology, and that is not much different than other
       scandals which intermittently rock hospitals around the country.
       Another factor that may have brought the VA Scandal to national
       attention is the relatively large size of the VA system compared to
       other hospitals such as UMKC. The system that led to the
       UMKC-Pathology Scandal is no different than that of the VA. In
       addition, the Medical Board attempted to reprimand the
       whistleblower documenting months of poor cancer care for women who
       had lumpectomy specimens. They did not make preliminary
       investigations to show that the DIO was lying about the
       documentation of "Ischemic Time." Which they will not often find in
       the surgical pathology reports from Nov 2010 to June 2011 because
       as I told the ACGME, the breast specimens often sat on the counter
       for a couple to a few hours. After one hour, the receptor status
       starts to change and these women with hormone receptor positive
       breast cancer likely did not get the correct treatment. Taking a
       group of physicians to court and claiming that numerous
       highly-respected physicians are violating antitrust laws takes
       courage. Read more from this brave attorney here.

       Many physicians will claim he is unethical, or out for money.
       However, what the medical boards typically do not advertise, is
       that they commit crimes worse than those they reprimand.

       Medical Board Fraud
       Peer Review Fails Repeatedly
       1. Dr. Antoine Adem -2012 -2014+: reprimanded for providing good
       medical care by the Missouri Medical Board who committed six counts
       of fraud against him.
       2. VAScandal: Peer review also failed in the VA. This probably came
       to more attention because the GOP has used it for their political
       campaign againnst the ACA. Regardless of your political
       affiliation, you are welcome to share your comments here.
       3. UMKC Pathology Department 2010 - 2014+ - DIO lied to Amy Beane
       of the ACGME and claimed they documented the ischemic time of
       patient's tumors. No investigation was made to review the reports
       from that time period to verify this claim. Dr. Snodgrass was later
       reprimanded by the medical board for filing this claim, which they,
       without investigation, asserted to be false. If the ACGME or the
       Missouri Medical Board were to review the lumpectomy reports from
       November 2010 to June 2011, they would realize that the reports do
       not contain the claimed "ischemic time," also known as the "time to
       formalin fixation," as the DIO from UMKC in Kansas City claimed
       that they often did.
       4. Missouri Medical Board Reprimanded Doctor for Providing
       FDA-approved Excellent Medical Care - 1990's - see below for more
       details.
       5. Medical Board bullied the woman in this video:  and cost her
       many thousands of dollars, which they did not pay her. The Medical
       Boards claim patient safety, while committing fraud, repeatedly
       reprimanding good care, and want more of the States Money and
       absolutely no accountability for their decisions.
       6. Texas Medical Board: Bullied Dr. Buryzinski for performing
       medical research with the FDAs approval. They have conflated
       standard clinical practice with clinical research. Their conduct
       suggests that it may be beneficial if someone with clinical trial
       experience serves on medical boards.
       7. RoboRob a case of slander by his peers: Prominent UA doctor
       taunted as 'Robo Rob' says settlement clears
       him. http://tucson.com/news/science/health-med-fit/prominent-ua-doc

       3-57f5-acf8-cc0a1c266b2e.html
       8. Texas Medical Board: Potential conflicts of interest in filing
       reprimands, and apparently the medical board reprimanded a
       radiologist without first reviewing the x-rays to determine whether
       or not they exhibited metastatic
       cancer. http://www.houstonpress.com/2014-03-27/news/steven-hotze-te
       xas-medical-board/  in defense of the President of the Texas
       Medical Board: I would commend her on (1) making decisions outside
       her ABMS specialty, as I once taught a night float radiologist how
       to examine CT Scans of the Head for midline shift after trauma; and
       then (2) claiming that she trained at Johns Hopkins. Some people
       have maligned her stating that she trained at a clinic outside of
       Johns Hopkins and thus it doesn't count. Such statements are petty,
       and completely miss the issues of medical regulation and patient
       safety. In my humble opinion, if her hospital states that it was
       affiliated with Johns Hopkins University, as the hospital I trained
       at for a year in North Carolina, Carolinas Medical Center claimed
       it was affiliated with University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,
       then it should be reported as such.
       9. Oklahoma University Medical School, Pediatrics Department:
       Altered the score of one of the medical students that they did not
       like and dismissed him from the residency. In addition, the
       Oklahoma University Medical School had to pay him in court.
       10. Missouri Medical Board: Reprimanded a cardiothoracic surgeon
       for a terrible error that the nurse caused one week after the
       surgery. (link pending)=____
       11. Report from Maryland: Maryland stole this man's medical license
       based on
       politics. http://mdreport.blogspot.com/2012/08/stealing-medical-lic

       With the advent of the internet, patient safety advocates are
       getting a closer look into the details of medical regulation. That
       they do a great job many times. In addition, they have a side that
       harms patients. More reports are continually surfacing and being
       obtained from the archives detailing how medical boards harass
       doctors for "by the books," "excellent," "FDA-approved medical
       care," and don't follow the American Medical Association Code of
       Medical Ethics. With an upcoming supreme court decision, it is
       important that we are ***Transparent*** for appropriate decision
       making.
       Medical Boards committing Fraud & Harassing Doctors for Good Care
       reported in #TX #SD #VA #MO. #VAScandal #SCOTUS
       Reading the Medical Board Court Cases is more action packed than
       most reality TV Shows. So pull up a chair, and get cozy.
       Bringing you the real world of medical regulation,
       from (1) fraud to (2) inappropriate sexual conduct, to (3) patient
       harm, to (4) reprimanding excellent patient care.
       Drama fans, medical educators, and policy regulators will likely
       find this a useful resource. Furthermore, with the current
       physician shortage, it will be upon patients to advocate for reform
       in medical regulation. If they cannot afford to see a doctor, it
       isn't necessarily because of Obama Care. It may be secondary to a
       medical board reprimanding a doctor for providing good medical
       care, or for them determining that a doctor does not have good
       moral character.
       Surely there is no one perfect, but if that is the standard which
       physicians must be at for their entire life (past and future), then
       we will likely see patients die without care. Personally, I find
       saving lives through appropriate medical care to be incredibly
       rewarding, but there are a number of factors that determine medical
       regulation. Furthermore, these factors are continually in flux, and
       it is up to patients and patient-advocates to ensure that the
       policies favor patient safety and not merely provide absolute
       immunity to physicians.
       An excellent reference with many medical ethics cases is the
       American Medical Association's Virtual Mentor. However, the ethics
       cases do not cover how the system can redress and stop fraud by
       medical boards. The aim would not be to punish people for serving
       on medical boards, except in cases where they commit fraud and
       reprimand good medical care. Patients who are harmed want justice,
       and society needs to discuss if malpractice is the means to that,
       or whether actions by medical boards is the means. Many times poor
       outcome is not related to the quality of the provided patient care
       and society needs to be made aware of this. Medical Boards, patient
       advocate societies, and lawyers probably should work
       collaboratively to establish and equitable and fair system.
       An article that I enjoyed reading is found here. It asks numerous
       prudent questions, questions that may never be answered.

       Attached are my comments from the case of "RoboRob," a derogatory
       term, not uncommonly used by those on peer review bodies to insult
       someone they do not like.
       Thank you for sharing. I am collecting cases of failed peer-review
       from around the country. Topics include blatant fraud committed by
       medical boards, reprimanding physicians for FDA-approved, "by the
       books," "excellent medical care." There was a case in Missouri
       where Dr. Antoine Adem was brought to court for providing
       appropriate patient care. The Medical Board could have spent one
       hour reviewing the cardiac stent guidelines to realize he had been
       providing good medical care. Instead of doing that the Medical
       Board committed six counts of fraud v. him. I will be adding a link
       to this story to the collection.
       http://drsocial.org/forums/topic/276/-/view/post_id/430
       Your report from Arizona, the Missouri Medical board Fraud, and
       several other cases provide detail into an organization that has
       not had, and does not want accountability. Scandal rocks the V.A.
       and peer review repeatedly failed . There have been over 100,000
       view of the article written by Yinka Vidal on the lack of
       accountability of peer-review groups and administrative bodies
       within healthcare.
       Vidal's work predated the Institute of Medicine's report on medical
       error by several years, and he was initially ridiculed for his
       observations of systematic patient harm in healthcare. The lack of
       accountability of medical boards and hospital administration have
       silence front-line workers, permitted pockets of corruption. After
       the Medical Board committed six counts of fraud v. the cardiologist
       Dr. Antoine Adem for good medical care. They went home without
       reprimand and received payment for their unprofessional, unethical,
       and unfathomable conduct. Do not take my word for it, read what the
       Judge wrote. Court excerpts and links to court cases along with
       commentary demonstrating a shocking lack of medical knowledge, in
       addition to fraud, by those on peer-review committees might be a
       concern to many.
       If you or someone you know has witnessed sham peer review, patient
       harm accepted by the medical board based on academic title, or the
       reprimanding of whistleblowing without investigating, then please
       share your comments.

       Arnold S Relman from NEJM
       [EMBED]
       From the New England Journal of Medicine,
       Dr. Arnold S. Relman comments on professional regulation.

       -----------------------------------------------------------
       Here is a case, where the attending was out of the country for
       several months, and a graduate from a medical school, who had not
       trained in residency, started seeing patients without supervision,
       and then Ran up a Medicare bill of $200,000!

       started seeing patients, and billed Medicare
         1.
         2. From August 28, 1994 through January 30, 1998, 1,873 Medicaid
            claims for 502 individual patients were filed under Abanishe’s
            provider number.[42][1]  The total billed was $201,046.76; the
            total paid by Medicaid was $51,040.45.[43][2]
       http://ahc.mo.gov/ahc/case/hura.13-1301HA.AMB.pdf/
       ______________________

       [45][2]Id.

       Something that many physicians are not trained in during medical
       school are the ethics of professional regulation. They are naively
       led along that if they do the right thing, they will remain out of
       trouble with regulatory agencies. No one is perfect and always does
       the right thing. For example,a  speeding ticket is breaking the
       law, is unethical for a physician, and unprofessional, but doing it
       once is probably not related to patient care.

        More importantly doctors in-training are taught that if they
       provide good care of patients, and follow ethical and regulatory
       guidelines they will not encounter troubles with the medical
       boards.

       This is not necessarily due, and in my review of medical board
       cases I wanted to share the good and the bad so that people will
       have a better idea, and a medical analysis regarding the ethics of
       professional regulation. I state a medical analysis, because not
       many physiciains read medical board actions and discussions for
       years. Most physicians are afraid of the medical board, possibly
       because they have absolute immunity. Some lawyers are defending
       physicians against the medical boards and suing them for
       anti-trust. Well, I will add more commentary with potential policy
       implications  related to medical boards. Through the internet,
       physicians and patients now have the opportunity to be heard. This
       is something that medical boards were not traditionally familiar
       with. However, we must remember to put patient care first, and when
       medical boards reprimand good care, and prevent patient care
       through their regulation, patient advocates need to investigate and
       work with state representatives and senators.

       Most people have some form of accountability for their decisions.
       An exception is those persons who "serve," on medical boards. As
       several case examples will show, medical boards reprimand good care
       in addition to bad care. Furthermore, the care that they have
       occasionally reprimanded as "bad," is not abstruse and any
       physician should be able to determine whether it is appropriate.

       This doctor may have lost their medical license, but, in my
       opinion,  their odious behavior warrants criminal prosecution,

       However, due to the odious nature of this offense, it doesn't
       require a medical degree to reprimand this person. The MD or DO on
       a medical board would presumably be used to give insight into cases
       of whether the doctor was following current guidelines, excetra.

       Here is a case where the Medical Board ruled in favor of patient
       safety. One need not have a doctorate degree to reprimand this
       physician. Having physicians on a licensing board should be used in
       cases where "common sense," may not be enough.

       Here is a case where the medical board attempted to reprimand this
       physician for excellent medical care.
       If medical boards are reprimanding, or trying to reprimand "by the
       books," "simple," "non-abstruse," "FDA-approved," medical care,
       then one might ask the following questions

       1. Do we need doctors to serve on the medical board
       2. Why don't the doctors on the medical board perform their due
       diligence
       3. Is absolute immunity of medical board members helping board
       members, or patients?

          + We also rank very high in rates of fraud and misconduct
            committed by medical boards. We need legislative advocacy.
            According to the medical board, every medical student in the
            state is practicing medicine without a license when they form
            a "diagnosis," after seeing the patient.
            Laws need to state that clinical diagnosis of practicing
            without a license is when the diagnosis of another physician
            is rendered not as an opinion, but as a the diagnosis that is
            informed to the patient and presented as such, and without
            commentary by the physician who is the patients provider.
            These are the things that medical boards are engaging in and
            you never know when an administrator will give you bad evals
            for asking them a single question, and when they will
            equivocate an honest reply with blaming.
            Would it surprise you that the medical board in MO (and they
            probably aren't alone,) committed six counts of fraud trying
            to reprimand Doctor Antoine Adem for GOOD medical care.
            These physicians on the medical board didn't spend one hour
            looking up the stent guidelines, not did they simply call Dr.
            Adem and say, "hey, can you explain the case to me." The
            Unaccountable medical board attorneys are encouraged by tv
            unaccountable medical board members to win, apparently to
            ignore patient harm, even if it occurred repeatedly.
            The VA Scandal is not limited to the VA, but could occur in
            any hospital in the USA.
            We need to reform medical boards somewhat. You may mock, but
            MO isn't alone, TX appears* to be engaged in abuse of
            discretion. In MO. The judge said that the Board of
            Registration for the Healing Arts conduct was "unfathomable
            and deeply disturbing,"
            The AMA currently opposes the FTC in their effort v the NC
            dental board.
            They say that patient safety is the reason, but it appears to
            be to abuse discretion. Yes, patient harm is significant, but
            boards capriciously evaluate physicians moral character. For
            example, a resident beat the sh!+ out of someone, was
            arrested, and taken to jail, has a mug shot online. The
            resident is of good moral character with the board because the
            resident claimed exactly what the Chair wanted. Nonetheless,
            if the Board investigated, they would find that the claim of
            "documenting fixation time often in lumpectomy specimens (told
            to the ACGME)" is false.
            So never being arrested is considered more unethical than
            beating the sh!t out of someone.
            Do you think Medical Board Members should be held accountable
            and financially liable when they reprimand "by the books,"
            "FDA-approved care."
            They are destroying another physicians life because they
            didn't spend an hour looking up the clinical guidelines.
            My aim is that they are held accountable and have some risk,
            some personal need to render just and equitable decisions when
            evaluating their peers. Instead, as it stands, board members
            committ fraud, reprimand good medical care, and refuse to
            investigate (to even check), potential patient harm that was
            ongoing for months.
            This is not about me, but this is an issue of patient safety.
            For example, reprimanding good medical care and committing
            fraud doesn't help anyone, yet it costs hundreds of thousands
            of dollars in litigation, and it could be prevented by 1 board
            member spending 1 hour reviewing the guidelines. Furthermore,
            they do not permit cross-examination of their claims prior to
            litigation, an essential feature of peer-review groups
            according to the AMA Code of Medical Ethics.

            No one will probably touch this topic, but we need physician
            leaders to step up and identify fraud and reprimanding simple,
            by-the-books, excellent care in the hospital administration,
            peer review groups and medical boards.
            It isn't asking that much if medical board members: "don't
            reprimand excellent, by the books care, or you might be held
            liable."
            If a medical student can figure out the case in an hour, then
            board members of another specialty should
            1. Identify the concern, decide &/or if not certain
            2. Call the physician and say, would you please explain the
            therapeutic rationale for your medical decision making. Or
            perhaps they could ask the doctor to write a letter with the
            rationale. If the judge can figure out the medical board is
            committing fraud & misrepresenting Medical information, then
            medical board members can monitor their rubber stamp more
            closely.

            If you were the medical doctor who provided by the books,
            "FDA-approved," "excellent medical care." To this patient,
            would you want to spend ten hours and two thousand dollars
            teaching the medical board's attorney, in front of the judge,
            why your medical care was ~perfect?
            The medical board walks away unscathed and they used the
            government's money to reprimand excellent medical care.
            State medical boards that work diligently to keep people from
            practicing medicine based on a personal conflict, for which
            resulted in a electronic communication disturbance,
            was not even a misdemeanor, are probably harming patients.
            The idea that physicians must provide evidence of "good moral
            character," to be a physician is drastically flawed.
            Consider if the
            Depaetment leader lied to the ACGME about the department.
            Stating that the care they provided was "by the books" and
            excellent.
            The Board would likely assume what they say is true based on
            academic title. By the way, writing that you are compliant
            with safe patient practices, is NOT the same as doing it.
            For example, if you tell the ACGME that they don't need to
            investigate, ~"we are documenting the ischemic time," no need
            to review our actual surgical pathology lumpectomy reports,
            they won't investigate.
            So who has good moral character, the one who lied and covered
            up patient harm, or the person who reported the harm. Patients
            could be receiving the wrong cancer treatment (w/out
            trastuzumab), and possibly dying early,
            Would you be silent about this?
            If many patients were potentially harmed and then a physician
            lied saying "oh no, we provide good care, and write the
            ischemic time down," but the reports from that time do not
            have the ischemic time, then should you speak up or be
            silent?

       I'm sure that running a medical board isn't easy, thus I offer this
       information for a necessary and prudent discourse that is essential
       in order to figure out how to fix the system.

       Here is a claim that a lawyer made against a doctor. Why do we have
       doctors on the medical board if they don't review the clinical
       validity of these claims before they are filed in court.

       Reprimanding "by the books," "FDA-approved," Medical care is
       probably not helping people.

       Here is from reports of Fraud by the Maryland Medical Board,

       There are many more to come, and physicians are becoming upset with
       medical regulation that favors academic title to patient safety,
       that consider too many letters in the mail more important than
       people dying.

       This is a comment I made on Google Plus to the White House. I do
       not anticipate many will read it, but if one does not try they will
       never succeed.
       Please, also bring accountability to healthcare administration.
       Instead of helping those without medical insurance, or helping
       those who can't afford to eat, the medical board in Missouri spent
       100,000 dollars of tax-payer money to sue Dr. Antoine Adem for
       providing good medical care. In addition, the medical board
       committed six counts of fraud v Dr. Adem. The medical board could
       have spent one hour to review the cardiac stent guidelines and
       realized he was providing good medical care. Instead, they made no
       investigation into his conduct, the lawyers committed six counts of
       fraud, wasted 100,000 dollars of tax payers money, caused his
       patients to go without medical care, cost Dr. Adem approximately
       100,000 of his money, and the board went home being paid for this
       conduct without reprimand or compensating Dr. Adem for their
       harassment and bullying of him. This isn't the only time they have
       tried to reprimand good medical care. Please hold medical board
       members accountable for their decisions. Thank you kindly. -Brett

       Interesting that some think that Medical Boards should have no
       accountability for their actions, in spite of the Board's actions
       actions
       1. Committed fraud, six times versus one cardiologist Dr. Antoine
       Adem. Court case at the length. The judge said the medical board's
       conduct was "unfathomable," "perverse," and more. There is nothing
       protecting patients about this. These physicians are sending their
       lawyers off to commit fraud, are not doing their job by
       reprimanding good medical care. Anyone can reprimand a physician
       for raping a patient. If doctors are not going to apply their
       medical knowledge to their job serving the medical board, then why
       do we need them, or doctors for that matter on the medical board.
       http://bit.ly/FrAUD
       2. After trying to reprimand Dr. Adem for providing good medical
       care, and committing fraud against him six times, and then
       depriving patients of care so they could try and reprimand Dr. Adem
       in court, they ultimately went home both paid and without
       reprimand.
       They reprimanded a cardiologist who they committed fraud against
       six times for forging a letter x1, and then did not reprimand
       themselves. The Medical Board wasted 100,000 dollars wasting
       100,000 dollars of tax-payer dollars prosecuting Dr. Adem for
       providing "by the guidelines," medical care. Thus, the medical
       board both
       2a. Harassed Dr. Adem,
       2b. Committed Fraud six times
       2c. was negligent and did not use their medical knowledge to do
       their job.
       2d. Deprived patients of medical care amidst the shortage of
       physicians
       2e. Wasted $100,000 of tax-payer dollars
       2f. Received payment for their unethical, unprofessional nefarious
       conduct
       2g Made no reparation to Dr. Adem for acting like senseless
       gorillas trying to clobber him with fraudulent information.
       2h. Did not reprimand themselves for a more serious offense than
       that committed by Dr. Adem.
       3. No physician on the medical board bothered to spend a single
       hour reviewing the cardiac stent guidelines, and instead tossed the
       case to their attorney. Why do we need physicians on medical boards
       if they cannot read the stent guidelines and need the judge to do
       it for them?
       4. Poor communication on behalf of the medical board. A physician
       on the medical board could have easily picked up the phone. called
       Dr. Adem at a n agreed-to time and said
       "Dr. Adem would you please explain to me your therapeutic
       rationale. I cannot give you an answer today, but I would like to
       speak with you about your medical reasoning before the Board makes
       any further decisions."
       Instead the Monkeys on the Medical Board tossed the case to the
       attorneys who ran at him mindlessly.
       5. The following website contains 12 cases of unethical medical
       board conduct and more is being added daily. THere are 13 cases if
       you consider North Carolina's recent harassment of a physician for
       lying about having sex with her husband. There is a physician
       shortage, and people will likely die without preventive medical
       care, especially the poor. Given that, the medical board members
       are despicable and without moral compass as they would rather let
       patients die
       than permit a physician who lied about having sex provide patient
       care.
       Furthermore, the Medical Boards do NOTHING proactively to help
       physicians be complaint with the broad and selectively interpreted
       laws. This is in stark contrast to the FDA, CMS, who gives
       physicians a year to get in complaince. It is disgusting that the
       medical board would pressure some nervous woman to where she is
       feared for her life and her career, pressing her about having sex,
       not even harming anyone, and then reprimand her. Medical boards are
       becoming about as intelligent and professional as a drunken
       fraternity club. There is nothing respectable about their
       harassment of doctors for providing good medical care.
       If you would like to share your comments on Medical Board fraud,
       harassment, bullying of doctors, reprimanding FDA-approved care,
       then please see the following website: VA Scandal-2: Medical Board

       Dear Patients,
       Please, if you are willing, and have time, provide you kind
       consideration to how medical regulation should be conducted. The
       question is important because it affects the ability of many people
       to obtain a healthcare.
       1. Physicians should be of good moral character. Physicians are
       people too, and sometimes they make mistakes. For those mistakes
       that have to do with fraud, but fraud related to writing letters,
       what should be done when a Good Doctor who helped many patients
       forges a letter when his boss changes because his prior boss did
       not like him? This is fraud. The law grants him reprimand.
       However we can always change the laws. So please consider the
       following. The lawyers working for the medical, the responsibility
       if the doctors on the medical board, committed six counts of Fraud
       v Dr. Antoine Adem. Again Dr. Aden committed one fraud
       Who should lose their medical license?
       1. Dr. Adem only, because he is a subordinate and it's not okay for
       him to break the current laws.
       2. The medical board members only, they are our leaders and should
       be held to a higher standard. Instead, they engaged in despicable
       conduct, far worse and more numerous than that which De. Adem did.
       3. Dr. Adem And the Medical Board Members.
       4. Neither, Patients come first, if he was providing good care,
       then it is not appropriate for the medical board to kill patients
       through a lack if care simply so they can punish him.
       In Addition , it is dumb law and the medical board wasted 100k if
       tax payer dollars and cost Dr. Adem $100,000 of his own money for
       providing good patient care.

       Why is the Medical Board Committing Fraud?

       Why is the Missouri Medical Board committing fraud? Is a lack of
       legal liability responsible for the Medical Board's negligence and
       repeated acts of reprimanding good medical care? If the medical
       board members could be personally sued through antitrust
       litigation, would they spend an extra hour a year contemplating not
       committing fraud, and thus saving the government at least one
       hundred thousand dollars per year? This post presents a root cause
       analysis of the errors that led the Missouri Medical Board to
       commit six acts of fraud versus Dr. Antoine Adem for having
       provided patients with good medical care.
       The likely reason that the board committed fraud six times against
       Dr. Antoine Adem is due to prejudice. The Missouri Medical Board
       thought that they knew the stent guidelines. I suggest this root
       cause analysis of the medical board's error because it is very
       pertinent to the practice of medicine, medical regulation, and my
       own aims to resume "clinic." The Medical Board did not review the
       literature during their decision making process but relied on the
       following:
       1. A negative evaluation of Dr. Adem written by his ignorant boss;
       2. The Board's experience with a similar case of coronary stenting
       that was characterized by the placement of stents in a vessel with
       less than 50% occlusion, was malpractice, and not indicated. The
       cardiovascular doctor placed merely to make money.
       The board incorrectly presumed that Dr. Aden's case was identical
       to the aforementioned malpractice.
       The Medical Board did not review the medical literature, did not
       review the stent guidelines, nor did they ask/listen-to Dr. Adem's
       therapeutic rationale.
       Due to the failure of the medical board to have their physicians
       exercise evidence-based decision making, they wasted $100,000 of
       tax-payer dollars, committed fraud six times, were paid and not
       reprimanded for their unethical and unprofessional conduct, and
       likely harmed patients through the deprivation of care and
       stressing an already stressed healthcare system.
       Summary: The Missouri Board of Registration for the Healing Arts
       did not appreciate the key difference between the two cases, which
       was the size of the coronary arteries. If the coronary artery
       diameter is less than 4 mm, then a stent may be indicated, even if
       the degree of luminal obstruction is less than 50%. However, the
       case of malpractice occurred when stents were placed in vessels
       larger than 4 mm with less than 50% luminal obstruction.

       Will medical boards continue to committ fraud, harass doctors for
       providing good medical care, and refuse to investigate patient
       harm, the United States Supreme Court will soon decide. Comments
       and suggestions are welcome.

       This post is related to antitrust and is from the NEJM archives.
       Development of Medical Ethics MEDICAL ethics, so-called, had very
       earthy origins. It stemmed not from theorists who speculated airily
       on the nature of the good, but from hardheaded, practical men who
       faced ugly, concrete situations. The framework of medical ethics
       lay not in philosophy but in sociologie phenomena, especially those
       leading to guild organization. A guild was an association of
       workers banded together to protect their common interests and to
       destroy competition. The technic was to obtain a strict monopoly
       enforced by the powers of the state. The guild in return for this
       monopolistic position guaranteed the competence of the workmen,

       Brett Snodgrass to [78]#FTC Greetings, I would like to speak with
       someone at the #FTC about my complaint. I have had my identify
       stolen so many times. sigh. We need to bring the State Medical
       Boards to justice for their crimes. They are entity of the state to
       uphold the statutes and protect the public. They have absolutely no
       oversight, and they are not held accountable for patient safety. If
       they were held accountable for patient safety they would be fired
       when the error rate in hospitals increases. The Medical Boards have
       failed the people of every state and ths occurs at least a million
       times per year. State Medical Boards are one of the most, if not
       the most incompetent government agency. Few other agencies commit
       fraud and are paid for it.

October 14, 2014:  medical regulation background that sets the stage for the
trial.

The Health Care Industry: Where Is It Taking Us?

"MEDICAL PRACTICE AS A COMPETITIVE BUSINESS
       Adding to the competition and cost in our health care system is the
       recent rapid increase in the number of practicing physicians, most
       of whom are specialists. In 1970 there were 153 active physicians
       per 100,000 members of the population; in 1980 there were 192; and
       the number for 1990 was estimated to exceed 220.[97]9 Among these
       new practitioners, the number of specialists is increasing more
       rapidly than that of primary care physicians. When doctors were in
       relatively short supply two or three decades ago, they worried less
       about their livelihood. Now, as the economists would say, we are in
       a buyer's market, in which not only underused hospitals but also
       specialists — available in increasing, sometimes even excessive,
       numbers — are forced to compete for the diminishing number of
       paying patients who are not already part of the managed care
       network.
       How have all these developments affected the practice of medicine?
       In the first place, they have resulted in more regulation of the
       private practice of medicine by third-party payers, who are trying
       to control costs. There is more interference with clinical practice
       decisions, more second-guessing and paperwork, and more
       administrative delays in billing and collecting than ever before,
       as third-party payers attempt to slow down cost increases through
       micromanagement of the medical care system.
       Second, doctors are increasingly threatened by malpractice
       litigation as a strictly business relationship begins to replace
       the trust and mutual confidence that traditionally characterized
       the doctor–patient relationship.
       Third, the courts, which formerly kept the practice of medicine out
       of the reach of antitrust law, now regard the physician as just
       another person doing business, no longer immune from antitrust
       regulation. In 1975 the Supreme Court handed down a landmark
       decision that found that the business activities of professionals
       were properly subject to antitrust law.[98]10 As a consequence,
       physicians can no longer act collectively on matters affecting the
       economics of practice, whether their intent is to protect the
       public or simply to defend the interests of the profession.
       Advertising and marketing by individual physicians, groups of
       physicians, or medical facilities, which used to be regarded as
       unethical and were proscribed by organized medicine, are now
       protected — indeed, encouraged —by the Federal Trade Commission.
       Advertisements now commonly extol the services of individual
       physicians or of hospital and ambulatory facilities staffed by
       physicians. Most of them go far beyond simply informing the public
       about the availability of medical services. Using the slick
       marketing techniques more appropriate for consumer goods, they
       lure, coax, and sometimes even frighten the public into using the
       services advertised.
       I recently saw a particularly egregious example of this kind of
       advertising in the Los Angeles Times.A freestanding imaging center
       in southern California was urging the public to come for magnetic
       resonance imaging (MRI) studies in its new "open air" imager,
       without even suggesting the need for previous examination or
       referral by a physician. The advertisement listed a wide variety of
       common ailments about which the MRI scan might provide useful
       information — a stratagem calculated to attract large numbers of
       worried patients whose insurance coverage would pay the substantial
       fee for a test that was probably not indicated.
       Before it was placed under the protection of antitrust law, such
       advertising would have been discouraged by the American Medical
       Association (AMA) and viewed with disfavor by the vast majority of
       physicians. Now it is ubiquitous, on television and radio, on
       billboards, and in the popular print media. Of course, not all
       medical advertising is as sleazy. Many respectable institutions and
       reputable practitioners advertise in order to bring their services
       to the public's attention. But in medical advertising there is a
       fine line between informing and promoting; as competition grows,
       this line blurs. Increasingly, physicians and hospitals are using
       marketing and public relations techniques that can only be
       described as crassly commercial in appearance and intent.
       Advertising and marketing are just a part of the varied
       entrepreneurial activities in which practicing physicians are now
       engaged. Perceiving the trend toward the industrialization of
       medicine, sensing the threat to their access to paying patients
       from hospitals, HMOs, and other closed-panel insurance plans, and
       feeling the pressures of competition from the growing army of
       medical practitioners, doctors have begun to think of themselves as
       beleaguered businesspersons, and they act accordingly. I
       occasionally hear from physicians expressing this view. For
       example, a doctor from Texas recently sent me a letter saying:
       "Medicine is a service business, despite the fact that it deals
       with human beings and their health problems.... Physicians are an
       economic entity, just like the corner service station." Although I
       suspect many of his colleagues would not appreciate the analogy, I
       am afraid that too many would agree with the writer's opinion about
       the primacy of economic considerations in medical practice. In that
       respect, they would support the oft-expressed views of the leaders
       of the for-profit hospital industry. For example, the executive
       director of the Federation of American Hospitals (the trade
       association of the investor-owned chains) wrote in a letter
       published in the Journal 10 years ago: "I fail to see a difference
       between health services and other basic necessities of life — food,
       housing, and fuel — all of which are more oriented to the profit
       motive than is health care."[99]11
       Of course, the private practice of medicine has always had
       businesslike characteristics, in that practicing physicians earn
       their livelihood through their professional efforts. For the vast
       majority of physicians, however, professional commitments have
       dominated business concerns. There was always more than enough work
       for any physician to do, and few physicians had to worry about
       competition or earning a livelihood. Furthermore, it had long been
       generally accepted that a physician's income should derive
       exclusively from direct services to patients or the supervision of
       such services, not from any entrepreneurial activities.
       All that seems to be changing now in this new era of medical
       entrepreneurialism and health care marketing. Increasing numbers of
       physicians have economic interests in health care that go beyond
       direct services to patients or the supervision of such services.
       The AMA, which formerly proscribed entrepreneurialism by
       physicians, now expressly allows it, with some caveats, apparently
       recognizing that a very substantial fraction of practitioners
       supplement their income by financial interests in all sorts of
       health care goods, services, and facilities.
       The arrangements are too numerous and varied to describe in full
       here, so I shall simply cite some of them, a few of which I have
       already alluded to: (1) practitioners hold limited partnerships in
       for-profit diagnostic-laboratory facilities, to which they refer
       their patients but over which they exercise no professional
       supervision; (2) surgeons hold limited partnerships in for-profit
       ambulatory surgery facilities to which they refer their own
       patients; (3) office-based practitioners make deals with
       prescription-drug wholesalers, who supply them with drugs that the
       physicians prescribe for their patients and for which they charge
       retail prices; (4) physicians purchase prostheses at reduced rates
       from manufacturers and make a profit in addition to the
       professional fees they receive for implanting the prostheses; and
       (5) practitioners own interests in imaging units to which they
       refer their patients. Most of the free-standing imaging units are
       owned by investor-owned businesses, but some were originally owned
       by radiologists in private practice who have told me that they were
       persuaded to form joint partnerships with their referring
       physicians because these physicians threatened to refer their
       patients elsewhere.
       Such arrangements create conflicts of interest that undermine the
       traditional role of the doctor.[100]12 In the minds of some
       physicians, the old Samaritan tradition of our profession has now
       given way to the concept of a strict business contract between
       doctor and patient. According to this view, good physicians are
       simply honest and competent vendors of medical services who are
       free to contract for whatever services they are willing to provide
       and patients or their insurers are willing to pay for. Society has
       no more stake in the practice of medicine than in the conduct of
       any other business activity, and therefore no right to interfere
       with the terms of the private contract between doctor and patient."

 Commentary references: [101]http://bit.ly/MedBoardFraud
Is it equitable for unaccountable medical board members to commit fraud
whilst doctors that were providing good care are maliciously attacked by
these unethical physiciains. The medical board committed six counts of fraud
v. Dr. Antoine Adem for providing good medical care. This isn't the only time
that they have engaged in such unethical and unprofession conduct.

       October 14, 2014: regulatory background.
       Nearly every doctor in the country is working diligently to oppose
       the FTC and good lawyers such as Jarod Bona are bravely working to
       uphold the law.
       They are supposed to ensure quality, but permitting certain doctors
       to oversee fraud, & according to the medical board's reasoning,
       they should be as liable as the rest of us. I support transparency,
       but selectively reprimanding doctors with permanent revocation of
       licensure helps no one. First, of all, I was 100 miles from
       patients, and if the Board was concerned about patient care, then
       they would have investigated months* of poor care. Here is the
       reference that, by the board's reasoning of "oversight
       responsibility," the medical board members are not innocent in the
       eyes of medical regulation.
       The Following report describes the Missouri Medical Board's case
       nature of reprimanding.
       ===================================================================
       =========================================
       7. In June 1978, Brockenbrough left Baltimore to practice at the
       University of Pennsylvania and was able to obtain licensure based
       on his recent FLEX. He was a thoracic surgery resident and
       assistant instructor in surgery. He had no licensure or malpractice
       problems during his time in Pennsylvania.
       8. In September 1980, Brockenbrough moved to Los Angeles,
       California, to practice. He practiced with hospital privileges at
       12 or 13 different hospitals for 17 years.
       The Malpractice Claim
       9. In 1981, Brockenbrough faced the only malpractice claim of his
       career. The claim involved a woman suffering from reflux
       esophagitis. The patient was unable to sleep because when lying
       flat she would get heartburn from a reflux of stomach contents.
       10. During the surgery to correct the condition, the patient
       coughed due to insufficient anesthesia, and the tube that
       Brockenbrough inserted into the esophagus perforated the esophagus.
       11. Brockenbrough made the patient n.p.o. and treated the
       perforation with antibiotics and IV fluids. Brockenbrough visited
       the patient the morning after the procedure, and she was “doing
       fine.”
       *******************************************
       12. Someone transferred the patient from the intensive care unit
       and fed her lunch. The food passed through the perforation to cause
       infection.
       13. Brockenbrough operated again to correct the problem, but the
       patient died weeks later due to complications from an incorrect
       dosage of morphine administered by a nurse.
       *************************************************
       ===================================================================
       =====================================================
       [102]#unfathomable. Someone fed the person. The medical board
       reprimanded Dr. Brockenbrough.
       [103]#Legislative [104]#Judicial
       Doctors aren't perfect, but reprimanding & denying a doctor a
       license primarily because someone feeds a person with an
       ***esophageal performation*** is not equitable.
       MEDICAL PRACTICE AS A COMPETITIVE BUSINESS
       ===================================================================
       =================================================
       The AMA used to oppose Medicare, but my impression is now they
       largely think it is a good thing for both doctors and society.
       Thus, I implore other physicians not to let the AMA's opposition to
       the [105]Federal Trade Commissiondissuade you from voicing public
       support in their upcoming United States Supreme Court of America
       case. The AMA opposed the FTC back in the 1970s regarding
       advertising.
       Third, the courts, which formerly kept the practice of medicine out
       of the reach of antitrust law, now regard the physician as just
       another person doing business, no longer immune from antitrust
       regulation. In 1975 the Supreme Court handed down a landmark
       decision that found that the business activities of professionals
       were properly subject to antitrust law.10 As a consequence,
       physicians can no longer act collectively on matters affecting the
       economics of practice, whether their intent is to protect the
       public or simply to defend the interests of the profession.
       Advertising and marketing by individual physicians, groups of
       physicians, or medical facilities, which used to be regarded as
       unethical and were proscribed by organized medicine, are now
       protected — indeed, encouraged —by the Federal Trade Commission.
       [106]http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199109193251205
       I would argue that the late Dr. Relman has a "Harvard-view," of
       medical practice & peer review.
       Not all [107]#AAMC training programs are equitable such
       as [108]#Harvard and[109]#UCDavis. When the Program Director does
       not know the difference between a sign and a symptom, and
       reprimands the resident for their own shortcoming, without any
       descriptive documentation, the assessment is disparaging, and might
       be considered abusive by some. In such cases it is important to get
       a [110]#Lawyer involved early.
       Next, when covering the topic of peer-review, it is important to
       distinguish
       1. Disciplinary peer-review: primary aim to punish someone: typical
       of pathology departments, and the hospital medical executive
       committees, with "disruptive doctors." Some physicians get upset
       when they see administrative negligence harming women month after
       month. They have done everything within their ability to protect
       patients from the department's poor care, but cannot do it
       constantly.
       2. Surgical Morbidity and mortality: & sometimes internal medicine
       & other specialties. These types of [111]#PeerReview has
       constructive purposes, and it is important to not conflate the two
       as they are drastically different in purposes and effect.
       Some physicians suggest that peer-review will be affected by
       anti-trust activities. In reality it should be. However, to defend
       the unethical practice of the current "peer review, aside form
       M&M," many doctors say that performance improvements will not go
       forward. Interestingly, outside of morbidity & mortality-type
       peer-review, many committees tacitly collude and drastically abuse
       their power of immunity. Many of the peer-review(non M&M) are not
       conducted in compliance with the AMA-code of medical ethics. I
       added my comments to the website, but they were likely too cutting
       and removed. As a physician, I think it is important to be
       objective, and if the actions that were conducted were cutting,
       then cutting words would be most apt to describe them.
       *******************************************
       12. Someone transferred the patient from the intensive care unit
       and fed her lunch. The food passed through the perforation to cause
       infection.
       13. Brockenbrough operated again to correct the problem, but the
       patient died weeks later due to complications from an incorrect
       dosage of morphine administered by a nurse.
       *************************************************
       As you can see from the above, this is only one of many examples
       where the Missouri Medical Boar demonstrated a lack of common
       sense, equity, fairness, and objective concern for the patient who
       is left without affordable care. The number of cases of medical
       board misconduct are growing, and in my humble opinion, the federal
       government should either (1) let physicians sue individual medical
       board members for their fraudulent crimes as Dr. Antoine Adem
       should be entitled to, or (2) provide quality control, oversight,
       and accountability of medical regulation. When one state's actions
       have immediate effect in every other state, the action is
       synonymous with a "monopoly," and the states should be held
       accountable to federal antitrust laws.
       Kindest regards,

       Medical Board Fraud reported in California. The prosecuting
       attorney committed fraud in a manner similar to the Missouri
       Medical Board. What we need for patient safety, is better
       monitoring of physicians, earlier monitoring, gather more data,
       before repeatedly ignorantly reprimanding good medical care.
       Medical Board fraud isn't secondary to the attorney, or the
       incompetence of the Board Members, the current system is
       unaccountable, harmful to patients, and not helpful as they claim.
       Assign Board Members that will be accountable for their decisions.
       NOt those that want to be able to commit six acts of fraud and not
       pay a single penny to those that they harmed.

       Medical Board Brutality - The Plot Thickens...
       Opinion by Consumer Advocate [114]Tim Bolen
       Thursday, August 25th, 2005
       Last Friday, August 19th, 2005 I sent out a newsletter called
       "[115]Medical Board Brutality."  It was about the newest antics of
       the California Medical Board Staff - an organization, I believe, to
       be completely corrupt - and not worth saving.  Like the story about
       Hercules and the Aegean stables, the best thing that could happen
       is for someone to re-route the Sacramento river right through 1426
       Howe Avenue (the medical board offices) - and for the same
       reason....
       The responses were startling.  In short, my disdain for the
       Administrative Law System, and the way it is abused against
       licensed health professionals, is SHARED worldwide.
       I want to thank all of those who responded with a letter to the
       Presiding Judge of the Appeals Court.  If you haven't yet sent
       yours in, please do so.  You can get the details about what to do
       by clicking [116]here.
       In short, my earlier newsletter details an assault against a "lay
       representative" helping people through the Administrative law
       process. Charles Benninghoff had complained to an Administrative
       Law Judge that  the Medical Board, and the prosecutor in the case,
       had "biased" the State's witness - a violation of the agency's own
       rules of conduct - and the State retaliated against Benninghoff,
       claiming he was "practicing law without a license..."
       The Medical board went to a "friendly" Superior Court Judge and got
       an order seizing Benninghoff's office, leaving his clients in the
       lurch.  Benninghoff filed an Appeal to the Fourth District Court of
       Appeals - and here we are.
       So, how is the plot thickening?
       Well, the situation is WORSE than I originally indicated.  The
       corruption is far deeper, and far more extensive, than I thought.
       It extends deep into the bowels of the California Attorney
       General's (AG) office.  Sit back, and read this...
       It turns out that the whole case against Charles Benninghoff
       centers around two letters, so-called "legal opinions" of two
       employees of the Attorney General's office, one named Alfredo
       Terrazas, and the other, Robert McKim Bell...
       So, who are these people?
       First I'll tell you who Alfredo Terrazas is.
       Those of you who have been long time readers of my newsletter will
       remember the series about the infamous [117]"California Medical
       Board v. Sinaiko" case - and the huge cost, and embarrassment, it
       caused the California Medical Board over the seven years it took to
       complete.  It was the "Sinaiko" case that first brought the wrath
       of the California Legislature on the staff, in the form of an
       official "Enforcement Monitor."
       The "star" of the show, on the Medical Board's side, during
       the "Sinaiko" case, the man that lost the biggest case in the
       medical board's history, was prosecutor Alfredo Terrazas.  It was
       his "legal opinions" and his grasp  of the law (or lack of it),
       that was so contemptuously shot down by the California Court of
       Appeals. Terrazas's case, and his concept of what constituted
       health care, and his concept of the the law surrounding health
       care, brought together the largest, angriest, and most
       diverse, group of opposition I've ever seen anywhere.  And, it was
       deserved.
       The hallmark of the "Sinaiko" case was Terrazas's flagrant
       prosecutorial misconduct laid out in a fifty-one page document I'm
       going to give you access to right here.  But the keynote was
       Terrazas's continued use of a "fake" witness (Samantha Simons),
       with a "fake" complaint.  You can read about it, and view the
       documents , by clicking here.
       Like in the situation Benninghoff complained about, Terrazas not
       only sought to "influence" the State's witnesses in the case, but
       he, against the orders of a Judge, slipped the"fake" document, by
       the "fake" witness, into the presentation to the appointed Medical
       Board members as "Exhibit #21."
       In other words, there is a long history of abuse of the system, and
       misconduct on the part of the Medical Board staff and the AGs
       assigned to that function.  And, Mrs. Terrazas's little boy Freddy
       is right in the forefront.
       Why is this important?  Read on...
       As you may remember, the support network for "Sinaiko" ended up
       including not just the North American Health Freedom Movement, and
       the Progress in Medicine Foundation, but the Center for Public
       Interest Law (the group that actually WROTE the California Medical
       Practices Act), the California Medical Association (CMA), The
       American Association of Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), the Union
       of American Physicians & Surgeons (UAPD), and many others - just
       too many to name here.
       Unlikely bed-fellows - on most days.
       The "Sinaiko" case brought factors together, in California, which
       significantly changed the way medicine is regulated.  For, the
       general feeling was that the whole situation surrounding
       the "Sinaiko"  case was just plain wrong.  The finger pointing was,
       for the most part, ALL at Alfredo Terrazas.
       The cause of all of the "Sinaiko" commotion was the misconduct, and
       decidedly "bigoted," and clearly "anti-due process" legal opinions,
       and maneuvering, of Alfredo Terrazas.  Simply, (1)  Terrazas felt
       that it was improper for a defendant (in this case, Sinaiko) to be
       able to defend himself/herself.  He convinced an Administrative Law
       Judge, named Ruth Astle (who slept through much of the hearings) to
       disallow any of Sinaiko's top-of-the-line "expert
       witnesses," basically, because they DISAGREED with his witnesses,
       and he, Terrazas, claimed that (go ahead and laugh), that "only
       medicine that was generally accepted in the mainstream was allowed
       in California - everything else was health fraud."
       The California Appeals Court, in the "Sinaiko" case, I think, must
       have thought that they'd run across a total nut case when they read
       Terrazas's arguments - for their reaction, and their ruling, was
       appropriate to that finding.
       With Terrazas, it's not about justice, or disciplining bad doctors,
       its about "winning."
       Terrazas bragged to Sinaiko's first attorney that "I never lose a
       case.  I use the 'death of a thousand cuts' attack.  I make as many
       accusations as possible so that even if you win on 999,  I still
       win on one.   And, I'm going to take your client's license to
       practice medicine away from him."
       Shula Edelkind, the Executive Director of the [118]Progress in
       Medicine Foundation, the group that raised the money for
       the "Sinaiko" defense, also gathered information to help Sinaiko.
       One of the most interesting documents (fifty-one pages long) I've
       seen come out of the case is called:
       "Request for a Formal Investigation of: Mr. Alfredo Terrazas, State
       Bar # 78403, Deputy Atty Gen of CA, 2101 Webster Street, 12th
       Floor, Oakland, CA  94612-3049, (510) 622-2220, for misconduct in
       his prosecution of the case of Medical Board of California v.
       Robert Sinaiko, MD"
       In that Terrazas did the following: False Statement of Fact,
       Concealed Material Information, Misquoted Scientific Materials,
       Misquoted the Testimony, Produced Inappropriate “Experts”,
       Misquoted and Misread the Medical Charts of Patients, Betrayed the
       Confidentiality of the Patients, Made Inappropriate Assumptions as
       to the Aim of Therapy, Cited as Authority a Decision that had been
       Overruled, Introduced into Evidence Materials Barred from
       Consideration, Colluded with Another to Deceive the Court, Used
       Slander, violated the ABA Code of Professional Responsibility, EC
       7-13, Attempted to Show “Guilt by Association,” Took Advantage of
       Defense Naiveté ....

       @TimothySandefur @PacificLegal @CatoInstitute
       If the individual medical board members acted with interest of the
       State and not of themselves, then why did they not investigate and
       reprimand each of the medical board members for
       1. Committing fraud x6 v. Dr. Antoine Adem
       2. Demonstrating a lack of competent medical knowledge.
       Every physician schould know how to review the guidelines to
       evaluate the medical care in very simple cases. A medical student
       could have determined that the care provided by Dr. Antoine Adem
       was appropriated. Instead, the unaccountable medical board members
       tossed the case to their attorneys and had them commit fraud x6 v.
       Dr.Adem.
       @TimothySandefur @PacificLegal @CatoInstitute
       The claim of patient safety doesn't support the need for antitrust.
       The medical board isn't responsible for population health which
       they have caused a net harm to by limiting the number of
       physicians, many of whom have better records and qualifications
       than the board members. In addition they have failed miserably to
       reduce medical errors.
       The medical board members frequently review other practitioners
       with great partiality, and they refuse to reprimand themselves for
       incompetence. In addition, they refuse to reprimand themselves for
       overseeing the commission of six counts of fraud v. Dr. Antoine
       Adem. Their "need," for antitrust is highlighted by consideration
       of the often-careless, low-quality nature of their medical
       regulation. They repeatedly reprimand doctors for "by-the-books,"
       "excellent," "FDA-approved," medical care. It shouldn't be a
       surprise that many of the present board members want immunity. We
       need to appoint people that take their job seriously, do not
       repeatedly reprimand good medical care, put patients before
       prestige, and collectively demonstrate the medical knowledge of a
       second year medical student or above.
       @TimothySandefur @PacificLegal @CatoInstitute
       If current physicians on State Boards want immunity to commit
       fraud, and selectively interpret and enforce the rules and
       statutes, then I humbly suggest that we can do better.
       We can do better than killing 1000 patients per day by beginning to
       apply peer review with equity and accountability in the form of
       liability.
       Who does their job and says: I will go to work, commit fraud x6,
       bully doctors with more training than myself, demonstrate
       incompetence and repeatedly reprimand doctors for providing good
       medical care, reprimand those doctors who report patient harm and I
       still should be paid for it.?
       Parenthetically, the board members are paid $50 per day, but their
       lawyers are paid about $110 per hour. Why are we paying lawyers to
       exclusively run State Boards. The financial impetus is for them to
       not review the case, to not utilize common sense, to not review the
       guidelines, and to send their lawyer on another frivolous lawsuit
       that does nothing to improve patient safety or the quality of care.

       Medical Board Doctors are clearly deluded with #narcissism. They
       want unlimited power without accountability. They commit numerous,
       perverse, malicious acts that are worse than that which the doctors
       they reprimand have committed. They use the State's money not to
       investigate patient harm, but to reprimand the reporting of it!
       The medical board would like say that bullying people is unethical.
       Similar to how they bullied Dr. Antoine Adem out of $100,000 in
       legal funds when they could have spent one hour reviewing the
       clinical practice guidelines. What good are medical boards for
       patient safety if they prejudge based on limited evidence.
       Accepting without critical scrutiny lies from the DIO to the ACGME
       about patient care, definitely highlights systematic problems in
       healthcare. I'm not the first to notice that if you speakup they
       will be quick to call it unprofessional. Parenthetically SCOTUS has
       upheld three cases of free speech v. States in the last year. 1. A
       whistleblower from a southern state, 2. Right to sue states for
       political speech they claim is false, and 3. Right to protest at
       abortion clinics;

       This is the second page from Dr. Adem's case where the medical
       board committed six acts of fraud against him in order to deceive
       the judge.

       This is fraud from the Texas Medical Board in they fraudulently
       filed a "false advertising."
       Overall he said future studies are needed, repeatedly stated that
       their are side effects, and the Texas Medical Board nonetheless
       reprimanded him for "false advertising."
       Why should they not, they are completely immune, they can commit as
       much fraud as they like and no one can do anything. Is it really
       that surprising that 35 states have received threats or actual
       violence has been attempted. I wouldn't do that because I think it
       is morally wrong, but it's hard to think much well of the medical
       board members, quite possibly amongst the most corrupt and perverse
       members of society. Reprimanding the reporting of patient harm
       without investigating.

       State Medical Board regulation should be more similar to
       this.'https://plus.google.com/101622158432432263442/posts/CVwVzhevb
       eg
       Instead the Medical Board Members in Missouri Pre-judge or
       predetermine what data to gather, what to investigate, and what to
       reprimand. For example:
       The State Medical Board committed six counts of fraud v. Dr. Adem
       for providing good medical care. The Medical Board Members commit
       crimes more heinous, than those they reprimand. In addition, a
       clinic has loaned me many thousand dollars to sue the medical
       board. The State Medical Boards desperately need federal oversight.
       Whoever said that it was a "good idea," to give a group of
       physicians absolute immunity and no oversight was probably
       narcissistic. Kind regards

       #[126]Fraud [127]#FraudWatch +American Medical Association (AMA)
       +American College of Cardiology
       Greetings, as Telemedicine moves forward, we need to do something
       effective about Medical Boards such as Missouri. They commit fraud
       and then reprimand other doctors, such as Dr. Antoine Adem for
       lesser moral wrongs. They have completely lost sight of the purpose
       of physicians. They have no accountability for public health, for
       overall patient safety. They ignorantly and incompletely reprimand
       doctors for
       both good medical care and numerous other incompetently documented
       claims.
       Consider the case of Dr. Antoine Adem, who was helping patients,
       providing good medical care, healing the sick. The Missouri Medical
       Board, ignorantly, and probably somewhat maliciously refused to
       spend one hour to review the cardiac stent guidelines and
       reprimanded Dr. Adem six times in court. In addition the Missouri
       Medical Board caused patients in the State to go without medical
       care while they spent $100,000 plus of the States Money committing
       fraud. Eventually he was reprimanded for forging a signature. Okay,
       it is wrong. He did provide good patient care though. What is most
       perverse. Is that the Medical Board Members demonstrated
       incompetence, unethical, and unprofessional conduct when they
       commissioned the act of fraud against him x6. Whatever physician
       thinks that Medical Boards should be immune to commit fraud and
       repeatedly reprimand good medical care as they have repeatedly done
       should be evaluated for being a sociopath, and undergo a series of
       personality inventories, on various days. The lawyer on the medical
       board did not even know what PubMed is, and he was trying to say
       that I was not competent. The Medical Board staff is only paid $50
       dollars per day, and the lawyer is paid 110 per hour. The Medical
       Board Members should be expected to use their medical training to
       prevent, and not enable the harassment of multiple doctors who were
       providing good medical care. Furthermore, if the physicians who
       "serve," on the State Medical Board were interested in the affairs
       of the State and did not co-opt their position of authority for
       their own interests, they would reprimand themselves for fraud x
       6.
       Medical Board Members are still forgoing their medical training and
       reprimanding doctors for providing by-the-books, FDA-approved,
       Medical care.
       State Medical Boards need to be limited in their authority. Per the
       Judge, the Missouri Board of Registration for the Healing Arts
       committed six counts of fraud v. Dr. Antoine Adem and they did not
       reprimand themselves or their own medical licenses for either fraud
       or incompetence.

       This is the link to the Burzynski case and the related fraud. Would
       any reasonable person file a claim of inappropriate advertising?
       These crooks on the Texas Medical Board have no active state
       oversight and no regard for the law.
