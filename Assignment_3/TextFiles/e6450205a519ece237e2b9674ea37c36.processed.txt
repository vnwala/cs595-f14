   [4]Boy(s) of Rock and Roll
   posted on June 3rd, 2014

   Here’s the thing about my kids…they are hilarious on a daily basis. I
   realize I have an incredible bias but I think even a casual observer
   would label them funny. The problem is they both have just enough of my
   shyness to give them pause whenever they know they are being watched
   and especially captured on film. It would seem though that Chase is
   coming a little out of his shell a bit. Lately he’s been willing to
   perform on cue, even letting me catch a few magic moments with my
   phone.

   I recently introduced them to one of my favorite childhood movies, The
   Chipmunk Adventure. The first time we watched it they didn’t seem too
   interested but the next day they fought over the DVD at nap time, and
   have continued to fight over it every day since. We happened to be
   watching various clips from the movie on YouTube when Chase broke out
   in dance.

   He tried SO hard to copy all of the moves but bless his heart he got
   his gracefulness and coordination – or lack there of – from me.

   I’m suddenly very concerned about how I actually look during Zumba
   classes.

   [10]May 30. Five

   Chaser, Five. Last week you went and got another year older. Tomorrow
   you finish your first year of school (even if it is just practice
   Kindergarten). An entire year of drop offs and pick ups, packing
   lunches, school programs, awards ceremonies, class trips. I can’t
   believe how much you’ve grown this year. You went to school a timid
   toddler too shy to speak to anyone and today I watched you race around
   the park with all the friends you’ve made. [...]
   [11]December 19. Merry Happy Everything

   Hello friends! I know it’s been a little sparse around these parts but
   I just had to come back to participate in the 5th Annual Bloggy Holiday
   Card Exchange (partly because I fear the wrath of Meghan). In all
   seriousness the friends I have made through this blog, as well as
   twitter and facebook, have been some of the best I’ve ever had. I can’t
   thank you all enough for being there through some of the best and worst
   times [...]
   [12]April 30. After the Intermission

   Hello friends. It’s been awhile, eh? If by chance you’re new here then,
   well, you won’t have noticed my nearly 6 month absence. I know! Six
   months! That’s a long time, yo! It’s not like I wasn’t around, I just
   haven’t been here. I haven’t felt like writing. Or I’ve felt like
   writing but the words I wanted to share weren’t mine or just weren’t
   ready to be put in the open. A lot has happened in the last six [...]
   [13]November 18. Katelyn – Two Years Old

   Dear Kate, How in the world is it that you are two years old already?
   It’s so cliche but time really does seem to be moving at warp speed. In
   the last six months you have morphed into a full fledged person. For
   such a tiny little person you have no trouble what so ever making your
   every feeling heard and/or understood. I could make a 500 page
   flip-book comprised of only your facial expressions. Your vocabulary is
   growing by [...]

       She found a better place to sleep. More comfy than the back of the
       couch apparently.
