[6]Never Forgotten

   September 11th, 2013 | Author: [7]Vicki

   We still remember. We still mourn. Those we lost are not forgotten.
   Never forgotten. This post is an update to what I’ve written in the
   past to commemorate this day. It’s been twelve years since the attack
   on September 11, 2001. And still yet the blink of an eye. As time
   passes, there are those who seem to no longer care. I will always care.
   I will always remember.

   I was on my computer that fateful day, reading email. When, a little
   before 9:00 Eastern time, my mom came and told me a plane had flown
   into the North Tower of the World Trade Center. I changed over to one
   of the news channels just in time to see United Flight 175 strike the
   South Tower. Shock. Horror. And then immense pride at how our citizens
   pulled together to help one another.

   The horror continued at 9:37 when American Airlines Flight 77 flew into
   the Pentagon in Washington, DC. United Flight 93 was slated to strike
   either the United States Capitol or the White House, but thanks to the
   incredibly brave efforts of the passengers on that plane, they crashed
   near Shanksville, Pennsylvania at 10:03.

   At approximately 9:59, the South Tower pancaked after burning for
   nearly an hour. It was the most chilling scene I’ve ever seen in my
   life. And the intervening years hasn’t changed that. It was followed by
   the collapse of the North Tower at 10:28. Its collapse brought about
   the eventual collapse of 7 World Trade Center, an adjacent building.

   We lost 2,977 people that day. Some were foreigners but they were all
   ours. They will always be ours.

   To those who lost loved ones, my heart goes out to you today. And I
   leave you with this moving tribute video.

[9]Happy Constitution Day!

   September 17th, 2012 | Author: [10]Vicki

   On this date in 1787, the United States Constitution was signed. I urge
   everyone to take time to read it. You might be surprised by what’s in
   there. And what isn’t.
