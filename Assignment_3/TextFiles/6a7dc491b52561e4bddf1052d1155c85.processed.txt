   What makes you really mad?
   A lot of things like when people throw around disabilities as an insult
   or make fun of people who are disabled or think it's funny/amusing when
   others do it. If any of the above applies to you, you are sick and I
   hope you rot in Hell. :)

   You have to inform Twitter or something I think there's a file report
   for that. I don't know how else to help her. That choice is hers and if
   she won't listen to you right now, she won't listen no matter what.

   If you were to write a book what would it be about?
   It would be based on my life because people need to see what real life
   is actually like rather than those silly novels that resemble none of
   the cold truths. I'd especially want to emphasis the racism against me
   and my religion, having an autistic brother, and growing through a
   split between my parents because my dad is a dick and decided to cheat.
   I don't know but I want it to be something meaningful and that people
   can actually relate to or learn from.
