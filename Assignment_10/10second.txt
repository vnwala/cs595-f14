Read Stuff, You Should22<----->Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001538/">Jonny Lee Miller</a>, 41.<br /><br />Some good stuff:<br /><br />1. I didn't know <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/the-world/2013/11/the-new-fashion-for-national-security-councils/">the Brits had set up a US-like National Security Council</a>, and that other nations were getting in on it. Gideon Rachman explains. I assume, of course, that the big problem in the UK is coordinating the efforts of the Ministry of Administrative Affairs with what's going on over at Silly Walks.<br /><br />2. <a href="http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2013/11/ageless_pressler_eyes_historic.php">Larry Pressler is (sort of) back!</a> Eric Ostermeier is all over the election, and the distinction he would hold if he (improbably) wins back a Senate seat. Pressler, last seen when defeated in 1996, would be, yes, <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2011/03/buddy-roemer-captain-bateson-class.html">a Bateson class Senate candidate</a>. I really want that to catch on; perhaps the low odds of it happening have something to do with how I have to look it up every time I mention it to remember the Kelsey Grammer character name. But still: Bateson class candidates. Use it.<br /><br />3. More evidence that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2013/11/14/about-as-many-people-say-theyve-been-abducted-by-space-aliens-as-say-theyve-committed-voter-fraud/">voter impersonation -- you know, the "reason" for voter ID -- just doesn't exist</a>. Henry Farrell discusses new research. <br /><br />4. Faced with John Kerry's inability to convince his former colleagues to back the administration's negotiations with Iran, Dan Drezner <a href="http://drezner.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/11/14/a_short_qa_on_sanctioning_iran">gives it a try</a>. Minus the show of respect that the Secretary of State presumably used.<----->General
Impeachment!<----->Well, not the president. Just the Attorney General. And not actual impeachment; just a few radicals <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/house-republicans-eric-holder-impeachment-99845.html?hp=r1">planning to introduce articles of impeachment</a> today.<br /><br />Ah, but this is as good an opportunity as any to admit I was pretty much dead wrong about this one. I <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2010/02/impeachment-update.html">thought</a> someone would formally introduce articles of impeachment against Barack Obama long ago. Not that they would actually go ahead an impeach him.<br /><br />I will note that my prediction wasn't just "someone" -- I picked Michele Bachmann. Which, granted, wasn't really a wild stretch, but it turns out she's one of the group gunning for Holder. So I'm not entirely, totally wrong. Just missed the target. And the date, by three years. And they're not even picking a symbolic date, at least as far as I know. And she's apparently not even the lead on it. So, really, well, that's pretty bad predicting.<br /><br />OK, as predictions go, this one wasn't entirely, well, scientific. Just having a little fun. But, alas (or not I suppose), wrong.<br /><br />Good predictions? As of today, that goes to commenter Drew:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">I'll be the contrarian and say that none of them will, barring any significant crime (which I strongly doubt will happen).</blockquote>A tentative congratulations to Drew. Nice work! <br /><br />And congratulations, also tentative but so far, to the GOP House leadership for somehow keeping anyone from filing impeachment against the president.<----->Conservatives
Electoral Effects of the...Oh, C'mon, People, Really?<----->Sometimes, I think it helps to be a solid 1500 miles away from Washington. Or maybe it helps to have read a little history. Or maybe I'm just an old guy.<div><br /></div><div>Anyway: we're at a point at which even Jonathan Chait, <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/11/congressional-democrats-freak-out-over-obamacare.html">writing against panic</a>, says that "the current sense of dread enveloping the Democratic Party has a very real basis. President Obamas poll numbers are plunging to unprecedented depths."</div><div><br /></div><div>Yes, it's all massively overstated.</div><div><br /></div><div>Plunging? His approval (and some associated numbers) have definitely dropped. I suppose "plunge" is subjective, but <a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/obama-job-approval#!">HuffPollster's estimate</a>, set for "less smoothing" and therefore (over?) sensitive to recent polls, is that he's lost maybe 2.5 percentage points over the last five or so weeks. He's been losing ground all year including, mostly likely, during the shutdown. Depending on what adjustments one does, that might have accelerated after the shutdown, or maybe not. It doesn't sound like a "plunge" to me.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Obama's popularity is probably at the low point of his presidency (again, depending on the adjustments, he's either a bit below or a bit above his previous low. But it's not any kind of unusually low low point (he's nowhere near Truman, Carter, Nixon, W.), there's no particular reason to expect the slump to continue, and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/11/12/lets-kill-off-this-myth-about-second-term-presidents/">myths aside</a> no reason to believe he won't recover if the news turns better. Granted, it's hard to know what to expect from healthcare.gov, but it's not as if it's getting worse over time. I'm not saying his numbers will go up. Just that it's more or less equally likely as further drops.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>(Actually...if I had to guess, I'd say a run of either stability or improvement is probably more likely, at least if the next budget deadlines come and go quietly. Gallup's economic confidence index has been steadily recovering from its shutdown/debt limit plunge -- yes, that one was a real plunge -- and Jamelle Bouie is right that the economy is a very big part of presidential approval, although I think he somewhat understates the ability of other events to matter).</div><div><br /></div><div>As for electoral effects? I wrote an item <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/10/electoral-effects-of-shutdown.html">dismissing direct electoral effects</a> of the shutdown against Republicans back last month; that post pretty much works now, in reverse for effects against Democrats. I should say: it's far easier for sentiment against the president to translate into midterm electoral losses than it is for feelings against the out-party. So if Obama is unpopular in November 2014, it will hurt Democrats. But today's frenzy about the ACA is going to be mostly forgotten by then, one way or another, just as the shutdown seems forgotten today. That's probably even true, believe it or not, if the program totally collapses, although I don't think that's going to happen.</div><div><br /></div><div>Anyway, Obama's approval ratings have in fact fallen from the mid-40s to the low-40s, and over the course of the year from around 50 to the low 40s. It's obviously not good news for him, but it seems a lot less dramatic than a lot of the chatter this week would have it be.&nbsp;</div><----->General
Read Stuff, You Should23<----->Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000624/">Laura San Giacomo</a>, 51. Perhaps she doesn't want to do it, but otherwise difficult to understand why she's not starring on one of those TVLand sitcoms. Actually, how about a TVLand sitcom with her, Amy Yasbeck, Hector Elizondo, and Jason Alexander? Isn't that a totally plausible cast? And, yeah, I'd watch it if it was on. It'd be better than the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100405/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_41">last thing</a> they did together.<br /><br />Back to business: there's always good stuff:<br /><br />1. Good Aaron Blake analysis of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/11/13/are-tea-party-groups-more-interested-in-purity-or-poking-the-bear/">what Tea Party and other radical Republican organizations look for </a>when endorsing.<br /><br />2. Nice back and forth this week about genetics and politics research. First, Larry Bartels argues that the research is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2013/11/12/your-genes-influence-your-political-views-so-what/">unlikely to pass the "so what?" test</a>.<br /><br />3. Hans Noel <a href="http://mischiefsoffaction.blogspot.com/2013/11/what-kind-of-genes-did-william-jennings.html">follows up</a> on that, and plugs his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Political-Ideologies-Parties-Cambridge-Psychology/dp/110762052X/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1384288570&amp;sr=1-3">new, upcoming, book</a> (which, from what I know of his work, should be excellent).<br /><br />4. Some <a href="http://prowag.me/2013/11/13/a-response-to-your-genes-influence-your-political-views-so-what/">dissent</a> from Mike Wagner. I'm with Bartels in the skeptical camp (although I'm not even remotely expert enough to discuss this stuff for real), but read both sides.<br /><br />5. Not really related, but perhaps more interesting for those of you who aren't political scientists: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2013/11/13/no-good-looks-dont-win-elections/">good looking candidates don't really have an electoral advantage</a>.<----->General
Gridlock/Polarization<----->National Journal is running a funny-looking chart of <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/this-is-what-congressional-gridlock-looks-like-in-1-chart-20131113">partisan polarization in the House with this explanatio</a>n:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">If you're looking for a quick fact to explain congressional gridlock, it's this: In the 113th Congress, only 59 members have voted with the majority of their party less than 90 percent of the time (20 Republicans and 39 Democrats).</blockquote>So first of all, a minor point: "Congress" here apparently means the House.<br /><br />Second: polarization -- partisan polarization -- just means that Members vote with their party and against theother party. Gridlock is about failure to pass legislation. Indeed, really more specific; to go back to the traffic analogy, it's about failure to pass legislation that everyone wants, but is being blocked by collective action failure of some type.<br /><br />Which is to say that gridlock and polarization are not the same thing, and not necessarily related in any straightforward way.<br /><br />Indeed, within the House, partisan polarization should ease gridlock. Since the House runs by majority party, if that party is unified, then they can basically do whatever they want.<br /><br />Thus in the historic 111th Congress, in 2009-2010, the House was extremely productive. Very strong polarization, and no gridlock at all.<br /><br />The Senate, with the filibuster forcing supermajorities, is another story; there, polarization might make gridlock more likely assuming that the majority party has fewer than 60 Senators. However, with 60 Senators, and given unified government, polarization should mean less, not more, gridock.<br /><br />What about with divided government? Does polarization then mean gridlock?<br /><br />Not necessarily. A non-polarized Congress can avoid gridlock by having different majorities express themselves on different issues. On the other hand, a non-polarized Congress also can create a lot more gridlock. After all, a polarized Congress means that one person can bargain for her whole party; a non-polarized Congress can devolve into an ungovernable mess (indeed, one theory of why parties exist at all is that legislatures don't really work well without them).<br /><br />In other words, the relationship between polarization and gridlock is complicated.<br /><br />What does cause gridlock, however, is a party driven by aversion to compromise -- both internally and with the other party. That's what's happening now, with the dysfunctional GOP. And that, not polarization, is most likely the primary source of current gridlock.<----->Conservatives
What Are Republicans Thinking on Filibusters?<----->At this point in the current filibuster showdown, most of the focus is on <a href="http://blogs.rollcall.com/wgdb/democrats-nuclear-option-judges/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">what the Democrats will do</a>, with Republicans blockading three seats on the DC Circuit Court. It seems to me that Democrats will have little choice but to threaten majority-imposed rules change and, if necessary, carry out that threat. But what are Republicans thinking? I have no idea, but there seem to be several possibilities.<br /><br />1. They don't believe Democrats will really go through with majority-imposed reform.<br /><br />2. They're bluffing. They intend to fold at the last minute, just as they did over executive branch nominations during the last confrontation.<br /><br />3. They're not bluffing, and they don't think the Democrats are bluffing -- they want to get rid of the filibuster, and want the Democrats to be the ones who do it.<br /><br />4. Collectively, they want to back down. However, the <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/07/how-senate-deal-is-working.html">tag-team method</a> they've been using to lose on cloture votes by relatively narrow margins have broken down; they can't find five Republicans to take the potential re-nomination hit of voting for cloture.<br /><br />Or perhaps it's a mistake to suggest that "the Republicans" are thinking anything as a group. After all, these are 45 individual, autonomous politicians; there may be all sorts of mixed combinations of what's going on here. For example, it could be that 20 or so Republican Senators are in column #3 and want to get rid of the filibuster, and then another 20 or so are just afraid to vote against those first twenty...and then a few more are really just bluffing. Or are really reading the Democrats as bluffing.<br /><br />As I said: I have no idea what's going on here, and therefore what the likely end game might be. Perhaps we'll learn more as we move towards the third cloture vote. I have to say: I'm not predicting anything, but I'm not as optimistic as I was last time that they're going to strike a deal.<----->Conservatives
Read Stuff, You Should24<----->Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0175814/">Frances Conroy</a>, 60. <br /><br />Ah, a little good stuff:<br /><br />1. Sarah Binder <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2013/11/12/what-senate-cloture-votes-tell-us-about-obstruction/">on counting filibusters and "blocking."</a> <br /><br />2. Great post by Stan Collender on <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/stan-collender/2788/why-most-important-budget-event-year-has-had-no-impact">why no one paid attention to the new budget deficit numbers</a> -- it's a great example of agenda setting, or in this case negative agenda setting. The one thing worth adding, from the White House point of view: a rapidly decreasing deficit is "objectively" lower; whether it's an improvement is more complicated, though. Best, as Collender says, to just duck the whole issue.<br /><br />3. Ta-Nehisi Coates <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/11/richard-cohen-in-context/281426/">vs. Richard Cohen</a> is hardly a fair fight: the best blogger out there against perhaps the worst columnist? <br /><br />4.

Why I Expect Nothing Out of Bauer-Ginsberg<----->Sparked by my dismissal of the president's electoral administration commission yesterday, Rick Hasen got an update about <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/?p=56681&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+electionlawblog%2FuqCP+%28Election+Law%29">what the Bauer-Ginsberg Commission is up to</a>. Short answer: holding hearings, doing research, planning on a January report.<br /><br />Which is all fine, and I have nothing against Bob Bauer and Ben Ginsberg.<br /><br />But I'll stick to <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/02/a-disappointing-voting-initiative.html">what I said</a> back in February: a presidential commission is the wrong way of going about this, and Bauer and Ginsberg are the wrong people to head it if the goal is to really change things.<br /><br />In particular: presidential commissions are excellent for one kind of situation: when everyone agrees on what should be done, but no one wants the credit (or blame). That's why I want a presidential commission dedicated to slashing vetting for executive branch nominations; presidents don't want to admit that the costs of allowing a few bad apples through are much lower than the costs associated with the current system, nor do they want to have their own reforms blamed when the inevitable bad apples show up. On top of that, presidents aren't likely to want to admit that there's nothing wrong with having some nominees who might, looked at in just the right angle, present an appearance of a conflict of interest.<br /><br />If Obama had presented a serious proposal back in February...well, it probably would have died, but perhaps it could have passed the Senate, and there's always a chance it could have been tossed in to whatever omnibus bill was going through. And I suppose it's still possible that the commission will produce something worthwhile and that Obama will push it hard.<br /><br />But a much more likely outcome is that we get a lowest common denominator report from the commission, avoiding anything that either party objects to, and after the story appears on page A17 that's the end of it until the same problems show up in 2014 and 2016.<----->Obama
Catch of the Day5<-----><div class="tr_bq"><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/11/12/the-morning-plum-white-house-braces-for-terrible-obamacare-enrollment-numbers/">Greg Sargent</a>&nbsp;(his emphasis)</div><blockquote>Lets face it, the spin war over initial low enrollment figures just doesnt matter that much. Because the story here is the same as it always was: <i>All that matters is whether the policy works in the long run.</i><br /><br />If it does, then all of the spin of the moment  <i>low enrollment proves the law is in total collapse! Red state Dems are fleeing the wreckage wholesale</i>!  will be forgotten entirely, and Republicans will have to readjust to a political landscape in which the law is working for lots and lots of people. If it doesnt  if the website doesnt work in the new year, or if enrollment figures remain too low over time, causing the exchanges to collapse  then all bets will be off anyway.</blockquote>Yes, and yes. And he's also correct that the best play for the administration is to be as open about the statistics involved as possible.<br /><br />I'm mostly still sticking with what I said a while ago, which is that ultimately the web site problems won't destroy the program. They certainly could cause a lot of disruption, though; Brian Beutler <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/11/12/gop_about_to_hurt_itself_again_new_ploy_to_kill_obamacare_will_blow_up/">points out</a> that if it really is impossible to enroll at the same time that current plans are discontinued, then that's an enormous problem mostly separate from all the hype about "keep your plan," and it's a problem with no real obvious solution. Other than, you know, to get the damn program working.<br /><br />And, yes, as Sarah Kliff <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/11/12/its-not-quite-time-to-freak-out-over-obamacares-enrollment-number/">says today</a>, what's important is who signs up as much as it is how many.<br /><br />But regardless: the law is here, it's being implemented, half a million people have signed up for Medicaid, young adults are on their parents' plans, the donut hole is disappearing and other Medicare benefits have begun, lifetime and yearly caps and rescissions are gone...all of that is going to be very, very, difficult to displace. So when Greg says -- and I agree -- what matters is whether ACA works or not, what it matters to is the next wave of reform and change. Repeal? No, we're never going back to the status quo ante. <br /><br />Spin over first-month signups, meanwhile, won't affect any of that.<br /><br />Nice catch!<----->Obama
Plain Blogger Smackdown<-----><div class="tr_bq">Over at Greg's place yesterday, I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/11/11/u-s-elections-are-still-awful-we-should-fix-that/">used</a> the hook of Virginia's wild count in the AG election as an excuse to call for more attention to election administration.&nbsp;</div><br />Reid Wilson <a href="https://twitter.com/PostReid/status/400014048752062464">liked it</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Good point from @jbplainblog: States really aren't that good at administering elections</blockquote>And then a backlash started.<br /><br /><a href="https://twitter.com/ElectProject/status/400017184107151360">Michael McDonald</a>:<br /><blockquote>usually don't see errors from election night reporting &gt;&gt; cavass. Virginia very transparent<br /><br />unfair to VA election officials to use that transparency against them</blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/HHHElections/status/400016495281188864">HHH Election Program</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">With all due respect, it's a silly argument; states are just using the canvass to make sure count is right</blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/TheBradBlog/status/400018911678443520">Brad Friedman</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Totally unfair. VA, so far, doing an EXCELLENT job of public canvass. (Voting machines a diff issue.)</blockquote>I'll take the blame here. I didn't really intend to imply that the small changes in the canvass are evidence of Virginia doing anything wrong, but I'm responsible for it coming out that way.<br /><br />More to the point: I'm responsible for using the messiness that's inevitable whenever anyone looks closely at an election as a hook for arguing for better election administration in general. It's a fair point that any election, no matter how well run, is going to look messy when it's basically tied after 2.2M votes.<br /><br />That said: my intention wasn't to bash the people doing the work in Virginia, but an overall system of election administration that is neglected, underfunded, and overly partisan. Which it is.<br /><br />And so I think the intended argument of the post was just fine. But, you know, see above.<----->General
