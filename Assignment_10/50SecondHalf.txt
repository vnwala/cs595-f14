In Defense of Partisan Hack Pundits<----->Jonathan Chait <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/12/today-in-hackery.html">argued something yesterday</a> that I think is wrong:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">[L]et me reveal a couple professional secrets here. Intellectual consistency is a basic value for political commentators. You want to be sure your strongly held views are the product of an actual philosophy, because the temptation to see events through the prism of partisan bias is strong.</blockquote>He says this to put the hurt on Charles Krauthammer's flip on the filibuster and the nuclear option between the Bush-era Senate showdown and the recent Obama-era version. <br /><br />Intellectual consistency is a basic value, perhaps, for some political commentators. But I'm not sure it's necessary for all political commentators.<br /><br />Put it this way. I might read Chait because I care what Jonathan Chait thinks about things. In fact, I do; he's a smart guy, and a fun writer.<br /><br />But one also might seek out political commentators in order to hear the best, good-faith arguments for and against something that's in the news. For that, I want someone who reliably supports one side of the partisan divide (or perhaps one ideological strain). I still don't want phony arguments; that's why I didn't title this "In Defense of Krauthammer," because I generally don't think he supplies strong, honest arguments. There's still a requirement for serious intellectual integrity, even for partisan arguments.<br /><br />I think Chait is talking about something like a "public intellectual" model, and what I'd say is that there's also room for a lawyer model. For a lawyer-model pundit, it doesn't matter so much if she said the exact opposite thing five years ago, but it still matters a lot if she gets her facts right and makes well-reasoned, well-informed, arguments.<br /><br />I guess the question is whether there's really any need for lawyer-style commentators, given that it's the professional responsibility of many politicians to essentially do that. I'd say: sure. Commentators, as opposed to politicians or their staff, are relatively free to make the argument properly, without having to worry about the political fallout from the various speed traps and potholes that politicians have to shy away from -- or from winning daily spin wars.<br /><br />Granted, it's unlikely that anyone is going to identify himself as a lawyer-style commentator. And yes, one tip-off that Krauthammer isn't worth bothering with is his extreme certainty that he's correct, even as (as Chait notes) he flips from one side to another of an issue based on partisan tides. But overall, there's probably a lot more room for good lawyer-style pundits than Chait thinks.<----->General
Catch of the Day3<----->To Scott Lemieux for (once again) <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/12/post-political-critiques-of-post-political-politics">shooting down liberal fantasies</a> that the only thing preventing Congress from passing single-payer health care insurance in 2009-2010 was a failure of will from the president.<br /><br />It's an excellent job, and sadly necessary, over and over again.<br /><br />One key point that Lemieux doesn't mention this time: in one sense, this really isn't about 2009 at all. It's about 2007 and 2008, when the three leading Democratic presidential candidates converged on essentially the same plan (with Obama famously omitting the individual mandate). That says a lot. It says that none of those three candidates believed that adopting single-payer would have given them a serious edge in a closely contested nomination fight -- and that no other candidate was able to leap to the top tier by embracing single-payer. In other words, it tells us that in the world of 2007-2008, at least, the ACA was mainstream within the actual Democratic Party as it was, and single-payer was a fringe position in the actual Democratic Party as it was. Maybe lots and lots of Democrats preferred single-payer in some sense, but virtually none of them, either elites or electorates, did anything about it. And that's what counts.<br /><br />What this also means is that ACA vs. single-payer had <i>virtually nothing to do with Barack Obama himself</i>. And so Obama-centric explanations for it are clearly, 100%, wrong.<br /><br />I'd further argue, although here it's not quite as clear, that there was very little about the way that Obama fought for the ACA that had much to do with Obama himself. Yes, a Hillary Clinton WH would have looked a little different from the Obama WH...but not all that very different. Yes, presidents themselves do make key decisions, and not their staff or their party. But not only are they often severely constrained by their party (and by Congress, and by lots of other things), but they're also highly influenced by the incentives of the job, and those are the same whether we're talking Obama, Clinton, or George W. Bush.<br /><br />In short, there's an excellent chance that both the good and bad outcomes on health care reform would have wound up more or less the same whether the winner of the 2008 Democratic nomination was Obama, or Hillary, or a hypothetically unscandaled John Edwards, or for that matter John Kerry or Al Gore.<br /><br />Meanwhile: nice catch!<----->General
Read Stuff, You Should12<----->Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/berryda01.shtml">Damon Berryhill</a>, 50. I mentioned Jamie Moyer recently. Moyer is a big deal for my larger cohort; Berryhill was a big deal, for roughly the same reasons, for me personally. Hey, you could do worse. I mean, if you have to pick a player who you want to have a long, long, long, career, you could do worse than a professional backup catcher who switch-hits. Alas, despite a very respectable 1997 season, he didn't get another shot.<br /><br />Good stuff:<br /><br />1.

Myths, Myths, Myths<----->I did an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/12/02/if-theres-a-white-house-problem-its-substance-not-spin/">item</a> today about today's calls for Obama to start firing people willy-nilly that was probably not nearly harsh enough. But the one thing I left out that I really want to get to is yet another myth about a previous president.<br /><br />No, not the one about second-term presidents never recovering if their approval sinks; I saw that again today, but I've already handled that one.<br /><br />It's <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/191683-dems-admit-reboot-needs-stronger-team">this one</a> (my emphasis):<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">I dont know where the breakdown occurred on that, but its Obamas no new taxes moment, the official said, referring to <i>the broken promise that is widely seen as having cost President George H.W. Bush a second term.</i></blockquote>Hogwash! What cost George H.W. Bush a second term was a poorly timed recession. That's all.<br /><br />Bush breaking his tax pledge was a story in June through October 1990. Look at his <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/124922/Presidential-Approval-Center.aspx">approval ratings</a>: it's hard to make much of it. In particular, this all happened before the Gulf War, which relegated it to ancient history. One can argue that it hurt Bush in the long run by destroying trust in him, but that certainly didn't seem to have any effect at all in spring 1991. Only when the economy turned south did his approval ratings follow.<br /><br />I suspect that for the neutral press, this is a close relative of the <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/04/04/third_party_myth_easterbrook/">equally untrue myth that Ross Perot cost Bush the election</a>. Why? Because after three consecutive solid Republican victories, by 1992 most Republicans believed the myth of a GOP "electoral lock" and therefore were open to bogus explanations of something which actually didn't need much explanation at all beyond the obvious one that incumbent presidents usually lose re-election if there's a recession in the second half of their term. What distinguishes this one, I'm sure, is that a faction of the Republican Party is intensely interested in convincing everyone that higher taxes ruined Bush's presidency, while pretty much no one else cares.<br /><br />At any rate, at best breaking the pledge was a very minor factor in the 1992 election, and most likely it had no effect at all. Moreover, to the extent that it hurt at all, it may well have been because of how central, high-profile, and specific the pledge was in Bush's 1988 campaign. I'd guess it's easily in the top 1% of all campaign pledges ever if all those factors are combined, and pretty high up there as far as how high-profile and absolute the breaking of it was. Really, however, it likely made no difference at all in 1992.<----->Obama
Hey, Pollsters!<----->Three topics I'd love to know more about:<br /><br />1. How many people know that Healthcare.gov is Obamacare? Especially the people who actually use it. Also, the associated questions: how many know that it's the Affordable Care Act, and how many know that there's more to the ACA than the exchanges? I'm assuming that the number of people who associate Healthcare.gov with Obamacare is higher than it would have been if it had worked smoothly from the start...I'd expect the number to be relatively high now, and start to shrink as time goes on. But either way, I'd love to know about it.<br /><br />2. How many people know that the US is still involved in a shooting war in Afghanistan? How many know that the US is no longer involved in a shooting war in Iraq? I saw another reference today somewhere to "two wars"...I suppose that might have meant Afghanistan and the general "war on terror," or it could have been just a error while writing quickly, or that there was an implicit "over the last decade" that I didn't read properly, but really I have no idea. I'm fairly certain that some people think the US is still occupying Iraq, and that some people don't know there are still US troops (and US casualties) in Afghanistan, but whether it's a tiny fraction or something more substantial? I have no idea.<br /><br />3. An old standby: What do people mean when they talk about the "deficit"? Or, to put it another way: what do people hear when pollsters ask them about the deficit?<br /><br />Generally: I find myself curious about political knowledge (in the electorate, but sometimes among elites) at least as often as I am curious about political opinions. That might just be because there's plenty of available information about opinions and much less about knowledge; I can't tell.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/18/wasteful-spending-poll_n_2886081.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000008">This worked once!</a> So: Hey, pollsters: I bet I'm not the only one curious about these things.<br /><br /><br /><----->Obama
Repeal is Still Dead<----->A few bullet points on health care reform at the start of December...<br /><br />*The brutal truth of "repeal" is that whatever the politics, every day a flat-out repeal of the ACA becomes more and more nonsensical. The status quo ante no longer exists; changing the law back to how it was in 2009 wouldn't bring back the health care situation that existed then.<br /><br />*Hey, health care wonks! I've been using this line about how <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/11/01/the-gop-push-for-obamacare-repeal-is-dead/">repeal no longer makes policy sense</a> for some time now, but while I'm confident that's correct, I'm certainly not enough of a health care wonk to write up all the details that make a return (via repeal) to 2009 just plain gibberish -- what I called the Humpty-Dumptyness of the situation. Someone want to take a crack at it?<br /><br />*It's also true, as Brian Beutler <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/12/02/r_i_p_obamacare_repeal_movement_crusade_is_officially_dead/">says today</a> (and Kevin Drum <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/11/obamacare-done-deal">said last week</a>) that in simple political terms flat-out repeal is less and less plausible every day, with more and more people having insurance through the exchanges.<br /><br />*All of which is to say that the US health care system has now been (almost) fully Obamacare-ized, and future changes will build on the ACA. That might even had been true after a GOP landslide in 2012, but it's certainly true now.<br /><br />*Which in turn means that radicals who insist that Republicans who deviate at all from the hard-line repeal message are asking those Republicans to (continue to) absent themselves from the real debate over what's next.<br /><br />*Of course, that would be less true if there really was a Republican alternative to the ACA -- if "repeal and replace" had ever become a true alternative. But even so, any alternative to Obamacare will, at this point, have to build on Obamacare.<br /><br />*It also means that all-or-nothing assessments of the ACA (or of Healthcare.gov) are not only inaccurate, but particularly unhelpful because nothing is really at stake in whether the law "succeeds" or "fails." What matters is what current, Obamacare-ized health care does well, does not so well, and does badly, and what new laws/regulations/practices can help where improvements are needed.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />(Yes, I did try to come up with an appropriate Humpty Dance title for this one, but alas I couldn't make it work. Partially because I don't mean to imply that post-ACA health care is broken; what I mean, as I hope is clear, is that the status quo ante can't be put back together again. But mostly because I couldn't find the right quote...I could, however, have opened with "Stop whatcha doin' 'cause I'm about to ruin the image and the style that ya used to.")<----->Obama

The hardest thing about getting Holmes right has to be the precise gradation of just how smart he is. Too smart and there's no drama (or else you need to keep coming up with cheats, and what's the point of that?). Not smart enough, and why are we watching?

John Sides is correct that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2013/12/01/hillary-clinton-does-not-need-to-rebuild-her-standing-among-black-voters/">analysis of nomination politics should distinguish between elite and mass opinion</a>. The important thing to note is that at this point (and throughout the invisible primary, at least), it's elite opinion that matters. If a politician is popular among the rank-and-file of some group but unpopular among opinion leaders for that group, the odds are strong that by Iowa, he or she will be unpopular among that group's voters.<br /><br />3.

And Philip Klein <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/no-obamacare-isnt-fixed/article/2539974">with a critique</a>. Overall, I think his criticisms of the consumer experience are not unreasonable, but probably mostly irrelevant; most state DMVs had terrible service, but very few people decided to pass on getting a license because of it. On the other hand, the back-end problems...that's the critical question, and I agree with him (and Kliff) that we just have very little idea of what's going on -- and there's a scary possibility that no one will know what's going on until more people get through the system (which should happen in the next few weeks).<br /><br />6.

My Glitch is Fixed!<----->I tweeted about this last night, but why not make a post out of it: I've been stuck at the same place at Healthcare.gov since mid or late October, and now they've fixed my glitch! I tried last night for the first time in a week, and suddenly the program didn't hang at the spot it's been hanging. Exciting!<br /><br />For what it's worth: the problem was in the initial family information, towards the end. It asked about whether my eldest was a full-time student (she is), and then whether she had a parent in the same state in which she attends school (she doesn't), and then it couldn't save and continue after I answered it. Now? It can. I was able to complete the family information. Next step is income, and I wasn't prepared for it last night, so I bailed; I'll try to continue sometime soon.<br /><br />Realistic interpretation: It's silly to try to extrapolate from one customer's experience to anything at all about the system. The odds that I'll finish the process and actually have exchange-purchased health insurance are definitely much higher now, but what that says about anything else is probably a stretch.<br /><br />Pessimistic interpretation: this is one small glitch which probably applied to a handful of people, and isn't really related to the big-deal back-end problems (correctly calculating subsidies, communicating accurately with health insurance companies) which could cause massive and serious problems.<br /><br />Optimistic interpretation: if they got around to fixing my glitch, which probably applies to a tiny handful of people, then there's a good chance they're doing an even better job of dealing with the big-deal back-end problems which could cause massive and serious problems.<br /><br />The correct one is...the realistic interpretation, of course. There's really no way to know what it means that one customer was able to get through one glitch.<br /><br />Now, they're definitely improving it: logging in has been easy for weeks now after being on-and-off for a while, for example. On the other hand, they claim that response time is better; maybe it is, but the "save and continue" function is still very slow (and the system is designed to force a "save and continue" frequently, so putting in all family information for a four-person family takes quite some time). And I've only just now completed the first step, so I have no idea how the next parts will go.<br /><br />Still, my glitch is fixed!<----->Obama
What Mattered This Week6?<----->Not much up on a Thanksgiving week. Plus with travel and all I'm sure I missed plenty. I'm sort of tempted to go with "blue slip" obstruction breaking through into national news, but I'm not sure yet whether it matters or not....I'll be dull and just repeat one of my <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/11/29/whats-at-stake-in-the-next-aca-deadline/">items</a> from yesterday about the ACA end-of-month deadline: fixes (or failures) certainly matter to the individuals affected, but I still don't think the future of the program is at stake, or that how close healthcare.gov is to fully functional in the next week (or even month) will have much effect on the 2014 or 2016 elections.<br /><br />That's what I have.

One More Time on Subsamples (Ignore Those Polls! Addendum)<----->Last week I <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/ignore-those-polls-small-sample-size.html">took someone to task</a> for placing too much weight on Gallup's reports of Latino voters supposedly disproportionate turn away from Barack Obama. One week more, and...it's disappearing even more. In the Gallup weekly reports, Obama trickled down to 40% approval overall after three weeks at 41%, but his approval among Hispanic citizens is up for the third week in a row and now stands at 54%, 14 points higher than his overall rating. That's consistent with where he was back in September (that is, it's down, but not down more than the overall dip).<br /><div><br /></div><div>It's certainly possible that there's something going on here, but it's also possible, and perhaps a bit more likely, that the earlier dip never actually happened. It was just a bit of random variation.</div><div><br /></div><div>I wanted to post on this not to beat up on the same thing, but because there's one additional point I didn't mention which is actually pretty important. Gallup publishes, in their weekly reports, a colossal 41 different splits. Look: flip a single coin 1000 times, and if heads comes up 600 times, something is probably going on. But what you're doing here is walking into a coin flipping factory, with some flipped 1000 times, and some 100 times, and some only 10 times, and yeah, if all you are doing are looking for oddball results then you're going to find what you're looking for.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>And so, like clockwork, we have another reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/NKingofDC/status/405105717767454721">tweeting out</a> that "Obama's approval has dropped the sharpest among Eastern wealthy post-grads."

Why We Get Majorities Wrong<----->Matt Glassman <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/majorities.html">comments</a>&nbsp;on my earlier post on majorities:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">I totally understand why people are so keen to get rid of the filibuster. I cannot for the life of me understand why --- given the shining example of majority-rule just a football field south of the Senate --- they do not understand that there are both positive and negative consequences to doing so.</blockquote>I think I know the answer to this one, although I'll admit it's speculative. And the answer is...political culture. Or, if you prefer, poor education.<br /><br />Basically, there's incredibly widespread belief about two things in the US, one which confuses us and one which is just plain false:<br /><br />1. Democracy is the best system of government (sometimes, but not always, with the Churchill qualifier; sometimes, especially these days among conservatives, with an essentially nonsense distinction between "republic" and "democracy"); and,<br /><br />2. &nbsp;In democracies, decisions are made by majority vote.<br /><br />That the first of these is virtually uncontested winds up with everyone believing that whatever reforms they support make things more democratic. This matters because it gets in the way of clear thinking about what democracy actually is, since it becomes whatever it is we think best. It is, however, not actually true. Some of us have other things we care about; for example, we might care more about policy outcomes than the system of government that achieves them. It's OK that we're not all committed to democracy above all else; it would help us talk about this stuff if we were willing to accept that (and, in turn, accept that democracy isn't <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0533453/trivia?tab=qt&amp;ref_=tt_trv_qu">all</a> "[t]he good guys are always stalwart and true. The bad guys are easily distinguished by their pointy horns or black hats, and, uh, we always defeat them and save the day").<br /><br />The second one is just plain wrong. At best, a pure, strict, majoritarian democracy is one of the many varieties of democracy, and not one that many democratic theorists (or, for that matter, democratic polities) actually subscribe to. But there are plenty of other forms of democracy. As always, I turn to Hannah Arendt on the difference between majority decision and majority rule:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">...we commonly equate and confound majority rule with majority decision. &nbsp;The latter, however, is a technical device...In America, at any rate [the Constitution was] framed with the express and conscious intention to prevent, as far as humanly possible, the procedures of majority decisions from generating into the "elective despotism" of majority rule (On Revolution, 164-165, or at least it was in the old editions).</blockquote>We adopt the "technical device" of majority voting often -- not always -- because it works well enough in many instances. That's just fine. But thinking that the goal is majority rule, and that the job of democratic design is to find procedures to empower one particular majority as much as possible, is totally backwards.<br /><br />None of which is to say whether majority voting is appropriate in any particular situation, or to ignore that the Constitution has plenty of anti-majoritiarian mechanisms which certainly matter in the question of what Senate procedures are more or less democratic. It's just that I think basic democratic (mis)education in the US far too often equates democracy with majority rule, and leaves people believing that these questions are obvious and easy.*<br /><br />The truth? Democracy doesn't always produce the substantive outcomes we want. And: democracy is more complex than just taking a vote and whoever gets the most votes, wins. That your grade school teachers (and, I'm afraid, many of your college professors) didn't explain that to you is too bad, but it is nevertheless the truth.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />*OK, I spent way to much time trying to work "lie to me" into that paragraph, and I'll just settle for this footnote...basically, we watched that episode again last night, and as usual it's with me all day today. My apologies.<----->General
Majorities<----->Ezra Klein <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/11/22/wonkbook-harry-reids-bid-to-save-the-senate/">writes</a>&nbsp;last week (my emphasis):<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">So the question here isn't so much about the change in power now as it is in the change in power over time. That change doesn't clearly favor Democrats or Republicans. Rather, <i>it favors majorities over minorities</i>. And a corrective on that front has been overdue for decades. The only thing worse than a Senate where the majority has the power to govern is one where it doesn't.</blockquote>I'm going to keep banging this one in, because it's terribly important. Removing the filibuster doesn't favor "majorities." It favors one particular majority. Not a policy majority. The party majority.<br /><br />Remember, nominations that the majority party in the Senate opposes won't necessarily make it to the Senate floor in the first place, even if they would actually win if they came to a vote. Indeed, one can imagine a House-like Senate refusing to bring nominees up for a vote unless a majority of the majority party favors it.<br /><br />"Majorities"? There's a majority right now for ENDA in the House, most observers believe. There's almost certainly a majority for a Senate-like immigration bill. I suppose it's even possible that there's a majority in the House for some very mild gun legislation. But in a body in which the majority party runs things, those other majorities aren't getting votes.<br /><br />The thing is that there are multiple majorities on multiple issues at any one time in any legislative chamber. What parties do is structure things so that certain majorities are allowed to express themselves -- and others are suppressed (meaning that in those cases, the minority wins). That's fine; in fact, it's better than fine, since legislatures probably couldn't function very well without that kind of structure. But there's no reason to assume that the party majority is the only majority that matters, or that it's always inherently better (and more democratic) to allow the party to determine which majorities count.<br /><br />And that's without getting into the more complex question of whether majorities should always win in a democracy. I'm strongly convinced they shouldn't (a classic example is when an indifferent majority is opposed by an intense minority). But put that aside. Again: reforms which favor party leadership simply do not favor chamber majorities in all cases, at any rate. They favor the majority party.<br /><br />Strict majority party rule is, to be sure, better than strict minority party rule. Or, even worse, the incredibly bizarre situation in which a minority of the minority party intimidates the bulk of that party into doing whatever they say, and then abuses chamber rules to dictate to the majority party some policy which in fact only a slim majority support. So, yes, given the situation, Harry Reid and the Democrats had no choice but to act, and the result is in fact better than what they were faced with. To say that it necessarily empowers majorities, however, is another question altogether.<----->Liberals
Read Stuff, You Should16<----->Happy Birthday to <span id="goog_1970391799"></span><a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Tim Armstrong<span id="goog_1970391800"></span></a>, 47. <br /><br />Plenty of good stuff for a holiday week:<br /><br />1. Four pieces -- Greg Koger, Barbara Sinclair, Aaron Belkin, and Richard Arenberg -- on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/11/22/a-change-in-rules-on-filibusters-and-its-impact-on-congress?hp&amp;rref=opinion">the post-nuclear Senate.</a><br /><br />2. <a href="http://isps.yale.edu/news/blog/2013/11/the-senate-and-the-nuclear-option#.UpGRlsSsiSq">Another one</a>, from David Mayhew. <br /><br />3. And <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2013/11/24/fate-of-the-filibuster-in-a-post-nuclear-senate/">another</a> from Sarah Binder. I suppose she's right that the Senate will never quite "become the House" -- something I'm guilty of saying. However, I do think the risk (or, if you like it, the promise) of it coming close enough is sufficient that it's only a misdemeanor, not a felony, to use it as a shorthand. <br /><br />4. Mark Goldberg on <a href="http://www.undispatch.com/3-reasons-why-this-iran-breakthrough-is-a-very-big-deal">the Iran deal</a>.<br /><br />5. Fred Kaplan on <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/war_stories/2013/11/_iran_nukes_this_is_exactly_the_deal_that_obama_hoped_to_achieve_in_geneva.html">the Iran deal</a>. <br /><br />6. <a href="http://sites.middlebury.edu/presidentialpower/2013/11/22/why-the-kennedy-legacy-endures/">Why is JFK so popular?</a> I don't disagree with the three numbered reasons Matthew Dickinson gives us, but as I've said before I suspect the unnumbered one following those -- the active efforts by the Kennedy family and allies to produce that popularity -- is really the key (as it is with Reagan).<br /><br />7. Kevin Drum makes the key point that <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/11/obamacare-has-friend-health-care-industry">the entire health care industry, basically, is already committed to ACA</a> (because they had to be), which means that it ain't gonna disappear. Which matches the point that I've been making: repeal of ACA is long dead because the status quo ante no longer exists; whatever happens will be building on ACA, not starting over.<----->General
Sunday Question for Liberals4<----->Same question, pushing &nbsp;on my Saturday Salon <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/11/23/why_we_should_save_the_filibuster/">column</a>, in which I argued that the filibuster can still be saved. I say if Republicans offered a deal which would preserve some possibility of blocking judicial nominations, but gave up at least some of the filibuster on legislation, Democrats should go for it. If Republicans did suggest such a deal, should Democrats accept it?<----->Liberals
Sunday Question for Conservatives5<----->I'm going to push on my Saturday Salon <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/11/23/why_we_should_save_the_filibuster/">column</a>, in which I argued that the filibuster can still be saved. I say Republicans could still get a deal which would preserve some possibility of blocking judicial nominations, but give up at least some of the filibuster on legislation. If such a deal is possible, should they go for it?<----->Conservatives
What Mattered This Week7?<----->Not the only thing that mattered, but I'll go with the obvious one: the Senate going nuclear is a very big deal.<br /><br />What didn't matter? I'll stick with filibusters, and agree with Adam Ramey that if the legislative filibuster goes, it's <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2013/11/23/why-eliminating-the-filibuster-altogether-would-matter-less-than-you-think/">not going to matter much</a>...as long as there's divided government. Although even then, "less than you think" could still be a big deal, so I suppose this isn't a very good "didn't matter." Sorry; I've been so focused on the nuclear business that I hardly know what else happened this week, and all the things I can think of actually did matter.<br /><br />But maybe you have more. What do you think mattered this week?<----->General
Friday Baseball Post3<----->I sort of think I must be overreacting to this one, but I'm just very pleased with the <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/hudsoti01.shtml">Tim Hudson</a> signing. The 38 and 39 year old seasons of a fringe-HOF type pitcher who has aged pretty well? Yeah, I'll take that. Sure, he could easily go south, but the odds of 50-55 league-average starts over the two years seem reasonable high to me. There were a couple of guys out there I was worried fit the Sabean profile who I was a lot less confident in, so I'm smiling about this. Given that I'm also a Freak optimist at this point, I'm happy with Sabean. Of course, he hasn't dealt with the 1B/LF hole yet.<br /><br />Hudson has really had bad luck with money over his career. I mean, for a player at his level, over the same years; obviously, if you're a HOF-level pitcher, you're going to be lucky financially if you debut in 1999 and not 1979 or 1959. Still, he's just shy of $100M total salaries going into the $25M over the next two years he'll get from the Giants. Doesn't that seem below par for a guy with his career? His #1 most-similar at baseball-reference is Kevin Brown (debut 1989), and he's running just about even with Brown's salary take through their 39 year old seasons (assuming we can count on Hudson pulling in the money on the contract he just signed). He's behind Andy Pettitte, too, and behind Mike Mussina. Age here means a lot, but Hudson hasn't benefited from it. I mean, Roy Oswalt has made $97M so far, and he's younger than Hudson and not even remotely as good. Mark Buehrle, too. And then there's Hudson's old A's teammate, but we don't want to talk about him, do we?<br /><br />At far as his chances of getting to the real HOF, it seems pretty unlikely; his HOF Monitor number is a very unimpressive 59. His chances (assuming no sabermetric revolution) basically depend on a revival that get him at least to 250 wins from his current 205 (plausible!). 300 doesn't appear possible; he would probably have to stay a rotation starter until he's 45 or 46, and he sure doesn't appear to have the stuff to do that. If he does get to 250, though, and maybe tacks on some impressive postseason stuff...well, then he's going to have a lot of sabermetric support, and he'll be a bubble guy.<br /><br />I think he'll be fun to root for.<----->Sports
Post-Nuclear Etc.<----->Just a few notes to add to what I said elsewhere, including <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/11/21/did-frustrated-mainstream-republicans-help-pull-the-trigger/?clsrd">here</a> for what the GOP was up to and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/11/22/power-the-senate-and-the-republican-control-grab/">here</a> for something about power and control in the Senate.<br /><br />* I think the certainty among many liberals that Republicans would rapidly go nuclear as soon as they had unified control of the Senate and the White House is at best unproven. After all, they didn't do it when they had the opportunity during the George W. Bush years. If Democrats ratcheted down to Bush-level selective filibusters...maybe yes, maybe no. It may be true that the next GOP Senate would be more radical-influenced than the last ones, but then again they would still need the votes; if they only have 51 or 52, it's not very likely.<br /><br />* Conservatives who think that Bush-era filibusters were on a par with Obama-era filibusters...just stop it. It's not a serious argument. Obama has faced a true 60 vote Senate, which means that virtually everything has been filibustered (yes, even those judges who were approved by voice vote with no cloture vote only got there because they had secured 60 votes, and that's a filibuster. Or at least it was). That's new. The blockades-by-filibuster are essentially new, too. It's a little more complicated...there have been blockades before, but they're usually by a Senate majority, or at the end of a president's term, or both. Nothing like this one. The escalation is more severe on the exec branch nomination side, but it's still very large on the judicial side.<br /><br />* And that's without even getting into <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/obama-filibuster-liberal-judges">the blue-slip situation</a>.<br /><br />* Just to be clear: yes, Democrats definitely ratcheted up judicial nomination filibusters during the George W. Bush presidency. Democrats also bear responsibility for ratcheting up opposition to executive branch nominations, with the Tower nomination a major turning point. Democrats, however, were willing to cut a deal to back down from the edge.<br /><br />* Some liberals are urging Obama to now appoint very liberal judges. If he does that, it will risk defeat the old-fashioned way, by building a coalition of all Republicans and a handful of moderate Democrats. So far, Obama has stuck to mainstream judges, and that's meant he's retained just about every Senate Democrat on almost every confirmation vote (I don't actually remember any defections, but I assume there have been a few over the years). That's not to say Obama shouldn't do it. Just that there are costs and benefits that are not always easy to calculate.<br /><br />OK, that's all for now, but I suspect I'll have more points later.<----->Conservatives
Read Stuff, You Should17<----->Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000416/">Terry Gilliam</a>, 73. One of those days with lots of good choices, but I'll go with the Python.<br /><br />1. Greg Koger <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2013/11/21/reids-tactical-nuke-and-the-future-of-the-senate/">on the post-nuclear Senate.</a><br /><br />2. Paul Krugman is right <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/news-cycle-delusions/?smid=tw-NytimesKrugman&amp;seid=auto">on Republicans, news cycles, and the ACA</a>.<br /><br />3. And Jennifer Lind <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2013/11/21/why-not-say-sorry-afghanistan-and-the-politics-of-apologies/">on apologies</a>. Interesting. What I really am looking for, however, is a good analysis of the various players on the US side in the US/Afghanistan negotiations on post-2014, and who wants what and why. My general sense of it is that Barack Obama probably should just want out, and that the (apparent) effort to stay indicates that he's getting rolled by...I don't know. But this is just wild guessing on my part, and I could just as easily imagine that Obama wants to stay, and, say, the Pentagon wants out. At any rate, I haven't seen any analysis at all, and I'd like to.<----->General
Quick Post-Nuclear Fizzle<----->The Senate has gone nuclear. My <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/11/21/the-senate-has-gone-nuclear-heres-whats-next/">first notes</a> are up, over at Plum Line.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll have more on this, but one quick note. Soon after the key vote, Harry Reid asked for, and received, unanimous consent for committees to meet. That's normally a routine request. The fact that it remains a routine request, even immediately after the Democrats acted, is a quick answer to one question: no, Republicans will not "blow up" the Senate to retaliate for majority-imposed reform. I suppose it's possible that they'll regroup and change their minds, but much more likely will be some sort of&nbsp; minor "blow up" demonstration, nothing more. McConnell didn't really even make a lot of threats about it, at least not today.<br /><br />OK, my prediction of a GOP surrender (well, I made odds on it, so not exactly a prediction) didn't work out so well, but this is one that it looks like I <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/05/anticipating-nuclear-fallout.html">was right</a>. <br /><br />I'll also say that I don't really believe that today's action is going to matter at all in terms of bipartisan bargaining in the future. We'll see; a lot of smart observers <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBudgetGuy/status/403598207956946944">think it will</a>, plus I'm hearing Wolf Blitzer just now talking about "poisonous atmosphere." We'll see, but I really don't think that the "atmosphere" stuff is really going to make any difference at all.<----->Liberals
Nuke (Maybe) Day<----->I'm not posting anything right now because...well, because I'm watching the Senate, and there doesn't seem to be anything more to say until we know what's going on. At least, anything worth posting about.<br /><br />I'm tweeting, so head <a href="https://twitter.com/jbplainblog">over there</a> for blow-by-blow type stuff. I'll probably have something up later over at Greg's place, and then odds are that I'll be back here for more when things wrap up.<br /><br />My guess at the beginning of the day was a 60% chance of GOP surrender (with perhaps a "deal" that's really surrender with a fig leaf; 20% chance of a deal that gives Democrats most, but not all, of what they want; 10% chance that Democrats are just bluffing, and 10% chance that Reid actually pushes the button. So far, however, there's very little chatter about, well, anything. So who knows?<br /><br />Anyway, feel free to use this as an open filibuster/judges thread.<----->Liberals

Ed Whelan is correct: <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/364425/abolishing-judicial-filibuster-ed-whelan">excepting Supreme Court nominations from a nuclear-induced ban on other judicial nominations is pretty much a joke</a>. Which is one of the reasons that Democrats didn't act up to now.<br /><br />4. I agree with Matt Yglesias about <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/11/20/doctors_pay_under_obamacare_cut_the_whining.html">the doctors' cartel</a>. I'd like to see a good post, however, comparing doctors and lawyers.<br /><br />5. And Sarah Kliff loves the first chart in her post, which I agree is a big deal. But <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/11/20/this-chart-is-amazing-news-for-our-health-cost-problem/">the last chart is the Wow! one to me</a>.<----->General
Elsewhere/Housekeeping<----->My TAP column this week <a href="http://prospect.org/article/how-republicans-lost-chance-win-obamacare">argues</a> that Republicans could have tried out some of the ideas that conservatives have been pushing if only they had decided to run their own state exchanges. I'm pretty confident that Democrats, either in 2009-2010 or later, would have been willing to cut deals to allow that sort of experimentation on a state level.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Meanwhile, I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/11/19/the-senate-reform-we-should-get/">packed</a> way too much into a short post over at PP yesterday -- including an outline of the filibuster deal I'd like to see (but has no chance of happening, even though the core of it actually makes sense for both parties). Yes, there's a Superbill! appearance.</div><div><br /></div><div>Housekeeping: I'm traveling today; I might sneak in another post, especially if something happens with the filibuster, but probably not. And might as well get this out of the way now...posting is going to be hit or miss from now through Thanksgiving week, since there are a bunch of days next week I'll either be traveling, or trying to have some family vacation time, or filling in for Greg. I'll try to have something here every (non-holiday) weekday, but it's just hard to plan out exactly what or how much. I'm sure I'll be writing about the Senate showdown, though, one way or another. Beyond that, things should be back to normal the first week of December.&nbsp;</div><----->Conservatives

This is about the crucial communications between the exchanges and insurance companies, and it was an even bigger problem in October than the visible problems at Healthcare.gov. On the other hand? They're apparently nowhere close to being ready to pay subsidies to insurance companies. But delaying that will just be costly; the 834s could be a system-destroying disaster.

I (more or less) disagree, but the more practical issue here isn't really about whether filibusters are good for democracy or liberals or conservatives; it's that they're good for individual Senators, and (again, like it or not) they're going to be reluctant to surrender them.<br /><br />5.

Filibuster Showdown Update<----->Greg Sargent is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/11/19/harry-reid-is-set-to-go-nuclear/">reporting</a> that Harry Reid is going to move towards a showdown on judicial filibusters sometime in the next week, perhaps in the next couple of days.<br /><br />He has a leadership aid saying Democrats have "no choice," which is pretty much <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/11/13/its-time-to-go-nuclear-in-the-senate/?hpid=z3">what I've been saying</a> as this thing has been developing.<br /><br />Think of this as a bargaining game, with the goal of (most of the majority) Democrats to get a situation where filibusters are used, rarely, against nominees who are thought by the minority as far out of the mainstream. They don't want an outcome with no filibusters, because they want to preserve their position when they are in the minority; but they also don't want more frequent filibusters.* As Republicans push farther and farther from the Democratic ideal point, total elimination of the filibuster becomes a more and more appealing second-best end point.<br /><br />Blockading three DC Appeals Court seats is, I've thought from the beginning, far beyond that line. Thus "no choice."<br /><br />Remember, we still don't know exactly why the Republicans are where they are. They may want Democrats to eliminate the filibuster; in that case, that's what we'll get. On the other hand, it could merely be a breakdown in the tag-team voting they've used since the summer confrontation to get cloture on nominations, with different sets of at least five (previously six) Republicans voting yes. If that's the case, then it may just mean that the dozen or so tag teamers will get together and figure out who has to cast the three additional votes needed on these judicial nominees.<br /><br />If however, Republicans mistakenly thought that they could roll the Democrats on this but don't want majority-imposed reform (which, after all, would leave them unable to stop any future nominees), then they'll need to back down, and the question becomes how far. Perhaps they could get a deal in which they only blockade one seat. More likely, they would have to give up the blockade and agree to allow final votes on at least two of the current nominees and a replacement for the other (assuming they want to take their chances with another selection).<br /><br />(Tweeter <a href="https://twitter.com/Mansfield2016/status/402927822798196736">Mansfield 2016</a> reminds us that Democrats want new additional judicial seats, and suggests that could be part of a deal. That's a deal that I think Democrats should be happy to take, but one which Senate Republican dealmakers, unfortunately, can't deliver on because it would require House Republicans to go along. It's worth remember, however, that part of the reason that the DC Circuit's caseload is comparatively low is that Congress has failed for many years now to add seats elsewhere on the federal bench).<br /><br />As long as I'm here, I should mention two arguments I've made in the past that are relevant to this showdown. One is that I don't think the Democrats will push ahead with a bare majority of 50 plus Joe Biden; I think they won't do it without at least 52. I do think they'll have the votes (as Jennifer Bendery's reporting <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/19/senate-filibuster-reform_n_4304091.html?1384890572">confirms</a>) -- in fact, I suspect they'll have 54 of 55, everyone but Levin. But some of the less enthusiastic may only be along for part of the ride; indeed, it's even possible that some of them might just be bluffing, and that Harry Reid knows he can't count on them. That's possible, but I don't believe it's true at this point.<br /><br />The other one is that I really don't give much weight to minority-party threats that they'll shut the Senate down after majority-imposed reform. I expect maybe a few display of outrage, but that they'll fizzle out rapidly.<br /><br />At any rate, it sure looks like we'll know more very soon.<br /><br /><br /><br />*It's actually more complicated. They may be indifferent about judicial filibusters, but want to preserve other filibusters -- and believe that majority-imposed reform on one would lead eventually to elimination of all filibusters. But that doesn't really change the situation described here.<----->Liberals
Catch of the Day4<----->I think this properly should go to Noam Scheiber, although he cites another <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/11/hillary-clinton-vs-elizabeth-warren.html">piece</a> when he <a href="https://twitter.com/noamscheiber/status/402472367428882432">says</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Here's why it doesn't matter if Warren or her fundraisers say she's not running in 16: she cant possibly know herself&nbsp;</blockquote>We can refine this a bit, I suppose. She certainly might know if she's running right now, even though she wouldn't know whether she'll still be running by the Iowa caucuses. And she might want to deny running, even if that's the case. She also might have some reason to be absolutely certain that she would never run, even if the thing dropped in her lap.<br /><br />But for many candidates at this stage, it's more ambiguous, and the particular structure on the Democratic side in this cycle makes it even more so. Presumably there are several potential candidates who are in if Hillary Clinton drops out, but out if she remains in.<br /><br />For Clinton, as many of us have noted, it makes sense to delay the overt candidacy as long as possible; not only does that leave all her options open if she's really undecided, but even if she is clearly running for now there's nothing much to be gained by becoming an overt candidate.<br /><br />The thing is, for Warren or Clinton or whoever, making the move from "doing everything one would need to do to be in a position to being an active candidate in the months leading up to Iowa" to an overt candidacy may very well depend on how the first part of things goes.<br /><br />Which is to say that for actual politicians going through the process, the decision isn't so much of a "if you could be president would you do it" or even a "if you could be the nominee would you do it" as much as it is "considering the chances of winning both the nomination and the general election, which are constantly shifting, is it worth continuing to move forward?" Which leaves two potentially moving variables: the point at which the politician believes it's worth making the run, and the assessment by the candidate of how close she is to that point. What I mean is that some potential candidate (say, Elizabeth Warren) might definitely be up for being president if it was handed to her and definitely wouldn't run if it was a sure loss without having definitively decided exactly what her perceived chances would have to be for her to be an active candidate in 2016. So deciding whether to run really means figuring out both the odds of winning that make it worth running, and what the current odds of winning might be -- which includes both the overall emerging political context and, as time goes on, what's happening in her own not-quite-a-campaign.<br /><br />Combine all that with some legal and some practical political reasons for candidates to avoid overt candidacies until fairly late in the process -- along with a system in which contesting the nomination actually begins (at least) three years before Iowa. So we have good reason to heavily discount whatever they say about their (current? possible?) candidacies.<br /><br />Therefore, in real life, we don't really have two separate piles of candidates and non-candidates; we get a whole bunch of people who are in between. Especially in the first two years of the cycle.<br /><br />In other words? A very good shorthand for all of that is "she can't possibly know herself." So: nice catch!<----->General

Ignore Those Polls! (Small Sample Size Crosstabs Edition)<----->Josh Kraushaar <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/against-the-grain/why-obamacare-is-on-life-support-20131118">also said</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The president isn't just losing his skeptics from the chaotic Obamacare rollout but his allies who stood to gain from the law's benefits -- namely Hispanics, whose approval of the president has dropped more than any demographic subgroup since the problems began.&nbsp;</blockquote>Ignore those polls! Or at least, be very careful about subsamples. Kraushaar published this one early today, before last week's <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/124922/Presidential-Approval-Center.aspx">Gallup numbers</a> were ready; turns out that Obama's approval among Hispanics, per Gallup, is now at 52% -- up three points over two weeks ago, while the overall rate remained stuck at 41%.<br /><br />Or whatever. These kinds of subsamples can be all over the place. As it happens, I had noticed the falloff too...and I had been planning to write this item if it turned around, which it more or less has, even before Kraushaar gave me the additional hook.<br /><br />(Oh, and yes -- the press frenzy of the last two weeks is accompanied by a zero-point decline in approval; Obama is down 2 points overall since the last full week of September, which is the last week before the rollout of the exchanges and the shutdown. Two percentage points. Free fall!).<br /><br />Here's the difference between Obama's overall approval rating and his rating among Hispanics, going back over time, with this week at 52% overall - 41% Hispanic = 11 points:<br /><br />11, 9, 8, 15, 13, 10, 14, 10, 16, 14, 16, 15, 18, 18, 17, 20, 18, 17, 18, 18, 19, 19, 20, 15, 20<br /><br />Going back further, it's around 20 to the beginning of the year, which is as much as Gallup has posted now. So...it does appear that there has probably been a change over time. But the decline started a while ago; that last 20 point gap is at the end of July, and the gap was down to 10 points at the end of September -- before the exchanges, and before the shutdown.<br /><br />If I had to guess, it would be that it's more about immigration disappearing from the news agenda; as budget and health care dominated the news, Latino voters reacted more or less the same as everyone else. But that's a guess! It's impossible to really get any closer to the truth from these numbers. Other than it's unlikely -- not impossible, but unlikely -- that it's reflecting something about the ACA rollout. The sequence just doesn't seem to suggest that.<br /><br />The general point: be very, very, very, very wary about using the subsamples in these kinds of polls. It's incredibly easy to get big jumps that are really just random noise -- look, for example, at the 20-15-20 sequence right at the end there. The odds of getting all worked up over something that isn't real are, unfortunately, very high.<----->Liberals
Obamacare Press Frenzy Stuff<----->Oy, Kraushaar. Oy, Galston. Oy, half the damn press corps. It's ugly out there, folks.<br /><br />The two that set me off in particular today are Josh Kraushaar's <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/against-the-grain/why-obamacare-is-on-life-support-20131118">massive overinterpretation</a> of the events of last week, leading him to believe that Democrats are close to abandoning the ACA. And then Todd Purdom on <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/obamacare-threat-to-liberalism-99975.html#.UonxRnP-MvI.twitter">the imminent collapse of "Big Government progressivism"</a> if the ACA doesn't work well (complete with supporting quotes from William Galston). Anyway, here are some links to what I've written in response.<br /><br />There's just a lot of nonsense right now. Which is pretty much what happens when these press frenzies get started, but it's very frustrating. As I <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/11/16/theyve_learned_nothing_medias_obamacare_coverage_is_humiliating/">wrote</a> over at Salon over the weekend, a good comparison here is Whitewater, of all things; yes, there is a substantive story on health care reform here, but what the press are up to is mostly just fantasy.<br /><br />Today, I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/11/18/no-democrats-are-not-turning-against-the-affordable-care-act/">took on</a> Kraushaar's argument that the Upton vote was about Democrats turning against the ACA. As I <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/ive-seen-this-one-before.html">said</a> last week...no, it really isn't.<br /><br />Oh, and then there's the "doom for liberalism" argument. On Friday, I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/11/15/the-consequences-of-an-affordable-care-act-failure/">pointed out</a> that public opinion doesn't work that way.<br /><br />I'll dredge up a couple of other relevant posts from a while back. At the beginning of the month, I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/11/01/the-gop-push-for-obamacare-repeal-is-dead/">argued</a> that "repeal" really is dead; the status quo ante has been disrupted far too much to ever return to it. Whatever happens in the future, it will be building on the new, ACA status quo, not repealing it and returning to the past arrangements. And I've also been <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/11/06/ignore-the-spin-war-about-obamacare-its-irrelevant-rinse-repeat/">saying</a> that the spin at this point is irrelevant; what matters is whether the law works.<----->Liberals

I'm obviously not alone in this, but he was my guy: the last player older than me in the majors. Or anywhere in organized ball, as far as I know. Ah well. My cohort was obviously pretty lucky in that respect. A wonderful career.<br /><br />Good stuff:<br /><br />1. As one who agrees with the courts that partisan gerrymandering is kosher by the Constitution, I nevertheless agree very much with Rick Hasen about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/16/opinion/voter-suppressions-new-pretext.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0">voter suppression and the Constitution</a>. That is, courts "should hold that when a state passes a law that burdens voters, it must demonstrate, with credible evidence, that the burdens are justified by a good reason and that the laws are tailored to their intended purpose." Actually, that doesn't even seem strong enough to me, but it's a good start. Voting should be easy, full stop.<br /><br />2. Peter Ubertaccio on why Barack Obama <a href="http://www.masspoliticsprofs.com/2013/11/17/the-presidents-neustadtian-nightmare/">can't really do much about public opinion</a>.

Friday Baseball Post4<----->Haven't done one of these for a while, and I know exactly why: I've really lost interest in the postseason awards.<br /><br />I'm not really sure why. I'm certainly not any less of a baseball fan than I used to be. I'm just as interested as ever in the HOF, which one would think would be similar. But the postseason awards? If one of the Giants has a shot at it, I'll root for him, and otherwise...well, I'll notice them. I might read a couple of items. That's about it.<br /><br />I used to vote at the Internet Baseball Awards (I used to vote back when they were conducted over USENET, actually). I don't, any more. Don't even check to see who won most years.<br /><br />So what is it? Is it associated with age? Anyone else lose interest in the postseason awards as they got older? I mean, I'm not <i>that</i> old. Anyone find themselves more interested now than they used to be?<br /><br />My best guess is that -- and you're going to think this is silly -- a big part of it for me might have to do with how they changed the way the awards rolled out. Not that the new style is worse. Just that it's different, and that lost some of the fun of it for me. I mean, part of the reason that the postseason awards "count" is because we all believe in them, even those of us who believe in them as a thing to knock down. And one reason I think I believe in them was because they always showed up on the same schedule, slowly, after the World Series. Once they started messing with the schedule, and lately with the rest of the presentation, it just changed it for me. Yes, it's silly.<br /><br />There are other possibilities. For years, I was involved in regular baseball conversation (usenet, and then I was on one or another mailing list for a long time)...I don't really have an ongoing baseball conversation to capture my attention about whatever's going on. But it's not as if those conversations aren't available to me, or that I don't remain interested in other baseball topics.<br /><br />Or, who knows, plenty of possibilities. I am curious about whether it's me that's changed or the awards. Who knows: maybe I'll wind up totally into them next year. But for now, not so much.<----->Sports
I've Seen This One Before<----->Today the House is scheduled to vote for the Upton bill, at least unless conservatives decide at the last minute that it really is a fix, and therefore helping Obamacare.<br /><br />Some Democrats will vote for it.<br /><br />A quick hint: House Democratic votes for Upton, in a situation in which the bill won't be coming to the Senate floor, may be an indication that Republicans have successfully crafted a bill that puts pressure on Democrats to split their votes. But it's not an indication that Democrats are abandoning the ACA.<br /><br />This happened just a month ago, when Republicans during the shutdown brought up a series of mini-CRs and successfully peeled off some Democrats on those, too. Some Republicans convinced themselves at the time that this was an indication that Democrats were splitting, and that Republicans were going to win the shutdown. We know how that turned out.<br /><br />Whether it's a deliberate leadership strategy or not, House Democrats worried about re-election appear perfectly willing to defect on symbolic votes set up by Republicans to make political points. Nancy Pelosi and the leadership are either unable to prevent it, or -- more likely -- don't care and don't try to prevent it. <br /><br />So when Yuval Levin <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/364038/president-losing-his-plan-yuval-levin">predicts</a> that Democrats who vote for Upton "might well never come back to the Obamacare fold," don't believe it. There's an enormous difference between playing along on a symbolic vote and abandoning a policy Democrats are stuck with, like it or not. And the truth is: most of them almost certainly do like it. What's more, as long as there's no plausible alternative that could work better for them, they really, at the end of the day, have little choice.<br /><br />At any rate, whatever the chances are that they eventually bail on ACA, this vote isn't about that. Just as symbolic votes during the shutdown didn't indicated that Democrats were divided (or, for that matter, that Republicans were unified). If Republicans do make that mistake again...well, at least they'll be consistent.<----->Conservatives

Pressler, last seen when defeated in 1996, would be, yes, <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2011/03/buddy-roemer-captain-bateson-class.html">a Bateson class Senate candidate</a>. I really want that to catch on; perhaps the low odds of it happening have something to do with how I have to look it up every time I mention it to remember the Kelsey Grammer character name.

Impeachment!<----->Well, not the president. Just the Attorney General. And not actual impeachment; just a few radicals <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/house-republicans-eric-holder-impeachment-99845.html?hp=r1">planning to introduce articles of impeachment</a> today.<br /><br />Ah, but this is as good an opportunity as any to admit I was pretty much dead wrong about this one. I <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2010/02/impeachment-update.html">thought</a> someone would formally introduce articles of impeachment against Barack Obama long ago. Not that they would actually go ahead an impeach him.<br /><br />I will note that my prediction wasn't just "someone" -- I picked Michele Bachmann. Which, granted, wasn't really a wild stretch, but it turns out she's one of the group gunning for Holder. So I'm not entirely, totally wrong. Just missed the target. And the date, by three years. And they're not even picking a symbolic date, at least as far as I know. And she's apparently not even the lead on it. So, really, well, that's pretty bad predicting.<br /><br />OK, as predictions go, this one wasn't entirely, well, scientific. Just having a little fun. But, alas (or not I suppose), wrong.<br /><br />Good predictions? As of today, that goes to commenter Drew:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">I'll be the contrarian and say that none of them will, barring any significant crime (which I strongly doubt will happen).</blockquote>A tentative congratulations to Drew. Nice work! <br /><br />And congratulations, also tentative but so far, to the GOP House leadership for somehow keeping anyone from filing impeachment against the president.<----->Conservatives
Electoral Effects of the...Oh, C'mon, People, Really?<----->Sometimes, I think it helps to be a solid 1500 miles away from Washington. Or maybe it helps to have read a little history. Or maybe I'm just an old guy.<div><br /></div><div>Anyway: we're at a point at which even Jonathan Chait, <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/11/congressional-democrats-freak-out-over-obamacare.html">writing against panic</a>, says that "the current sense of dread enveloping the Democratic Party has a very real basis. President Obamas poll numbers are plunging to unprecedented depths."</div><div><br /></div><div>Yes, it's all massively overstated.</div><div><br /></div><div>Plunging? His approval (and some associated numbers) have definitely dropped. I suppose "plunge" is subjective, but <a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/obama-job-approval#!">HuffPollster's estimate</a>, set for "less smoothing" and therefore (over?) sensitive to recent polls, is that he's lost maybe 2.5 percentage points over the last five or so weeks. He's been losing ground all year including, mostly likely, during the shutdown. Depending on what adjustments one does, that might have accelerated after the shutdown, or maybe not. It doesn't sound like a "plunge" to me.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Obama's popularity is probably at the low point of his presidency (again, depending on the adjustments, he's either a bit below or a bit above his previous low. But it's not any kind of unusually low low point (he's nowhere near Truman, Carter, Nixon, W.), there's no particular reason to expect the slump to continue, and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/11/12/lets-kill-off-this-myth-about-second-term-presidents/">myths aside</a> no reason to believe he won't recover if the news turns better. Granted, it's hard to know what to expect from healthcare.gov, but it's not as if it's getting worse over time. I'm not saying his numbers will go up. Just that it's more or less equally likely as further drops.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>(Actually...if I had to guess, I'd say a run of either stability or improvement is probably more likely, at least if the next budget deadlines come and go quietly. Gallup's economic confidence index has been steadily recovering from its shutdown/debt limit plunge -- yes, that one was a real plunge -- and Jamelle Bouie is right that the economy is a very big part of presidential approval, although I think he somewhat understates the ability of other events to matter).</div><div><br /></div><div>As for electoral effects? I wrote an item <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/10/electoral-effects-of-shutdown.html">dismissing direct electoral effects</a> of the shutdown against Republicans back last month; that post pretty much works now, in reverse for effects against Democrats. I should say: it's far easier for sentiment against the president to translate into midterm electoral losses than it is for feelings against the out-party. So if Obama is unpopular in November 2014, it will hurt Democrats. But today's frenzy about the ACA is going to be mostly forgotten by then, one way or another, just as the shutdown seems forgotten today. That's probably even true, believe it or not, if the program totally collapses, although I don't think that's going to happen.</div><div><br /></div><div>Anyway, Obama's approval ratings have in fact fallen from the mid-40s to the low-40s, and over the course of the year from around 50 to the low 40s. It's obviously not good news for him, but it seems a lot less dramatic than a lot of the chatter this week would have it be.&nbsp;</div><----->General

Gridlock/Polarization<----->National Journal is running a funny-looking chart of <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/this-is-what-congressional-gridlock-looks-like-in-1-chart-20131113">partisan polarization in the House with this explanatio</a>n:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">If you're looking for a quick fact to explain congressional gridlock, it's this: In the 113th Congress, only 59 members have voted with the majority of their party less than 90 percent of the time (20 Republicans and 39 Democrats).</blockquote>So first of all, a minor point: "Congress" here apparently means the House.<br /><br />Second: polarization -- partisan polarization -- just means that Members vote with their party and against theother party. Gridlock is about failure to pass legislation. Indeed, really more specific; to go back to the traffic analogy, it's about failure to pass legislation that everyone wants, but is being blocked by collective action failure of some type.<br /><br />Which is to say that gridlock and polarization are not the same thing, and not necessarily related in any straightforward way.<br /><br />Indeed, within the House, partisan polarization should ease gridlock. Since the House runs by majority party, if that party is unified, then they can basically do whatever they want.<br /><br />Thus in the historic 111th Congress, in 2009-2010, the House was extremely productive. Very strong polarization, and no gridlock at all.<br /><br />The Senate, with the filibuster forcing supermajorities, is another story; there, polarization might make gridlock more likely assuming that the majority party has fewer than 60 Senators. However, with 60 Senators, and given unified government, polarization should mean less, not more, gridock.<br /><br />What about with divided government? Does polarization then mean gridlock?<br /><br />Not necessarily. A non-polarized Congress can avoid gridlock by having different majorities express themselves on different issues. On the other hand, a non-polarized Congress also can create a lot more gridlock. After all, a polarized Congress means that one person can bargain for her whole party; a non-polarized Congress can devolve into an ungovernable mess (indeed, one theory of why parties exist at all is that legislatures don't really work well without them).<br /><br />In other words, the relationship between polarization and gridlock is complicated.<br /><br />What does cause gridlock, however, is a party driven by aversion to compromise -- both internally and with the other party. That's what's happening now, with the dysfunctional GOP. And that, not polarization, is most likely the primary source of current gridlock.<----->Conservatives
What Are Republicans Thinking on Filibusters?<----->At this point in the current filibuster showdown, most of the focus is on <a href="http://blogs.rollcall.com/wgdb/democrats-nuclear-option-judges/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">what the Democrats will do</a>, with Republicans blockading three seats on the DC Circuit Court. It seems to me that Democrats will have little choice but to threaten majority-imposed rules change and, if necessary, carry out that threat. But what are Republicans thinking? I have no idea, but there seem to be several possibilities.<br /><br />1. They don't believe Democrats will really go through with majority-imposed reform.<br /><br />2. They're bluffing. They intend to fold at the last minute, just as they did over executive branch nominations during the last confrontation.<br /><br />3. They're not bluffing, and they don't think the Democrats are bluffing -- they want to get rid of the filibuster, and want the Democrats to be the ones who do it.<br /><br />4. Collectively, they want to back down. However, the <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/07/how-senate-deal-is-working.html">tag-team method</a> they've been using to lose on cloture votes by relatively narrow margins have broken down; they can't find five Republicans to take the potential re-nomination hit of voting for cloture.<br /><br />Or perhaps it's a mistake to suggest that "the Republicans" are thinking anything as a group. After all, these are 45 individual, autonomous politicians; there may be all sorts of mixed combinations of what's going on here. For example, it could be that 20 or so Republican Senators are in column #3 and want to get rid of the filibuster, and then another 20 or so are just afraid to vote against those first twenty...and then a few more are really just bluffing. Or are really reading the Democrats as bluffing.<br /><br />As I said: I have no idea what's going on here, and therefore what the likely end game might be. Perhaps we'll learn more as we move towards the third cloture vote. I have to say: I'm not predicting anything, but I'm not as optimistic as I was last time that they're going to strike a deal.<----->Conservatives
Read Stuff, You Should24<----->Happy Birthday to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0175814/">Frances Conroy</a>, 60. <br /><br />Ah, a little good stuff:<br /><br />1. Sarah Binder <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2013/11/12/what-senate-cloture-votes-tell-us-about-obstruction/">on counting filibusters and "blocking."</a> <br /><br />2. Great post by Stan Collender on <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/stan-collender/2788/why-most-important-budget-event-year-has-had-no-impact">why no one paid attention to the new budget deficit numbers</a> -- it's a great example of agenda setting, or in this case negative agenda setting. The one thing worth adding, from the White House point of view: a rapidly decreasing deficit is "objectively" lower; whether it's an improvement is more complicated, though. Best, as Collender says, to just duck the whole issue.<br /><br />3. Ta-Nehisi Coates <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/11/richard-cohen-in-context/281426/">vs. Richard Cohen</a> is hardly a fair fight: the best blogger out there against perhaps the worst columnist? <br /><br />4.

Why I Expect Nothing Out of Bauer-Ginsberg<----->Sparked by my dismissal of the president's electoral administration commission yesterday, Rick Hasen got an update about <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/?p=56681&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+electionlawblog%2FuqCP+%28Election+Law%29">what the Bauer-Ginsberg Commission is up to</a>. Short answer: holding hearings, doing research, planning on a January report.<br /><br />Which is all fine, and I have nothing against Bob Bauer and Ben Ginsberg.<br /><br />But I'll stick to <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/02/a-disappointing-voting-initiative.html">what I said</a> back in February: a presidential commission is the wrong way of going about this, and Bauer and Ginsberg are the wrong people to head it if the goal is to really change things.<br /><br />In particular: presidential commissions are excellent for one kind of situation: when everyone agrees on what should be done, but no one wants the credit (or blame). That's why I want a presidential commission dedicated to slashing vetting for executive branch nominations; presidents don't want to admit that the costs of allowing a few bad apples through are much lower than the costs associated with the current system, nor do they want to have their own reforms blamed when the inevitable bad apples show up. On top of that, presidents aren't likely to want to admit that there's nothing wrong with having some nominees who might, looked at in just the right angle, present an appearance of a conflict of interest.<br /><br />If Obama had presented a serious proposal back in February...well, it probably would have died, but perhaps it could have passed the Senate, and there's always a chance it could have been tossed in to whatever omnibus bill was going through. And I suppose it's still possible that the commission will produce something worthwhile and that Obama will push it hard.<br /><br />But a much more likely outcome is that we get a lowest common denominator report from the commission, avoiding anything that either party objects to, and after the story appears on page A17 that's the end of it until the same problems show up in 2014 and 2016.<----->Obama
Catch of the Day5<-----><div class="tr_bq"><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/11/12/the-morning-plum-white-house-braces-for-terrible-obamacare-enrollment-numbers/">Greg Sargent</a>&nbsp;(his emphasis)</div><blockquote>Lets face it, the spin war over initial low enrollment figures just doesnt matter that much. Because the story here is the same as it always was: <i>All that matters is whether the policy works in the long run.</i><br /><br />If it does, then all of the spin of the moment  <i>low enrollment proves the law is in total collapse! Red state Dems are fleeing the wreckage wholesale</i>!  will be forgotten entirely, and Republicans will have to readjust to a political landscape in which the law is working for lots and lots of people. If it doesnt  if the website doesnt work in the new year, or if enrollment figures remain too low over time, causing the exchanges to collapse  then all bets will be off anyway.</blockquote>Yes, and yes. And he's also correct that the best play for the administration is to be as open about the statistics involved as possible.<br /><br />I'm mostly still sticking with what I said a while ago, which is that ultimately the web site problems won't destroy the program. They certainly could cause a lot of disruption, though; Brian Beutler <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/11/12/gop_about_to_hurt_itself_again_new_ploy_to_kill_obamacare_will_blow_up/">points out</a> that if it really is impossible to enroll at the same time that current plans are discontinued, then that's an enormous problem mostly separate from all the hype about "keep your plan," and it's a problem with no real obvious solution. Other than, you know, to get the damn program working.<br /><br />And, yes, as Sarah Kliff <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/11/12/its-not-quite-time-to-freak-out-over-obamacares-enrollment-number/">says today</a>, what's important is who signs up as much as it is how many.<br /><br />But regardless: the law is here, it's being implemented, half a million people have signed up for Medicaid, young adults are on their parents' plans, the donut hole is disappearing and other Medicare benefits have begun, lifetime and yearly caps and rescissions are gone...all of that is going to be very, very, difficult to displace. So when Greg says -- and I agree -- what matters is whether ACA works or not, what it matters to is the next wave of reform and change. Repeal? No, we're never going back to the status quo ante. <br /><br />Spin over first-month signups, meanwhile, won't affect any of that.<br /><br />Nice catch!<----->Obama
Plain Blogger Smackdown<-----><div class="tr_bq">Over at Greg's place yesterday, I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/11/11/u-s-elections-are-still-awful-we-should-fix-that/">used</a> the hook of Virginia's wild count in the AG election as an excuse to call for more attention to election administration.&nbsp;</div><br />Reid Wilson <a href="https://twitter.com/PostReid/status/400014048752062464">liked it</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Good point from @jbplainblog: States really aren't that good at administering elections</blockquote>And then a backlash started.<br /><br /><a href="https://twitter.com/ElectProject/status/400017184107151360">Michael McDonald</a>:<br /><blockquote>usually don't see errors from election night reporting &gt;&gt; cavass. Virginia very transparent<br /><br />unfair to VA election officials to use that transparency against them</blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/HHHElections/status/400016495281188864">HHH Election Program</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">With all due respect, it's a silly argument; states are just using the canvass to make sure count is right</blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/TheBradBlog/status/400018911678443520">Brad Friedman</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Totally unfair. VA, so far, doing an EXCELLENT job of public canvass. (Voting machines a diff issue.)</blockquote>I'll take the blame here. I didn't really intend to imply that the small changes in the canvass are evidence of Virginia doing anything wrong, but I'm responsible for it coming out that way.<br /><br />More to the point: I'm responsible for using the messiness that's inevitable whenever anyone looks closely at an election as a hook for arguing for better election administration in general. It's a fair point that any election, no matter how well run, is going to look messy when it's basically tied after 2.2M votes.<br /><br />That said: my intention wasn't to bash the people doing the work in Virginia, but an overall system of election administration that is neglected, underfunded, and overly partisan. Which it is.<br /><br />And so I think the intended argument of the post was just fine. But, you know, see above.<----->General
