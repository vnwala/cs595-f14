   My name is Serena Boadway, and I am a single mother of two teenagers.
   One of my children was a patient at Arkansas Children's Hospital
   several times when he was younger while a wide variety of tests were
   performed on him to try and diagnose his condition.  I will never
   forget the encouragement and helpfulness of the staff nor the looks on
   the faces of the other children and family members we would see while
   we were there. Thankfully, my son never had an overnight visit with
   them. I know this is not the case in the majority of the families we
   would see while we were there. While it has been several years since my
   son was a patient, I am finally in a position where I can help raise
   much-needed funding for this wonderful establishment.
   Please send donated items for the auction to:
   ACH Fundraiser c/o Serena Boadway, P.O. Box 1371, Mount Ida, AR 71957
