   Using a robotic arm, a light source is carried through precise
   movements in front of a camera. Photographic compositions are recorded
   as images of volumetric light. Robotic light “painting” can also be
   inverted: the camera is moved via the arm to create an image “painted”
   with environmental light. Finally, adding real-time sensor input to the
   moving arm and programming it to explore the physical space around
   objects can reveal immaterial fields like radio waves, magnetic fields,
