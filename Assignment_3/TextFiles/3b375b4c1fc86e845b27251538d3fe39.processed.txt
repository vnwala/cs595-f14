SWEATER WEATHER

   image

   2 weeks of school and I honestly haven’t done anything productive yet.
   I think I’m still on vacation mode because my mind won’t process
   anything I’ve been learning in school. I was given loads of reading
   homework but I honestly didn’t take much time reading and trying to
   understand them. Either I go to the mall with some of my friends to eat
   or window shop, or I stay in to doze off after attending my classes and
   watch How I Met Your Mother or local television shows all night.

   image

   One of the reasons why I’m still not over being a couch potato all day
   or just chilling around somewhere else is probably the suspension of
   classes just 2 days after our first day in school because of a typhoon.
   It is expected during the first week not to do anything huge or
   important in class so I didn’t really worry about anything
   school-related. I just stayed in and lived my lazy life. But whatever,
   I know I have to deal with all these things and do all my
   responsibilities as a student. So, yeah.

   image

   Well, anyway….. I’m on my model status.. Lol joke =))

   So, that’s me. I’m one hell of a procrastinator. I’m actually blogging
   tonight because I don’t want to face my school notes yet. Haha! I don’t
   know why I like cramming and then work under pressure. Maybe because my
   brain is focused and is forced to think so all the ideas come rushing
   in. But I promise to study after posting this, okay! Hahaha.

   image

   Sweater weather is on! I honestly hate it when it rains, especially
   when I’m out. The only advantage I see is that the plants all over the
   place get watered, plus the cold breeze the rain brings. It’s been
   really hot here in the Philippines during summer, so it’s really a
   relief when the rainy season has come. We just pray that it doesn’t
   rain hard and nobody gets victimized by the strong rain and wind.

   image

   image

   This cropped knitted sweater (which was on sale when I got it, yaaa)
   lets me cover up but doesn’t suffocate my body. The temperature here in
   the PH is pretty high when it doesn’t rain, so this kind of top is
   comfortable enough for me. And of course, I wore my high-waisted
   leather shorts so I wouldn’t have to show my tummy. :D

   image

   image

   We all know how perfect leather boots are for a cool weather. ;-)

COORDINATES

   image

   (Blazer, bag, necklace and earrings from [19]Glamorosa, Basic top and
   shorts from [20]Forever 21, Shoes from [21]Mags)

   image

   If you look into my closet, I don’t have a anything suited or
   “terno” except my sleepwear. I once thought of buying something like it
   when it became a trend because I can wear them all over again using
   another pieces of clothing. I can mix-and-match them with anything I
   have.

   image

   image

   But just like what I told you, I never had anything suited. I only had
   color-coordinated clothes right here which is extremely cute for me.
   Isn’t mint green a very nice color to look at? Plus, it feels very cool
   in the eyes.

   Coordinates are usually of prints but today I wore them according to
   their color shade. No need to buy a pair because you can play with the
   clothes you already own. It’s like an improvised coordinates! Haha.

   image

   image

   I am so in love with this pair of shoes. It has a clear strap in front
   which makes your feet look like it’s just glued on the wedges. It’s so
   unique and the colorful woven design is just too cute!

   image

   Before I end this post, I want you guys to know that I’ll be a tad bit
   busy the coming weeks (not that I’m very active lol but yeah) because
   school will finally start next week! Wish me luck on my sophomore year
   in college, yas! ;-)

CHROMATIC

   image

   (Dress from Hong Kong, Shoes from Juan, Headband from [25]Forever 21)

   image

   Just because rainy season has already started doesn’t mean you can’t
   wear vibrant colors anymore. Why not relive the season of summer by
   wearing such?

   image

   The weather’s been very gloomy lately. So it’s nice to see a glimpse of
   color every now and then by wearing something like it. Most of the
   people now prefer wearing sweaters or jeans to protect themselves from
   the cold rain. I don’t know but I ain’t over summer just yet.

   image

   image

   So I’m showing you this beautiful maxi dress that caught my heart on
   the spot. The details and colors are simply super lovely and
   eye-catchy.

   image

   I like how this dress shows a little skin but covers more. Some people
   are okay with tank tops and short shorts, while others are not very
   comfortable showing their skin off. I like how this dress reveals half
   of my back but covers my entire thighs and legs. It’s like saying that
   you don’t have to show too much just because everyone else does during
   summer. If the backless part of the dress still leave you conscious
   about yourself, you can always cover up by using cardigans or scarves.

   image

   I’m not very tall so I wore these platforms to pull off the dress more
   appropriately.

   image

   You know you can always wear anything you want as long as you’re pretty
   much comfortable and confident with it. No season can stop you from
   dressing up just like how you want to. :-)

CROCHET

   image

   image

   (Top from Hong Kong, Skirt from Wilson, Watch from [29]Anne Klein, Bag
   from [30]Mango, Shoes from Brash)

   Personally, I don’t like wearing bandage skirts. I don’t like how it
   hugs my figure very tightly. I am honestly bloated and I don’t want
   people seeing how huge my tummy is (lol). But guess what? I’ve decided
   to at least give it a try and yay I’m really happy I did! I just had to
   wear a longer blouse and wear it untucked to cover my insecurity and at
   least be confident with how I’ll look.
   I decided to pair it with this dainty top that I fell in love with the
   first time I saw it. The color of the fabric is fab, needless to say.
   Just look at the cold shoulder design! Okay, I’ll let the crochet do
   all the talking. ~

NOT A BAD THING

   image

   (Shirt from [34]The Ranz Project, Shorts from [35]Herbench, Necklace
   from [36]Cotton On, Sunglasses from [37]Fly Shades, Shoes from
   [38]Nike, Bag from [39]Bruno Rossi)

   image

   Not A Bad Thing is Justin Timberlake’s new single and it’s wonderful.
   It’s never too late to listen to it if you haven’t yet! I don’t
   particularly know why I chose that song as the title of this post, but
   whatever, it’s JT’s! Haha. And yeaaaah I’m wearing JT on mah shirt :P

   One of my favorite songs of him is Mirrors. I don’t know about you
   guys, but I love this song. It was explained that the song talks about
   holding onto the person you love when you think he/she is already the
   one. JT explained the meaning of his song via Hollywood Life. He said,
   “One of the most valuable things in a relationship is being able to
   constantly change and be individual, but look to the other side to the
   person that you’re with and and know that they’re changing as well
   individually, but somehow you two can mirror each other and be the
   other half of that world that you both create.” I mean, seriously, who
   wouldn’t love him?! (haha)

   image

   Not only does he sing well, he’s much of a performer too! If you
   haven’t seen his Grammy Awards performance last 2013 yet, I think you
   have to. He also has this look that can make your heart melt on the
   spot.Plus, he can act well. He’s a complete package of a total
   entertainer.

   image

   image

   This digitally-printed pocket tee from [40]The Ranz Project is genius.
   They have a lot of other designs on which you can choose from. Justin
   is one of my favorite artists, so I guess that explains why I’m wearing
   this shirt.

   image

   image

   I wore this pair of shoes to add color and accent so I wouldn’t look
   too boring. It also somehow matches my sunglasses!

   image

   Personally, I like wearing high-waisted anything (lol like shorts,
   skirts or pants) because I think it suits my body type. Determining
   your body type or shape can also help you decide on what you should and
   should not wear. You can find out what will fit you well the most and
   which type of clothing would compliment your body. Wanna know yours? My
   best friend Google gave me this link, find out [41]here.
