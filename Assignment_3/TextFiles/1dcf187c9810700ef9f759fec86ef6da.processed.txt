[7]The Isolating Illness

   I'm almost certain that everyone living with an illness feels isolated
   from everyone else at some stage, especially if you're the only one in
   your family or friendship circle with it. I often battle with this,
   sometimes on a daily basis, sometimes once in a blue moon, but it still
   happens even though I've had Crohn's now for about 7 years.
   A few months ago I experience a "minor" flare-up, which had me off work
   for 8 weeks. It was pretty devastating, more so because I'd started my
   new job as a Copywriter a few months before. I felt awful to say the
   least. I'd go as far as saying I felt like a failure because I couldn't
   keep this invisible illness in check. But what I kept forgetting during
   those moments of beating myself up was that it wasn't the end of the
   road for me. Yes I had to take time off work in order to get better,
   but my job was still there. I also may have been on bed rest for what
   felt like 10 years, but what was I really missing out on? The commute
   to work? Seeing friends? Seeing family? Of which both friends and
   family rallied round me as much as they could so that I wasn't "alone".
   It was a difficult time. It's always a difficult time when you're in
   constant pain and the thought of getting out of bed is too much because
   everything will hurt. But one day I just had to stop feeling sorry for
   myself and get the heck out of bed. I chose to put on a fancy top even
   though I wasn't going anywhere. I just couldn't stomach seeing myself
   in leggings and a baggy Tee anymore (not quite a pun but let's just say
   it is lol). I binge-watched a lot of TV series' and read some great
   books, which I'll share in a separate post.
   To everyone living with an illness today, whether Crohn's Disease or
   not, you're not alone. It might feel like you are. Hell, it'll even
   feel like "no one understaaaaaands" what you're going through (yes I
   often said it just like that), but they do to a certain extent. Does
   that give you comfort? Probably not. But the point I'm getting at is
   you're only alone if you choose not to let people be there for you in
   whatever way they can. And if you're family and friends don't know what
   you're feeling, tell them. You don't have to share all the
   not-so-glamourous details, but tell them you'd appreciate their company
   so you don't feel so isolated when the horrible thoughts come. If they
   don't know how you feel, they won't always gather round you when you
   need it most.
   That's all from me today guys, but don't let the illness keep you away
   from the good things in life.
    Stay strong and keep smiling x

[22]I'm back!

   Hey all!
   It's been SUCH a long time since I've blogged and I've missed it so
   much!
   A few weeks after my last post I started my new job (yay!) as a
   Copywriter for quite a big Bank, so you can imagine I've been crazy
   busy. I've now settled into my job and I love it more than I can say.
   As with most things though, stress plays a part in it and unfortunately
   for us with a "stress-related illness", your body begins to suffer just
   a tad (actually,way more than a "tad"). I suffered a minor setback and
   had a flare-up, so I was pretty much bed bound for about 8 weeks, and
   that was after catching the flare at the "early stages" :-|.
   Seeing as it's my first post in a few months, I'm going to keep it
   brief for now, but I do have a LOT to talk about. A lot of my
   forthcoming posts will include things I've done over the summer, what
   helps me relax during flares, balancing work life with Crohn's and a
   little bit of this and that (probably a lot of actually) just to keep
   you entertained.
   I intend to keep on blogging about Crohn's Disease until everyone and
   anyone will feel comfortable talking about it. If you've been diagnosed
   with it recently, or you've had it a while, continue to fight the good
   fight and live life to the max! Having an illness doesn't stop you from
   achieving your goals, it's just a little stumbling block that can be
   overcome in due course.
   Wishing you all the best on this fine Sunday morning :-)
   Keep smiling and stay absolutely fabulous!

[35]Take Crohn's One Day at a Time

   When I think about my journey with Crohn's Disease, I'm very much
   reminded of a chorus we used to sing in Primary School - just a few
   years back. It goes *clears throat*:
   Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
   Thursday, Friday, Saturday too
   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 days
   Each day different
   And every day new
   If I could describe to you how life with Crohn's Disease is, it would
   be the last two sentences. For me, those words apply when Crohn's is in
   remission and when I'm experiencing a flare - especially when I'm on
   Prednisolone, that bittersweet medicine - because each day brings
   something different. It's not always a negative though, some days I'm
   happy because I'll go to the toilet 3 times instead of 5. (That's a
   pretty big deal!) It could also be something as simple as my stomach
   deciding not to gurgle every time the room goes dead silent - I can't
   even remember how many times I've had to try and cough over that noise.
   It sounds like our current windy situation, but louder and extremely
   embarrassing!
   However, now that Crohn's is in remission, I still have to be as
   cautious as anything, if not more so, because any little thing could
   trigger a flare. For instance, I know that eating certain foods have
   the ability to cause an explosion, so to speak, in the nether regions,
   so I simply stay away. (I do still have moments where I want to indulge
   in the "forbidden" foods, but it's not always worth it when you're
   stuck to the loo the next day). For instance, that delicious Burger you
   see, the one with the Sesame Seeds on - clearly I need to rethink how I
   take pictures if I ever want to show you the meat - was absolutely
   divine, but the Habanero jam (pretty much chillies) caused a bit of a
   disturbance the very next day.

                            [36][IMG_3483.jpg]
              [37]Gourmet Burger Kitchen's Habanero with Sweet
                 Potato Fries - it was delicious but deadly

   I'll admit I chose the burger at my own risk, I'm usually better at
   making my food choices, but that night I just wanted it and it was
   amazing even if it messed me up a tad. But what I suggest, that I'm
   sure you all know, is to keep a food diary and stick with it. Mine is
   more of a mental diary than a physical one because I've had Crohn's for
   a while now, but at least I know what sets me off and what keeps my
   insides relatively normal. It's a good idea in the long run though,
   you'll feel like you've got a portion of your life back simply because
   of the foods you choose to eat and drink.
   No song is complete without it's ending, so I've decided to add it in
   for the fun of it - it pretty much sums up our British weather.
   Wet days, dry days, bright days, cloudy days
   Hot days, cold days, windy days too
   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 days
   Each day different
   And every day new
   So every time you feel like you can't take anymore, think of this
   simple children's song and remember that things will turn around
   eventually. It's not the immediate remedy we're all hoping for, but
   your symptoms will calm down over a period of time. It'll seem like
   forever, as it did for me, but there's light at the end of the tunnel
   and slowly but surely you'll make it through - one day at a time.
   Monitor what triggers your symptoms and do your best to avoid it at all
   times - unlike me with the Habanero Jam. *Epic fail*
   Happy Sunday guys, remember to keep smiling and stay fabulous,
   Sam xx

[53]Be Bold and Forget Crohn's

   I'm sure you're all thinking, how on earth can I forget Crohn's? Is she
   for real? Yes I am. Obviously I know you can't forget the fact that
   you've got an inconvenient invisible illness - awesome alliteration Ha!
   I did it again - that gets in the way of everyday life. It knows
   exactly how to stop you in your tracks and not in a
   Knight-in-shining-armour type of way. (I admit, that would be pretty
   amazing).
   So...how do you forget Crohn's? Quite easily, doll yourself up! Put on
   an outfit that makes you feel like a million bucks. It doesn't have to
   be the most expensive item you own, just make it look expensive so that
   you feel über confident. And if you aren't going anywhere, just put on
   a touch of makeup, it will bring out the best side of you. Or if the
   medication you're on gives you spots, it'll mask over them and keep you
   looking flawless.

                             [54][IMG_3715.jpg]
             I chose my Topshop Denim Shirt with my Heavy-Weight
                      Leggings & a Statement necklace.

   There is a point to all of what I'm saying - stick with me. By playing
   dress up, you're drawing your attention away from feeling so rotten and
   sorry for yourself. I remember when I was admitted to hospital, I wore
   a tracksuit and put a dressing gown over it and walked like I had the
   world of my shoulders. My mum ordered me to go upstairs and change into
   something that makes me look like I belong somewhere. At the time I
   didn't see the big deal, but looking back I realised the way I carried
   myself was driving me further into depression. I didn't have a care in
   the world because I was unwell, in pain and felt miserable about
   everything. Living with an illness can do that to you, but sometimes
   you just have to force yourself to put on something other than track
   suit bottoms and a baggy tee - it's just not cute and won't make you
   feel it no matter how comfortable you are.
   So we have Crohn's Disease...Do we have to look like our bodies are
   falling apart? Certainly not. You might get a few people saying, "you
   don't look sick at all". Don't get frustrated or upset, simply reply,
   "Thanks, that was the look I was going for". After all, why should we
   look the way we feel? Surely looking ill is going to make you feel even
   more terrible about yourself - especially when someone chooses to
   highlight it.
   So if this illness malarky is stopping you from feeling like a happy
   person or the former you before the dreaded diagnosis, here's what you
   need to do. Stop looking at your old clothes and thinking how amazing
   they were, you'll fit into them again. Buy some Shapewear or Spanx, and
   then welcome aboard all things Jersey. It's totally forgiving on the
   hips tum and bum, and you won't feel like a balloon in a potato sack.
   Purchase some gorgeous makeup that will cover over those annoying
   stress spots or whatever side effect the medication brings. What you're
   doing is taking your mind off of Crohn's and being kind to yourself. It
   doesn't take the pain away, but don't you look good?!
   So from me to you, be bold with your outfits and makeup and forget your
   illness. Dress to make you happy. Don't worry about the Jeans, maybe
   it's time you started wearing more dresses and skirts anyway. Don't
   tell me you're stomach or your bum is too big, you'll look great and
   the clothes will make you look amazing! Trick your body into recovery,
   and if it doesn't necessarily take the pain away - as I didn't imagine
   it would - at least you'll look gorgeous full stop!
   Put on some makeup and tweet me your best looks ([55]@smdee13)! I can't
   wait to see it :-)
   Here's some of mine with my lovely sister:
   [56][IMG_3701.jpg]
   [57][IMG_3699.jpg]

                            [58][IMG_3712.jpg]
             This shirt was ironed, it just got creased because
        I've been sitting down for the majority of the day - honest!

   I'll do a separate post on what I used to create the look, but you MUST
   know that [59]Revlon's Colorburst Matte Balm in Standout is literally
   my new staple lipstick. I chose red today simply because it's
   Valentine's Day and red lips look amazing.
   I hope you've enjoyed reading and don't forget to keep smiling and stay
   fabulous lovelies.

[77]Rock the Dress

   It's definitely the season where looking good in "Christmas photos" is
   at the forefront of our minds, and what better way to talk about it in
   relation to dressing your temporary figure? Now I'm aware that not
   everyone is on corticosteroids that temporarily blow you up - and yes
   it is temporary, you will slim down again - but everyone goes through a
   phase where your body is being unruly and weight loss isn't happening
   quick enough. Don't stress out over it, you'll reach your goals in due
   time.
   Everyone has an item (or 3) in their wardrobe that is their go-to
   outfit - mine were my Skinny Jeans. However, I got so bloated that I
   had to give them up for a while because they made me look bigger than I
   actually was. This can happen to anyone, but here's the cure...buy
   dresses that flatter your figure. "Why dresses?"...I'm glad you asked
   lovelies. Well, mainly because dresses don't have the tendency to cut
   you off like jeans do. There's no muffin top, or giving yourself
   third-degree burns because you have to tie the belt so tight. I'm
   telling you, dresses will rock your world! If you're worried that
   dresses won't suit you, they will, you just need to step out and own
   it. You're probably used to wearing Jeans or Trousers, but a dress is
   most definitely the answer to take you from feeling frumpy and lumpy to
   sassy and gorgeous!
   To kickstart the party season, try these 3 key styles that'll keep you
   looking fabulous darling!

The Simple Shift

   Shift Dresses suit most body shapes and sizes because their loose
   fitting design means it won't accentuate problem areas. Because of
   this, you won't have to shy away from prints or bold colours, be
   confident and try something different. I tend to find that some Shift
   Dresses fit better than others, in these instances, I tend to size up
   so that I feel comfortable. Pair with a Biker Jacket and boots for the
   day, and a blazer and heels for the evening. If you don't want to wear
   heels, wear some show-stopping flat shoes or boots - with tights, of
   course.

                              [83]Topshop - £45

The Sensational Skater

   Skater Dresses are a personal favourite of mine because they pull you
   in at the waist and flare out to a full skirt. To emphasise a narrow
   waist, place a skinny belt at the narrowest point, but don't tie it too
   tight...remember, we're avoiding third-degree burns. You can't go wrong
   with a Skater dress, you'll feel and look feminine and classy whenever
   you put this on. Wear with an oversized cardigan, Chelsea or distressed
   boots for a casual relaxed day look, and glam it up with a cropped
   blazer (so that the hem of the jacket sits perfectly over the flared
   skirt) and courts or shoeboots for a night out.

                           [89]River Island - £32

The Marvellous Midi

   The Midi Dress is the perfect solution when you want to throw on
   something that is simple but elegant. Midi refers to the length of the
   dress, but I'll be showing bodycon dresses as I can't get enough of
   them this season - it's a style that looks great on everyone. They come
   in petite too, so no one should feel excluded when purchasing. For a
   casual day look, wear with any comfortable flats - I love wearing them
   with my vans and a biker jacket. By night, team with high heels, a
   blazer and a statement necklace.

                   AX Paris Burgundy Snakeskin Midi Dress
                             [91]New Look - £25

                    [92][PAISLEY+TEXTURED+MIDI+DRESS.jpg]
                         Paisley Textured Midi Dress
                           [93]Miss Selfridge - £35

                [94][Dark+Red+Necklace+Trim+Midi+Dress2.jpg]
                      Dark Red Necklace Trim Midi Dress
                             [95]New Look - £22

   A word of advice, and no I'm not crazy...Try the dresses on in the shop
   and glam yourself up beforehand. I'm guilty of going into shops when I
   feel and sometimes look a mess. Believe me, it can cloud your judgement
   regarding a particular outfit. By doing this, the outfit will instantly
   look better on you because you've made an effort. It's not always easy
   to visualise how well you'll look if your appearance says something
   different. (I can't be the only one out there that's guilty of this,
   can I?)
   There are plenty of dresses out there that will help transform your
   mood as well as your image. Sometimes the right outfit is all you need
   to give your confidence a boost and take your mind off of weight
   problems and health issues. But keep this in mind, just because you may
   have piled on a few pounds doesn't mean your any less charming than
   when you were a little slimmer. Avoid wearing greys and blacks all the
   time and apologising for your larger frame to people who make comments
   about it. Work what you have and be the sassy, charming and beautiful
   person you always have been. Go on, swap your comfort pants for a
   beautiful dress and dazzle this season!
   Always remember to keep smiling and stay fabulous,
   Sam xx

[112]The Basics of Crohn's Disease

   Seeing as it's [113]National Invisible Chronic Illness Awareness Week I
   decided to write a post that explains the basics of Crohn's Disease. It
   used to amaze me that people know so little about the illness, but in
   reality, I knew nothing of it until I was diagnosed and Googled like
   there was no tomorrow. Now I consider myself an expert in terms of
   being a patient. If you've never heard of it before, brace yourself!
   For some reason I'm usually always asked, "What is Crohn's Disease?"
   over dinner or at a gathering, and in both settings the same effect
   takes place. *Cue silence* *all eyes on me* *sweaty palms and upper
   lip* Fortunately I've never been asked this over dessert, it would
   bring a whole new meaning to Chocolate Dessert wouldn't it? (The
   Chocolate/Poo Pie scene in "The Help" (2011) comes to mind). I'm
   probably still one of the most squeamish people I know, but educating
   you in this forum is so much easier than trying to explain it
   face-to-face. So to stop the awkward dinner questions, here goes...

Crohn's Disease - What is it anyway?

   Quite simply CD is a chronic (long-term) condition that causes swelling
   to the lining of the digestive system - that's anywhere from the mouth
   to the back passage. It can affect people of all ages, including
   children, but research suggests that most cases develop between the
   ages of 16-30. (I started experiencing symptoms at 16 years old).
   A large percentage of cases find that swelling mainly occurs in the
   last section of the small intestine (ileum) or the large intestine
   (colon). If you're wondering where it affects...so am I. Only joking,
   mine's in the colon.
   When the intestine becomes inflamed, the most common symptoms that can
   occur are:
     * Diarrhoea
     * Blood and mucus in your stools (poo)
     * Abdominal cramps - not the same as Period Pains at all
     * Fatigue
     * Weight loss

How did you get it?

   In most patients, the exact cause of CD is unknown, so I can never
   really answer this question. However researchers believe it is a
   combination of a few factors, but again, their suggestions can be
   problematic. See here for some of the [114]causes.

Treatment

   At present there is no cure for CD, but symptoms can be improved
   through treatment. This is usually in the form of Corticosteroids to
   reduce inflammation. (Yes these are the Steroids that fuelled my weight
   gain *straight face*) They also prescribe medication to suppress the
   immune system so that the intestines stop attacking itself. Because of
   this, the Flu Jab is usually recommended during this time as you're
   prone to getting "ill" quicker. That's right, the treatment causes more
   illnesses - welcome to my reality. Also, regular blood tests must be
   done to monitor the white blood cell count.
   It can take a long time before we're completely symptom free, but when
   we are, this is known as being in remission. However, that doesn't mean
   the symptoms won't flare up and become difficult to manage again. For a
   full list possible treatments, see the [115]NHS Website.
   In severe cases, some CD patients undergo surgery to remove the
   inflamed part of the diseased intestine and stitching the healthy
   sections back together. This is called a resection. Others undergo a
   procedure called an ileostomy, which redirects the digestive waste from
   the inflamed colon allowing it to heal. For more information on this
   procedure, read the NHS' introduction to the [116]Ileostomy.

What's next then?

   The Gastroenterologist - man I feel so smart typing that without error
   - or the gut specialist as I like to call them, will advise on the
   numerous options available. For every CD survivor, our main goal is
   maintaining remission. That means we want to live each day without
   being forced to take what feels like 101 tablets that leave an awful
   after taste. However, this doesn't mean we come off medication
   entirely. Some patients may choose to use natural products to help
   them, but as I've stressed before, no two cases are the same so that
   might not work for everyone. Either way, whatever path chosen, the
   patient will need to attend regular follow-up appointments. (Note to
   self, get blood test form and actually get the test done).
   Another way to maintain remission is through diet as some foods can
   aggravate the intestines. For me, too much Fruit, Veg and Whole Grains
   have me stuck to the loo. I actually like fruit and veg so it's a bit
   annoying, but I figured out a way to eat them without upsetting my
   stomach. I kept a food diary and worked out which items were fine and
   the ones to avoid like the plague (Cabbage and Pineapples are the
   worst).
   Finally, it is important not to get stressed as symptoms tend to worsen
   when a patient is under stress. You know what that means? Everyone
   *clears throat* back off...please because "I'm too blessed to be
   stressed." (I asked nicely!) Stress takes us back to the flare up stage
   and the treatment cycle begins again, just help us out by being nice. I
   understand everyone will face stress in life, but you have to find ways
   to eliminate stress so that it doesn't take it's toll on your body. Low
   intensity workouts like swimming or walking definitely helps, as does
   *cough* retail therapy - you're still walking aren't you?
   So for everyone who wasn't familiar with the weird and wonderful
   disease - cannot believe I just said that - I hope this gives more of
   an insight into what us Crohnies go through. Now when someone mentions
   they have it, or know someone with it, you won't need to ask them what
   it entails, you already know. It was much easier sharing it on here
   than I thought actually. Maybe I'm becoming less squeamish *checks
   mirror* Nope, I'm still blushing...never mind.
   Please share to help raise awareness of Crohn's disease and always
   remember to stay fabulous and keep smiling.

[134]Be Positive

   Yesterday was one of those days that had the potential to take me back
   to an extremely low place physically and psychologically. I had to
   leave work almost as soon as we opened so that I could get an emergency
   Doctor's appointment. I was experiencing the worst kind of stomach
   cramps; cramps so painful that stopped my speech mid-sentence. I’m used
   to just getting on with things, but this I couldn’t ignore, especially
   as I began to walk like a Penguin to try and ease the pain.

                     [135][BIGmumble+penguin+lbox.jpg]
                     I couldn't quite pull off his moves

   Surprisingly, I left my work place feeling calm while trying to be more
   Cara Delevingne, less Mumble (Happy Feet - penguin waddle). Normally I
   would've started to panic and run through every worst-case scenario it
   could possibly be. A flare up? Bowel Cancer? Will I need surgery to
   remove the diseased intestines? But I didn't this time; I simply
   decided to find out what was wrong. It's so easy to exacerbate every
   twinge we feel in our bodies because we're so used to bad news with
   Crohn's. Well let me tell you now, stop doing this, it's not healthy!
   We don't allow ourselves the chance to be told how it can be managed,
   we jump straight into "life is over" mode. If this is you right now,
   shake yourself - literally - and get a grip! *Shakes self*

                           [136][crohnies+4.jpg]
                    Couldn't have said it better myself.

   My Doctor confirmed that I'm not experiencing a flare up, it's simply a
   case of - forgive me for being so graphic - Piles (Haemorrhoids). (To
   find out more about them, if you dare, [137]click here). I was still in
   the "are you sure that's all it is?" mode, and looking into my Doctor's
   eyes to see if she was trying to hide bad news from me. But it turns
   out, that's what it was. Although it wasn't amazing news, to me, it was
   good news despite the pain. At that point I realised that my relaxed
   attitude helped me get through it - well that and the fact that I
   didn't need an internal examination! (Not a nice experience but has to
   be done now and again).

                            [138][crohnies1.jpg]
                                  So true!

   Today is a better day, and although I'm still in pain, my mindset
   doesn't tell me it's the end of the world. Don't get me wrong, pain is
   awful and right now, Buscopan (IBS relief) is my best friend, but I
   won't allow myself to stay down, and I won't allow you to either. If
   you need to cry, go ahead, I do and did when it was necessary - and
   sometimes when it wasn't necessary - but if it helps, let it out.
   There's nothing wrong with crying, you usually feel better afterwards
   too. Just don't let it consume you and become the only thing you do.

                            [139][crohns+5.jpg]
                 LOL - Crohn's humour that keeps me smiling!

   Why am I telling you about this? Because how you deal with bad news
   about your health - or anything else for that matter - today, tomorrow,
   or in the future determines how well you'll get through it all.  And
   no, crying doesn't mean you're weak and won't get through it, it just
   means you need to release some built up emotions. Perhaps Freud would
   call it the Weeping Cure? (I studied his work in Literature and
   Psychoanalysis, there's a name for everything). Freud might say that
   crying relieves the patient of "emotional sufferings". (Ok, I'll stop
   now - I clearly miss studying). But you see where I'm coming from, a
   certain amount of crying helps. The main thing is how you move forward.

                            [140][crohnie+3.jpg]
                        See the funny side of things.

   It's important not to over think a situation, let things happen without
   obsessing over what it may or may not turn out to be. I used to do
   that, and the only thing that came out of it was a guaranteed headache.
   I was feeling really rotten yesterday but told myself that I had to get
   out of bed and stop feeling sorry for myself, and it helped. I also put
   on Finding Nemo just so that I could hear Dory sing, "Just keep
   swimming". Call me childish, but I thought it was a great movie.
   [141][Keep+swimming.jpg]
   Just keep swimming!
   I guess when all is said and done the only person that has the power to
   change your thoughts is you. Don't stay stuck in a rut, get up, get out
   and do something different. If you want or need help there are plenty
   of people waiting to help you, all you need to do is ask. I'm one of
   them too, I talk a lot, but my name actually means "listener" so I'm
   here whenever you need me. If not, there are lots of places you can get
   support, the IBD Community is massive. Things will get better one day,
   just be patient and learn to smile through the hard times and talk to
   someone about how you're feeling. You matter, your feelings matter and
   you are important.
   I love you all so please remember to stay fabulous and keep smiling.
