[10]Devils preseason week one rundown

   Posted on [11]September 29, 2014 by [12]hasan4978

   The view from 209 at Barclays (from someone on HFBoards that was also
   in my section)

   With four games behind them and a good chunk of players who opened camp
   with the Devils already down at Albany or back in juniors, things are
   getting serious now for the 34 players who remain in camp hoping for
   one of 23 roster spots for the Devils’ season opener next Thursday.
   There still remain question marks at each position on the roster, which
   was part of the design of Lou Lamoriello’s attempt to inject
   competition in camp with a handful of veteran PTO’s and stockpiling
   kids who are ready and almost ready to make a contribution.

   In goal, Cory Schneider’s clearly the #1 guy but after four games
   there’s still some doubt as to who will be backing him up.  While
   37-year old Scott Clemmensen and 25-year old Keith Kinkaid are at
   different places in their careers, each is in a similar position on
   this roster, both with two-way contracts.  Each has also had a similar
   chance to audition, getting a game and a half with Kinkaid looking
   pretty decent (aside from one puckhandling snafu) against the Islanders
   at Barclays Center while Clemmensen looked shaky in his half game
   against the Rangers at MSG last Monday and wasn’t really tested all
   that much by the Flyers yesterday.  After previously stating that
   Schnieder would play in the final two games of the preseason to get
   ready for the regular season, coach Pete DeBoer seemed to be backing
   off that because of the backup goalie competition.  Personally I think
   they wanted Clemmensen to win the job – especially with him being
   waiver-eligible and Kinkaid not – but so far the youngster seems to
   have a leg up, hence the added evaluation.

   On defense things are shaping up with our ten defensemen remaining
   though Damon Severson’s still in camp, I still think he and fellow
   youngster Seth Hegelson are shaping up more as the first callups from
   Albany (Hegelson to add physicality, Severson to add skating ability
   and some offense).  Assuming neither make the team, it’s down to Tomas
   Kaberle and Peter Harrold for the #7 spot since Jon Merrill’s
   absolutely going to be on the roster and it’s not realistic to expect
   any of the other five signed defensemen to be waived.  Camp tryout Mike
   Komisarek was waived from his PTO after a couple of bad-nondescript
   games.  Honestly I’d rather see status quo for now here and Harrold
   remain the #7, since he’s more used to – and better at the ‘go in cold
   and play competent’ role of a seventh defenseman.  However, it is
   exciting to see the shift in the Devils’ defense that’ll take place in
   the next couple years and is already underway with Merrill, Adam
   Larsson and Eric Gelinas looking at key roles this year.

   Up front, twenty-one forwards still remain for fourteen spots.
   Although it’s more accurate to say that eleven forwards remain for four
   spots since the top nine seems set barring line changes (and Tuomo
   Ruutu’s going to make the team as well):

   Cammalleri-Zajac-Jagr, Havlat-Elias-Zubrus, Clowe-Henrique-Ryder

   Among those forwards, new acquisition Havlat and last season’s
   dissapointment Ryder look among the best players in camp this year,
   both of which are vital to our success offensively this year.  While
   barring a trade those ten forwards seem a certainty to be on the team
   to start the season, everyone else is on the border.  Going into camp,
   Steven Gionta, Steve Bernier, Jacob Josefson and Damien Brunner had an
   edge over the kids and camp invites, given the fact all are signed to
   one-way deals and Lou admitted last year he didn’t want to bury a
   contract in the minors.  However, something may have to give and soon.
    PTO’s Scott Gomez, Ruslan Fedotenko and Jordin Tootoo are still around
   (along with Ryan Carter, still in camp without a contract), as are
   youngsters Reid Boucher and Stefan Matteau.  Our eleventh forward is
   again Cam Janssen but it’s not likely he sniffs the roster coming out
   of camp.

   Of those on the outside looking in, Gomez and Boucher have by all
   accounts had the best camp.  Boucher seems almost ready to make a
   contribution in a top nine role but might be a victim of the numbers
   game early given the ability to send him down without losing him.
   Gomez – while he isn’t signed yet – is putting pressure on the team to
   make room for him after a two-goal game last night following a decent
   showing at Barclays Friday.  Of those on the inside looking behind
   them, only Brunner has really looked good from what I can tell.  Of
   course it’s only the staff’s opinion that’ll count in the end.

   At least I’ve been able to see an unusual amount of preseason – though
   I skipped the second game in Philly, which was on TV but sounded like a
   total no-show by the Devils who skated on Thursday.  I did get to see a
   good chunk of the preseason opener last Monday at MSG on the broadcast
   and made the trek to Brooklyn Friday to see the Barclays Center.  I
   have to admit the view was better than expected from section 209 though
   there are definitely areas elsewhere where the view’s less than
   spectacular.  And given the layout of the arena, when anyone stands up
   in any row in front of you it not only blocks a good chunk of the ice
   but can block the scoreboard as well.  Also the concourse in the upper
   level is really narrow at certain spots, and was problematic enough in
   a three-quarters fill stadium.  At least it’s not the dump Nassau is
   though and Barclays was surprisingly easy to get to from Penn Station
   (just a twenty-minute ride on the 2/3 downtown and you’re right in
   front of it).  Supposedly our own stadium’s going through some changes
   under new ownership as well that will be ready for October 18.  Just as
   well I won’t be there for any of the preseason games I guess, cause
   when I was there for Aerosmith earlier this month the Rock definitely
   looked like a work in progress.  As with the team itself, it’ll be nice
   to eventually see the finished product.

[15]Islanders Aim High In Final Year At Coliseum

   For over 40 years, the Islanders have called Nassau Coliseum home.
   Since entering the league in 1972, they have only known one arena. On
   Long Island in Nassau County that’s included a rich history featuring
   one of the NHL’s greatest dynasties. Built on the strength of Bill
   Torrey’s drafts that included Hall Of Famers Denis Potvin, Bryan
   Trottier, Mike Bossy and Billy Smith along with Clark Gillies, Ken
   Morrow, John Tonelli, Stefan Persson, Duane and Brent Sutter, they won
   four consecutive Stanley Cups from 1980-83. A trade for Bob Nystrom put
   them over the top. His overtime winner gave the Islanders their first
   Cup.

   Amazingly, this will be the final season at the Coliseum. Beginning in
   October 2015, they’ll relocate to Barclays Center in Brooklyn. It’ll be
   strange. For 42 years, the Islanders and Long Island have been family.
   In the future, those passionate fans that have supported them will have
   to take Mass Transit if they want to see their team. For now, they’ll
   savor one last year cheering their favorite players who don the
   trademark dark navy blue and bright orange jerseys.

   The current team is looking to move in the right direction. Led by
   captain John Tavares, they are a young group hoping to surprise their
   competitors in a tough Metropolitan Division. After losing Tavares to a
   torn MCL, they finished last with 79 points. A fully recovered Tavares
   should help. The core is built around the 24-year old franchise center
   who’ll team up with ’13-14 leading scorer Kyle Okposo to form a dynamic
   duo. Frans Nielsen provides them with a strong top three.

   General Manager Garth Snow inked Mikhail Grabovski and Nikolay Kulemin.
   The former Leafs played together and are being relied upon for
   secondary scoring. The Isles are also looking for improvement from Ryan
   Strome and Brock Nelson. Each enters their second year. Vets Josh
   Bailey and Michael Grabner must be more consistent. Both are capable of
   contributing but hit dry spells last year which really hurt the club.
   Anders Lee and Matt Martin are strong support players along with Cal
   Clutterbuck and Casey Cizikas. Snow also brought in Jack Skille and
   Cory Conacher to compete for spots.

   Snow’s biggest addition was Jaroslav Halak, who’ll be a huge upgrade in
   net. The 29-year old Slovak is capable of carrying a team. However,
   he’s never appeared in more than 57 games posting career bests in wins
   (27) and shutouts (7) with St. Louis in ’10-11. He’ll need to win
   30-or-more if the Isles are to challenge for the postseason. Chad
   Johnson was signed as a backup which is an improvement over Kevin
   Poulin. The Isles are banking on the new goalie tandem will keep them
   in more games.

   On the blueline, they’ll get back veteran Lubomir Visnovsky, who is
   returning after missing most of last season with a concussion. If
   healthy, he can aid their power play and log important minutes
   relieving pressure from Travis Hamonic. If there is an Achilles heel,
   it’s a young defense which heavily relies on Hamonic. The 24-year old
   is the glue that holds it together. He’ll need help from sophomore
   Calvin de Haan, who has the potential to be a shutdown D. A superb
   skater with good instincts, it appears the franchise’s patience might
   pay off. If his rookie year is any indication, the sky’s the limit.
   Vets Brian Strait and Thomas Hickey are solid but unsteady. As long as
   Visnovsky, Hamonic and de Haan can carry the load, that’ll allow coach
   Jack Capuano to limit their minutes. Matt Donovan and Kevin Czuczman
   could push for time.

   The club also has high hopes for prospects Griffin Reinhart and Ville
   Pokka. Both are only 20 with lots of potential. Unless either blows
   them away in camp, there’s no reason to rush. As long as they remain
   patient, they should continue to improve.

   It’s hard to predict how they’ll do. This is a team with some good
   talent. At the NHL level, they have a surplus at forward. The additions
   of Grabovski and Kulemin could make Bailey or Grabner expendable.
   Considering that Grabner is explosive shorthanded, I’d retain him and
   explore trading Bailey. The only problem is he’s signed for another
   three years at a cap hit of $3.3 million while Grabner’s contract
   expires after 2015-16. Depending on where they are in the standings,
   Snow could look to acquire a defenseman. We’ll have to wait and see.

   Of the three Battle Of New York clubs that comprise the metro area,
   they’re the team with the brightest future. However, it all hinges on
   Halak. Is he cut out for New York? Time shall tell.

[29]Stepan Injury No Reason To Panic Yet

   Posted on [30]September 24, 2014 by [31]Derek Felix

   [32]dd7c7-derekstepanhatty

   Injuries are part of sports. For the Rangers, they’ll have to deal with
   some adversity early. The team announced that Derek Stepan suffered a
   fractured left fibula. The injury was sustained during practice earlier
   today. The top center will be examined further to determine how long
   he’ll be out.

   Certainly, you don’t want to start a season without your number one
   center. That’s exactly what the Rangers have to do as they begin
   defense of an Eastern Conference title. Having bought out Brad Richards
   and lost Brian Boyle to free agency, center depth is a question
   entering 2014-15. Now, it becomes a bigger issue for at least the first
   month. Derick Brassard is supposed to center the second line. Instead,
   he’ll likely anchor the top unit unless coach Alain Vigneault decides
   to sub Dominic Moore for Stepan similar to last Spring.

   With competition for the third line between J.T. Miller, Matthew
   Lombardi, Oscar Lindberg, Kevin Hayes and Chris Mueller, Vigneault must
   determine who can help the team survive without Stepan. Depending on
   how long he’s out, it becomes imperative for whoever makes the club to
   be able to contribute. In their preseason home loss to the Devils
   Monday, Miller stood out setting up a pair of goals including a nice
   feed for a Ryan Malone power play goal. The 21-year old former 2011
   first round pick must continue to distinguish himself. If he does,
   perhaps he can be counted on more from a coach who questioned his
   professionalism last season.

   Assuming Miller makes it and there’s no reason to believe otherwise,
   that leaves four players for one center slot. Of the quartet, Lombardi
   is a proven NHLer who can center a bottom line. The 32-year old vet who
   signed this summer played last year in the Swiss League totaling 20
   goals and 50 points in 40 games. While he won’t be expected to produce
   much offensively, Lombardi is capable of contributing as long as he
   stays healthy. With Moore likely to move up, pencil Lombardi in on the
   fourth line. Unless Lindberg or Hayes impress, they’ll probably start
   in Hartford. While I’d love to see either force their way on, it’s
   probably best for development. That leaves Mueller as a potential
   extra.

   With Stepan going down, it’s easy to criticize general manager Glen
   Sather. Already we’ve seen the finger pointed at him for not signing
   Mike Ribeiro. You can’t look at it that way. Injuries happen. Based off
   one game, Tanner Glass at least gave us a glimmer of hope. He even
   helped set up Jesper Fast’s tying goal and killed penalties. While I’m
   no fan of him, you have to give Glass a chance. From a toughness
   standpoint, he can at least provide energy. There’s no guarantee he’ll
   play all 82. I wouldn’t expect it. You don’t have to dress him every
   night. Maybe a Fast or Ryan Bourque sneaks in.

   It would be easy to panic now that Stepan will miss time. I’m not ready
   to yet. This is an experienced team coming off a run to the Stanley Cup
   Final. There are plenty of holdovers who should provide leadership.
   Minus Stepan, over half the roster were part of that run which included
   a 3-1 second round comeback for the first time in franchise history.
   That includes Henrik Lundqvist, Ryan McDonagh, Dan Girardi, Marc Staal,
   John Moore, Kevin Klein, Brassard, Dominic Moore, Carl Hagelin, Rick
   Nash, Chris Kreider, Mats Zuccarello and Martin St. Louis. Miller, Fast
   and Cam Talbot were also part of it. That’s 16 players discounting
   Stepan who eventually will return. Don’t forget Dan Boyle is a proven
   vet who’ll help replace some of Richards’ leadership. That can’t be
   overlooked.

   When it comes down to it, there’s plenty of reasons to believe this
   team should be okay. Undoubtedly, they’ll miss Stepan’s play making and
   skill set. He is a superb passer who plays on the top power play unit.
   Brassard is a strong power play player who notched seven PPG’s and set
   up others last year. He had great chemistry with Zuccarello. With
   Benoit Pouliot gone, Nash could replace him allowing Kreider and St.
   Louis to play together on the first line. It’ll be up to Kreider, St.
   Louis, Nash and Zuccarello to produce. Don’t forget Hagelin, who had a
   good postseason tallying seven goals and 12 points. If vet Lee
   Stempniak can offset Pouliot, there should be enough scoring depth.

   It really becomes about how well Brassard plays in Stepan’s absence.
   He’ll need to be more consistent. A slow first half was followed by a
   strong second half in which his line became one Vigneault could count
   on. In the first year of a new deal that pays him $25 million over the
   next five years, it’s time for Brassard to reach the next level.
   There’s no reason he can’t produce between 50-60 points. The Blueshirts
   need him to.

   It could always be worse. Look no further than Carolina and Jordan
   Staal, who suffered a broken leg during their preseason game against
   Buffalo Tuesday night. He could be out a lot longer than Stepan. The
   point being that at least Stepan’s injury isn’t going to keep him out
   long-term. I’d rather the Rangers’ Iron Man get hurt now than during
   the season. He’ll be back. It’s important for the club not to rush him
   back. No matter what happens, they must be patient. Barring a horrible
   start, they’ll be fine.

[38]Still Without A Captain, Rangers Camp Opens

   Following a short summer, the Rangers opened up training camp today.
   They’re finally back after a great run to the Stanley Cup Final. Can
   they repeat last year’s success? That could depend upon how some of the
   new faces adjust.

   In a salary cap era, there will be casualties. Gone are Brad Richards,
   Anton Stralman, Brian Boyle, Benoit Pouliot, Derek Dorsett, Daniel
   Carcillo and Raphael Diaz. They’ve been replaced by Dan Boyle, Lee
   Stempniak, Tanner Glass, Ryan Malone, Matthew Lombardi and Chris
   Mueller. General Manager Glen Sather also added Michael Kostka, Steven
   Kampfer and Matt Hunwick to compete for seventh defenseman. Unless
   Conor Allen or Dylan McIlrath shine in camp, they’re likely ticketed
   for Hartford.

   One of the team’s biggest concerns is who will step up and replace
   Richards. Even though it was a no-brainer to buy him out freeing up
   necessary space to re-sign Derick Brassard, Mats Zuccarello, Chris
   Kreider and Dominic Moore, Richards’ leadership and production will be
   missed. His 20 goals and 51 points ranked in the top three in club
   scoring. His departure opens up competition at center. The leading
   candidates are J.T. Miller and Oscar Lindberg who’ll compete with
   Lombardi and Kevin Hayes. It’s a big year for Miller, who must prove he
   belongs. The competition should be fun to follow.

   Center remains a question mark. Derek Stepan is already the team’s
   number one pivot. He’ll look to build on a career best 57 point regular
   season that also included a new career postseason high 15 points
   (5-10-15). The 24-year old is someone to keep an eye on. He’ll need to
   become even more of a leader. There is even more pressure on Brassard,
   who’ll be asked to anchor the second line. In ’13-14, he centered the
   cohesive third line featuring Zuccarello and now departed Pouliot
   (signed with Edmonton). Their scoring proved pivotal during the
   postseason. Sather handed Brassard a five-year $25 million contract. A
   former Columbus first round pick who set personal bests in goals (18),
   power play goals (7) and game-winners (4), Brassard must perform more
   consistently. He’ll likely center Zuccarello and either Rick Nash or
   Carl Hagelin.

   One of the big story lines is who will become the next captain. After
   Slats dealt Ryan Callahan to Tampa Bay for Marty St. Louis, the team
   came together making their first Cup appearance since 1994. They
   rallied around the death of St. Louis’ Mom coming back from a 3-1
   deficit to stun Pittsburgh and then eliminated Montreal to become
   Eastern Conference champs. For most of the summer, it’s been felt that
   Ryan McDonagh will be named the 27th captain in franchise history. A
   story Daily News beat writer Pat Leonard went with last week. For now,
   Alain Vigneault won’t reveal the new captain until preseason concludes.
   I guess he prefers suspense.

   There aren’t as many questions with the defense. Sather opted to let
   Stralman walk to the Lightning, who apparently have become Rangers
   South also inking Brian Boyle and re-signing Callahan. Stralman was a
   solid defensive defenseman who worked well with Marc Staal. He was a
   strong puck possession player who rarely made mistakes. Rather than
   bring him back, Slats decided to address the power play by adding Dan
   Boyle for two years at a cap friendly hit of $4.5 million. The veteran
   is a proven power play quarterback who is still productive with six of
   his eight goals coming on the man-advantage last year in San Jose. At
   38, he can still log important minutes and should slide in with Staal.
   The only question is does his offense make up for a potential loss in
   defense. That’s what the Rangers are banking on. With John Moore
   re-upping last week for $850,500, he’ll team with Kevin Klein, who was
   steady after coming over from Nashville for Michael Del Zotto. Moore
   has potential but is still raw. His skating ability and shot are top
   notch. If he becomes more consistent, 25-30 points is possible.

   As far as the top pair, there aren’t many better than McDonagh and Dan
   Girardi. Mac Truck flourished in the playoffs pacing the team in
   scoring with 17 points while dominating defensively. His elder partner
   Girardi rebounded from a bad first half eventually re-signing for six
   years at an average of $5.5 million per year. While he struggled badly
   against the Kings, Girardi remains the heart and soul sacrificing his
   body for the team any way possible. You just hope that risky style
   doesn’t come back to bite him halfway through that contract.

   The only other question is Staal, who enters the final year of his
   contract that sees him earn a modest $3.975 million. A popular team
   leader who has overcome serious injuries, Staal hinted that he wants to
   stay. Similar to Henrik Lundqvist, he’d like to get a new deal done as
   soon as possible. With rumors that it could take six years at at least
   $6 million, it remains to be seen if it’ll get done. While I value
   Staal, who’s the second best defenseman behind McDonagh, I wonder if we
   haven’t already seen the best of him. However, with prices for
   defensive D-men on the rise, his salary demands aren’t out of whack. If
   he ever does reach next summer, teams might be willing to pay top
   dollar.

   It’s an interesting dilemma for Sather, who also must lock up Stepan,
   extend Hagelin and worry about Zuccarello and valuable backup Cam
   Talbot. I’m not advocating getting rid of Staal. However, if he doesn’t
   improve from last year and his demands are too high given the risk he
   could be, maybe they’re better off trading him. Right now, I’d rather
   not think about that. You can’t break up the defense right now. Along
   with Lundqvist, it’s the strongest part of the team. I’m not
   comfortable with Klein in the top four. He and Moore are a good fit on
   that third pair. Let’s just wait and see.

   Goaltending has never been stronger with Lundqvist carrying his team as
   far as he could humanly take them. Heroic is the best way to describe
   King Henrik’s 2014 postseason. After clearly being affected by having
   no contract, he showed great mental strength turning it around once
   Sather re-signed him. There’s not a more admirable athlete in the metro
   area once Derek Jeter retires. Lundqvist will do anything to win and
   often does when his team doesn’t supply offense. Here’s hoping Rick
   Nash remembers what he’s paid for. Even better, Lundqvist can get
   nights off thanks to Cam Talbot, who came out of nowhere to win 12
   games with three shutouts while posting a 1.64 goals-against-average
   and .941 save percentage. If 33 wins, a 2.36 GAA, .920 save percentage
   and five shutouts is an “off year,” just wait to see what Lundqvist
   comes back with.

   Even without Richards, Boyle, Pouliot, Stralman, Dorsett and Carcillo,
   this remains a good team that is capable of challenging for first in
   the Metropolitan Division. Much depends on how some of the replacements
   do. Don’t forget they get a full season of Marty St. Louis which should
   only help. You have to like a potential top line of Kreider or Nash
   with Stepan and St. Louis. I don’t think you can have St. Louis and
   Zuccarello together the same way I believe splitting up Nash and
   Kreider provides more balance to the top two units.

   I’m most curious to see who emerges in camp. Don’t forget Ryan
   Haggerty, who had an impressive Traverse City pacing our prospects with
   three goals. He’s a right-handed shot which is something the club
   lacks. While it’s still a long shot for him to make it due to stiff
   competition coming from Miller, Malone, Lindberg, Hayes, Ryan Bourque,
   Danny Kristo, I’m curious to see how he looks. I’m also pulling for
   Bourque, who has been written off due to his smallish 5-9, 185-pound
   frame. He had his best pro season with Hartford. I still feel he could
   surprise and become a fourth line/penalty kill specialist.

   With camp tests running today and Friday followed by Monday’s first
   preseason game at home against the Devils on MSG, hockey is finally
   back. It’s about time.

[51]Devils camp opens without contreversy, but plenty of intrigue

   Posted on [52]September 18, 2014 by [53]hasan4978
   [54]Martin Brodeur leaving the ice possibly for the last time

   Martin Brodeur leaving the ice possibly for the last time

   In too many recent seasons, the Devils have entered camp with an
   overriding question or contreversy that needed to be addressed.  In
   2010, it was the cap/roster issues due to the monster Ilya Kovalchuk
   contract that led to the team having short rosters early in the season
   and an unhappy captain refusing to waive a no-trade until the season
   was completely in the tank (Jamie Langenbrunner).  The next season it
   was Zach Parise’s impending UFA status and ownership financial problems
   that hung over the team like the sword of Damocles even as the
   Devils made a Cinderella run to the Stanley Cup Finals.  In 2012, the
   team had to replace one-and-done captain Parise and his 30+ goal, 70+
   point production on the heels of a lockout, and also had to drag an
   unhappy Kovalchuk back from Russia.  Last year, there was the matter of
   replacing Kovalchuk who decided to stay in Russia permanently this
   time, as well as deal with a goaltending contreversy between draft day
   acquisition Cory Schnieder and franchise legend Martin Brodeur.

   This season?  To be sure there are question marks and storylines…for
   one Brodeur’s not here for the first time in two decades (though still
   on the market as a UFA, now officially in career limbo), while
   Schnieder’s fully entrenched as the goaltender-in-chief with a new
   six-year extension.  Another former team legend that isn’t here is
   Scott Stevens, who left the coaching staff a few days before the
   season, following two seasons as an assistant on Pete DeBoer’s staff
   and several others as a special assistant.  Personal and professional
   reasons were the official reason given for Stevens’ departure, though
   NJ.com’s Rich Chere wrote – via ‘several sources’ – that Stevens didn’t
   feel like he had enough input in decision-making.  Whatever the reason,
   the organization announced that Tommy Albelin would make the jump from
   the Albany staff to replace Stevens, which might actually work out well
   considering Albelin’s worked extensively with all of the young
   defensemen that are going to be counted on to be in the lineup this
   season.

   Still even Brodeur and Stevens’ departures (notwithstanding the
   presence of Anthony Brodeur in camp) pale in comparison to the issues
   of recent seasons past.  There are still plenty of question marks, to
   be sure – as there is with just about any team coming into camp – but
   at least this time around it doesn’t feel like there’s a reaper just
   around the corner.  With Schnieder and blueline stalwart Andy Greene
   signed to long-term deals in the offseason, the Devils can at least
   continue to budget for additions to the team as opposed to merely
   trying to prevent more departures…and with new ownership in its second
   season, there will at least be more money to spend than there was a few
   years back.  Also after two seasons of contreversy and an overcrowded
   defense, finally the shift towards having a younger defense and a more
   set lineup got put in motion with the buyout of Anton Volchenkov and
   the FA departure of solid but not spectacular Mark Fayne.  Veterans
   Andy Greene, Marek Zidlicky and Bryce Salvador will complement
   youngsters Adam Larsson, Jon Merrill and Eric Gelinas with Peter
   Harrold a solid #7 fillin.

   Thankfully Gelinas signed earlier this week to eschew the possibility
   of a camp holdout, which seemed kind of likely once infamous agent
   Gilles Lupien started making very personal comments about GM Lou
   Lamoriello (not surprpising though given their history, considering it
   was Lupien who was famously fired by Brodeur when the goalie decided to
   come to his own deal with Lou to end a contract stalemate in the late
   ’90’s).  Even with the defense apparently set however, there’s still a
   little intrigue with camp tryouts Tomas Kaberle and Mike Komisarek, as
   well as KHL veteran Renat Mamashev.  It’s pretty unlikely that any of
   them beat out the kids for a spot – Larsson and Gelinas are
   waiver-eligible and would never get down to the AHL anyway, while
   Merrill was too good last year to even consider having him start the
   season in Albany – but one could possibly beat out Harrold for the #7
   defense spot I suppose, or be on standby in case someone gets hurt in
   camp.

   Likewise our forward lineup seems set or close to it with fourteen guys
   signed on one-way contracts plus fan favorite Ryan Carter, who’s
   attending camp without a contract but probably will be signed at some
   point.  Yet there are some intriguing camp bodies that could further
   cloud the forward picture with scoring winger Reid Boucher and former
   first-rounder Stefan Matteau the biggest names among our prospect base
   and the most likely to make an impact in 2014-15.  Both will likely
   start in Albany this year barring injuries and/or trades though.  Also
   in camp are some vet tryouts up front, including feisty Jordin Tootoo
   and scoring vagabond Ruslan Fedotenko, who seems to want to complete a
   tour of the locals after being with the Rangers and Flyers the last
   couple years.

   Of course the biggest name among our camp invites is the most
   familiar/notorious to Devil fans – Scott Gomez, who was a key figure on
   our team during our most dominant stretch (2000-2003) where we won two
   Cups and three Wales Conference bowls during a four-year period.  Gomez
   had his best season in 2005-06 with 33 goals and 84 points.  However,
   Gomez soon became blacklisted among Devil fans after he made the jump
   to the rival Rangers during the summer of 2007, and his career fell on
   hard times from 2010 on after being traded to Montreal – also playing
   in San Jose and Florida the last couple of seasons after being bought
   out by the Canadiens.  Perhaps it’s telling Gomez got the number 28 (FA
   signee Mike Cammalleri’s wearing Gomez’s old #23), while all of the
   other vet invites got high numbers.  Usually lower numbers = more of a
   chance to make the team.  Gomez making the team would probably be bad
   news for the ill-fated Jacob Josefson whose career’s been plagued by
   injuries and benchings – though the former first-rounder signed a
   two-year deal in the offseason – still, if Gomez somehow turns back the
   clock a bit a la Petr Sykora a couple years back, he could easily
   outperform Josefson and win a job.  There’s also the possibility Gomez
   is just insurance in case the fragile Swede winds up on IR again during
   camp.

   While I really want to see Josefson get a chance and finally make the
   most of it this year, part of me is hoping Gomez lasts at least till
   our preseason home games to see both his public pandering to the fans
   and the fans’ reaction since the booing never really abated even after
   Gomez’s career cratered.  Oh well, what would Devils camp be without at
   least one or two returning former players – the other returnee this
   year being goaltender Scott Clemmensen, who’s competing with young
   Keith Kinkaid for the role of backing up Schnieder this year.
   Clemmensen has been remembered much more fondly by the fans since
   leaving thanks to his Cinderella 25-win season in 2009 that saved our
   bacon when Brodeur was on IR for four months.  Still, after a bad
   couple of seasons in Florida it’s far more likely he begins the season
   in Albany if Kinkaid outperforms him in camp.  That competition will
   certainly be an intriguing thing to watch.

   Competition seems to be the new buzzword around camp in fact.  Even
   though most of the roster would appear to be set at the present time,
   there’s definite competition for forward spots among young and old
   players (most on short or no contracts), for places in the defensive
   pecking order among the younger players – including Damon Severson who
   might potentially be this season’s Merrill and make an impact out of
   nowhere – and competition for the #2 goaltending spot.  All of this is
   a good thing by the way…for all of my issues with how the defense was
   handled the last couple years, I’ve never been against competition,
   especially on a team that’s missed the playoffs the last couple years.
    What happened on defense those two years didn’t help matters however,
   and seemed more like a rotation and exercise of roster convenience than
   an actual competition.  On the other hand, loading up on forwards to
   start camp this year is not exactly a bad strategy, given the number of
   older/injury-prone guys we have up front.

   While there are certainly question marks around the Devils and how good
   they can be this year (and I’ll be commenting on them through camp), at
   least camp will be intriguing to watch without many of the worries
   during recent seasons.  Here’s a numerical/positional roster of
   everyone in Devils camp this year:

[61]Viewers Get Shut Out By Traverse City

   Every September, hockey fans get excited for its return. Not only do we
   get to see our teams and favorite players come back but we also get a
   chance to follow prospects. Whether it be during training camp,
   preseason or in specialized prospect tournaments, it’s nice to see who
   stands out. Unfortunately, for those who don’t live in Traverse City or
   are media credentialed, you have no way of keeping track.

   Not long ago, NHL Network televised games in Traverse City. However,
   times have changed and not for the better. For whatever reason, they’d
   rather air playoff repeats than give starved fans what they want. It’s
   no secret I’m not fond of NHL Network or NBC Sports Network (NBCSN).
   I’ve always felt both league partners could do better to promote the
   game. While it’s not all negative during the season with NHL Network
   airing AHL and prospect games while NBCSN shows college hockey, there’s
   still collective disappointment that fans don’t get to see any coverage
   of Traverse City or a host of other tournaments featuring former top
   picks. Unless you live in Canada, you’re shut out.

   By show of hands, who thinks the NHL can do a better job? This isn’t to
   ignore loyal reporters who at least give us something. When you are
   left empty handed after failing to find a decent site that has a
   boxscore, it’s sad on so many levels. In today’s world of social media,
   it doesn’t make any sense. Sure. You can follow Corey Pronman on
   Twitter and at least read some of his tweets. Unless you’re an ESPN
   Insider, you’re not getting much information. It makes blogging about
   it useless.

   Today is the final day of Traverse City, who are in their 16th year.
   Throw your hands up in the air. Hooray for not giving us anything.
   Shame on everyone involved. Thanks for nothing!

[73]Devils Re-sign Eric Gelinas

   Posted on [74]September 15, 2014 by [75]Derek Felix

   After a long wait, the Devils finally re-signed Eric Gelinas. The
   23-year old offensive defenseman posted seven goals and 22 assists for
   29 points in 60 games last season. Despite some defensive deficiencies
   which limited ice-time, Gelinas was productive. His 29 points ranked
   third among New Jersey blueliners. Five of his seven markers came on
   the power play.

   Gelinas gets a one-year deal worth a reported $900,000. Along with Andy
   Greene, Marek Zidlicky, Bryce Salvador and Jon Merrill, Gelinas will be
   in competition with Adam Larsson and veteran Peter Harrold for the
   final spot. Given his offensive capabilities, he remains a strong
   candidate to man the Devils power play. With Zidlicky quarterbacking
   the first unit, Gelinas could slot in on either unit. Boasting a
   cannon, his offense is valuable. Much will depend on how much he
   improves in his end.

     “Just happy to have everybody here, everybody ready,” Devils general
     manager Lou Lamoriello said. “It’s the first step towards getting
     our team together. We’ve got all our players here and now training
     camp begins.”

   The Devils have also invited vets Tomas Kaberle and Mike Komisarek to
   camp. They’ll also take another look at top prospect Damon Severson,
   who posted 15 goals and 61 points for the Kelowna Rockets of the
   Western Hockey League. Only 20, the 2012 second round pick is on the
   fast track. But with New Jersey boasting a lot of depth, there’s no
   need to rush him.
