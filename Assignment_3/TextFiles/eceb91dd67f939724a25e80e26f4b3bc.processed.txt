[82]This Is All Yours (CD)

[83]Alt-J

          With a sophomore record, there tends to be quite a bit at stake.
          All too often an act tries in vain to access the same immediacy
          and power that they were able to flaunt in their first release.
          Not to mention how much time and energy a band has had to craft
          their first etchings into popular consciousness. A second record
          is somewhat of a second chance these days to prove that you can
          still do that thing people liked, or at least fake it. English
          Indie rockers Alt-J are clearly an exception. Their second
          effort,  This Is All Yours , is an example of a band using their
          second chance as a “give ‘em an inch, take a mile” credo. Coming
          off the commercial success of  An Awesome Wave  the now trio is
          taking some chances with their already defined sound.  This Is
          All Yours  blends similar electronics and harmonies from the
          first record with sound collage ("Every Other Freckle"), folk
          ballads ("Choice Kingdom"), so-cal funk ("Left Hand Free"), and
          even a Miley Cyrus Sample ("Hunger of the Pine"). An Innovative
          leap from a band that otherwise could have left well alone.

[87]Tribal (CD)

[88]Imelda May

          The overall brassiness of rockabilly lends itself very well to
          Dublin’s Imelda May. It is always a dicey proposition to attempt
          to reclaim a genre of a bygone era. Luckily Imelda May seems to
          have good intentions. Well, maybe not good intentions…but this
          is no cheesy throwback or retro cash grab. On her fourth
          record,  Tribal , May seems to have perfected her blend of
          contemporary rockabilly, new wave and straight-ahead bad-ass
          pop. The dozen tunes written by May and her husband (and
          guitarist) Darrel Higman swing from genre to genre with ease.
          From the high octane "Tribal" to the dreamy '50s malt shop
          inspired "Little Pixie" to the downright sleazy blues of "Wicked
          Way," this effortless cohesion is maintained solely by Imelda’s
          rockabilly sensibilities. All of which leads the listener to get
          a sense of the importance of the tribe to which she is
          referring.

[91]Human Voice (CD)

[92]Dntel

          Dntel, solo producer by the name of Jimmy Tamborello has long
          been creating soundscapes for others to put their human voice
          over. With  Human Voice  Tamborello has refused listeners the
          rights to their own language. Instead, he has created a world
          where connection is fleeting, melody is deconstructed, and all
          “voices” mechanized. An interesting proposition when the bulk of
          your listeners associate your music with Death Cab For Cutie’s
          emotive crooner Ben Gibbard. Nevertheless, the gambit pays off.
          Amidst the bits and grids of  Human Voice , the mechanized
          voices morph through layered synths and staccato beats from the
          unintelligible to a distinct melodic pattern and back again.
          After 8 tracks It gives the listener the feeling of having
          communicated with a being not unlike a robot Ben Gibbard.

[96]Syro (CD)

[97]Aphex Twin

          In a rare double-blessing, the last two years have given us not
          only a new album by My Bloody Valentine but another artist
          iconic of the ’90s, Aphex Twin.  Syro  plays as a collection of
          just about everything Richard Davis James does best, fusing
          jungle beats to gorgeous ambient tapestries on stunning opener
          “Minipops 67 [120.2][Source Field Mix],” taking us through dense
          synth explorations on tracks like the 10-minute “Xmas_Evet10
          [120][Thanaton3 Mix]” and vibing off hip-hop and synth funk on
          “Produk 29 [101].” Vocals appear now and then (from James and
          his family), offering skewed, incomprehensible chatter that adds
          to the liveliness of “Produk 29 [101]” and giving “Minipops 67
          [120.2][Source Field Mix]” its grabbing human element, pulling
          you into the rest of the album. Though he used some 138 pieces
          of equipment and shifted his set up every few minutes while
          recording  Syro,  that seems to have had an energizing effect on
          James, and the result is a sharp, if varied piece of work that
          hangs together beautifully, flowing from scenic but heady pieces
          like “4 Bit 9d Api+E+6 [126.26]” to hard-hitting bass tracks
          such as “180db_ [130].” There aren’t many shocking moments on
          Syro  like, say, “Come to Daddy’s” shrieking wail, nor does it
          push listeners to their extreme limit like the challenging
          Drukqs  did, but accessibility doesn’t mar  Syro . Rather, even
          despite their straight-off-the-hard-drive titles, tracks like
          “Papat4 [155][Pineal Mix]” are really breathtaking pieces of
          music, designed for immersion rather than to filter listeners
          out. Just like  m b v , we had no right to expect  Syro  would
          be this good, much less that it would be released at all, which
          makes it all the better. Simply put, it’s one of the most
          instantly enjoyable collections of music James has ever
          released.

[107]Commune (CD)

[108]Goat

          The second studio record by this Swedish based Avant-Collective
          whose cult-like presence and mysticism indicate that the band
          has been operating in a far off land for the last 30 to 40
          years. Their first album,  World Music , filled with fiery jams
          and afro dance grooves, seemed to journey through space and
          time, sending the listener traveling the vistas of the world in
          the acid wash past of the '60s.  Commune ,   by comparison,
          transcends space and time. The opening tribal gongs of "Talk To
          God" create a sense of some sacred initiation. As the gong fades
          the eastern guitars and hypnotic percussion tumble you forward.
          It isn’t until the jarring gnarl of the other worldly chant hits
          your bones that you notice you are part of the ceremony.
          Meditative pace lulls you into a thirty minute hazy trance. All
          at once, swept up in the dance, you conjure memories of icy
          Swedish witch burning ceremonies. Your primal communing of all
          other beings talking to god. Your God. You chant “INTO THE FIRE!
          INTO THE FIRE!” A gong rings. The memory fades. You have been
          converted.

[112]Too Bright (CD)

[113]Perfume Genius

          Aptly named third album from Seattle based Mike Hadreas. With
          his previous output Hadreas had depended heavily on his lyrical
          prowess to shine through his sparse piano compositions. With
          tracks like “Queen” and “My Body” the lyrical dependence of
          dealing with his place in society as a gay man remains, but the
          self-effacing and fearful panic is barely contained. Instead, it
          is let out in focused evanescent bursts. Aided by the production
          of Portishead’s Adrian Utley,  Too Bright  is a perfect example
          of an artist catching up with his thoughts and being able to
          express his deeper feelings through his craft.

[120]Black Moon Spell (CD)

[121]King Tuff

          When King Tuff released his breakthrough self-titled album in
          2012, he came off as a successor to T. Rex’s Marc Bolan, alone
          and stoned in his room and writing perfect power-pop gems. But
          like Bolan before him, who started with a few English folk
          albums before going glam, King Tuff aka Kyle Thomas seems to
          have set his sights higher this time around, filling out the
          sound with full-bodied heavy rock riffs and pushing his nasal
          wail into a wolf’s howl. Like  King Tuff ’s “Anthem,” “Black
          Moon Spell’s” big fat riff sounds pulled out from the ether,
          like it was always there, judging by the way it nestles into
          your skull. “Rainbow’s Run” calls to mind another garage-rock
          luminary, Ty Segall, in the way it takes a simple glam structure
          and pours acid all over it, impossible distortion and flailing
          solos flying off the edges. Though there’s a winking hair-metal
          touch to  Black Moon Spell , songs like “Headbanger” (complete
          with demonic opening) don’t stray so far from the glam-garage
          foundation that it’s jarring—and Thomas’ voice is too cartoonish
          and the songs are too damn catchy to really scare off any garage
          kids, anyway. Even a song called “Demon From Hell” is more fey
          and punk than hellish, despite pushing the sound into the red.
          If there’s one thing  Black Moon Spell  is, it’s a great guitar
          album, as songs like “Eyes of the Muse” prove, starting with a
          ’70s AM radio gold jangle and moving into psychedelic, searching
          riffs, while Bobby Harlow’s production practically places the
          drums in your living room. There hasn’t been a better album
          released this year to play air guitar and drums to than  Black
          Moon Spell .

[129]Chinese Fountain (CD)

[130]The Growlers

          The Growlers had previously announced their fourth album would
          be “more grown up, well polished.” Would our rabble-rousing O.C.
          kids who were  Hung at Heart  on their last album ditch the
          garage for something  mature ? The answer is a half-yes. On
          Chinese Fountain , the band successfully adds new elements to
          their sound while retaining their core garage-rock appeal. After
          throwing their fans a few bones with the saloon jangle of “Big
          Toe” and heartbreak rock of “Black Memories,” the title track
          introduces swirling synths and funk guitars to the mix, a bid at
          stadium rock ‘n’ roll although still with a nice grit to it and
          non sequiturs about our retro-obsessed yet technologically
          saturated society (“even disco seems pop”; “every little kid
          wants a computer in his pocket”; “the Internet gets bigger than
          Jesus and John Lennon”). These prove welcome additions to their
          sound, as the band gives a light reggae touch to “Dull Boy” and
          makes nods to ’80s bands like Blondie, The Cure and the Pixies
          (on the surging “Good Advice”). Brooks Nielsen’s vocals and
          lyrics, in particular, feel improved, as Nielsen proves he has
          more to say than the average SoCal garage dude—“that ain’t a
          home; it’s a furnace in need of some matches” he sings weerily
          on “Magnificent Sadness,” while “Good Advice” suggests, “there’s
          nothing as depressing as good advice, nobody wants to hear how
          to live their life.” It may not be quite as cohesive as some of
          their other work, but  Chinese Fountain  finds the band in top
          form, nonetheless. Maybe maturity ain’t such a bad thing after
          all.

[137]Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band [Mono] (LP)

[138]The Beatles

          The Beatles weren't the only band to record a legendary
          psychedelic album in 1967. They weren't even the only ones at
          Abbey Road Studios. However, they were the best. With the help
          of producer George Martin, the Beatles used or invented every
          studio trick available to create arguably the most original and
          otherworldly sounding album of all time. Between the opening
          murmurs of the anticipating crowd on the title track and the
          spliced tape groove at the end lies a lesson in modern music.
          The Beatles sonic scope expands and contracts effortlessly with
          horns, harps, orchestras and even a rooster weaving a web of
          daringly original music. The album oozes highlights. In
          particular, the question and answer "With A Little Help From My
          Friends," the hallucinatory "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds," the
          suggestive "Lovely Rita," the circus fantasy "Being For The
          Benefit of Mr. Kite!" and the gleefully optimistic "Getting
          Better" are all masterfully guided by Paul's incredible bass
          work. The sudden, empty-nest sadness of "She's Leaving Home" is
          heartbreaking. The swirling meditation of "Within You Without
          You" is transcendent. The man on the scene "Good Morning Good
          Morning" is vibrant and energizing.  Sgt. Pepper  majestically
          concludes with one of the last true Lennon/McCartney
          collaborations, the sprawling genre defying epic "A Day In The
          Life." Words can't do the album justice. Find out for yourself.

[141]Singles (CD)

[142]Future Islands

          It’s a gutsy move to call your album  Singles , but in the case
          of Future Islands, their fourth album and first for 4AD, it’s
          appropriate. The album is packed with songs that are both
          immaculately written and catchy as hell, as Future Islands mine
          new wave and pop-rock for all they’re worth. Just as lead singer
          Samuel Herring’s dynamite performance style and swingin’ dance
          moves have won people over (David Letterman, famously), the band
          gives it their all on songs like “Seasons (Waiting On You).”
          Herring’s emotional, throaty tenor, which can warp into a growl
          in an instant, is given the perfect backdrop of stargazing
          new-wave rock that should bring together fans of everyone from
          Bruce Springsteen to The Cure to The Killers with lighter-waving
          glee. The synths of “Spirit” bring up memories of B-Movies
          “Nowhere Girl,” but Herring’s unique voice keep Future Islands
          from ever veering into purely nostalgic territory. “A Song For
          Our Grandfathers” is dreamy yet packs an emotional punch.
          Herring seems to get more and more insistent over the sprightly
          “Light House,” almost completely out of step with the band, yet
          it works so much better than it would have if he played it
          straight, getting in your face and making it impossible to
          merely have the song on in the background. On “Like the Moon,” a
          sexy, pulsating groove gives Herring the chance to kill it
          vocally, crooning romantically. But his best vocal performance
          comes next, on “Fall From Grace”—over a simple waltz, Herring
          goes deep into the bowels of his voice to deliver a performance
          somewhere between Tom Waits, The National’s Matt Berniger and a
          black metal singer. Charisma like his doesn’t come around all
          the time, and as a band, Future Islands are smart enough to stay
          out of the way while crafting terrific songs that stand on their
          own. Before you know it, you’ve listened to  Singles  like five
          times and still can’t wait to hear it again.
