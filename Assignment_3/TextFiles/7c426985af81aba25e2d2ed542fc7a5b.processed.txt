Turning 60

   Thoughts on aging.

[6]Mrs. Duggins

   Grace Duggins was a feisty old lady. I was kind of scared of her. She
   was a friend of my dad and step-mother. A widow, she lived alone. Her
   only child, a son named Bernard, lived in Hong Kong. Grace (I would
   never have called her that back then) taught piano lessons out of her
   home. She much preferred teaching boys as she said girls were just too
   silly. I was a teenager when I met her. She fascinated me. She was
   independent and out spoken. If she thought you were full of poppy cock,
   she didn't mince words telling you so. I remember thinking how cool it
   was that she seemed perfectly fine without a man. As a young teenage
   girl, all I could think about was getting one. After Kenny and I got
   married, Mrs. Duggins gave me a black half-slip. I can't remember why
   she did it. Perhaps I mentioned needing one. More likely, she caught a
   glimpse of my legs through my skirt when I was wandering around without
   a slip. That wouldn't do at all; so she presented me with the slip. Now
   if you ever want someone to think about you, give them something they
   will wear often. Every time I put on that slip, I thought of her. She
   lived on her own well into her 90's and drove herself out to a country
   church to play the piano. Although she is gone now, I still have her
   gift  in my lingerie drawer.

[10]People are Like Windows

   People are like windows, I've noticed over the years.
   [11][tall+and+thin.jpg]
   Some are tall and thin.
   [12][short+and+fat.jpg]
   Some are short and fat.
   [13][open+wide.jpg]
   Some are open, wide and inviting.
   [14][closed+tight.jpg]
   Some are closed tight and say, "Go Away."
   [15][plain+and+simple.jpg]
   Some are plain and simple, in fact, very ordinary.
   [16][quite+fancy.jpg]
   Others are quite fancy.
   [17][dirty.jpg]
   Some are so dirty their usefulness is hindered.
   [18][bright.jpg]
   Some are bright and shinning.
   [19][broken.jpg]
   Some are broken, their purpose wasted.
   [20][so+lovely.jpg]
   Others are so lovely, they are a sight to behold.
   What kind of window are you?

[24]If Looks Could Kill

   Have you ever heard the expression, "If Looks Could Kill, I'd be
   Dead."? That thought occurred to me the other day when I caught a good
   look at myself in the mirror. Now, I wasn't looking evil or anything.
   But, where did the young lady go that used to get wolf whistles as she
   walked down the street? The sagging jowls and wrinkles on the upper
   lips didn't just appear overnight. How is it that I just now noticed?
   One thing is certain, I do not have the money to change my outward
   appearance. I don't blame the aging starlets who spend fortunes on
   botox injections and laser treatments. Cosmetic surgery is a booming
   business. Maybe I would do it if I had the money. But, I don't think
   I'll ever have the option. I'd like to believe that if I ever came into
   a fortune, I'd have the good sense to use it to help other people
   instead of indulging my vanity. When I was a young child, my grandma
   would get me all dressed up and then tell me, "Now Patty, if you only
   act as nice as you look, you will do fine." She was trying in her way
   to tell me that my inner beauty, reflected in how I treated others, was
   far more important that outward loveliness. So Grandma, that is what I
   will continue to work on. It doesn't cost a penny to enhance one's
   inner beauty. Each day, I will try to choose the beautiful way to
   behave. Knowing my character flaws, that will be quite a project. If I
   can avoid the snide response, or keep myself from yelling at the idiot
   driver who just cut me off, then I will be working on my inner
   beautification project. If I can keep from talking about myself and
   instead focus on others, I will be showing them attention in a
   meaningful way. Does this make sense to you? Yes, I'll still comb my
   hair and put on lipstick. But, I will also put on a cloak of kindness
   so that I can treat others the way I would like to be treated. Just
   like my grandma taught me.

[28]Medicare

   I got my Medicare card recently and promptly took it to the bank and
   had it laminated. I want it to last a long time because I plan to as
   well. I started this blog when I was nearing 60, trying to wrap my head
   around what that meant. I didn't feel old then and I don't feel old
   now. Not really sure if I even understand what feeling old means. When
   I was much younger, I thought anyone over thirty was old. Poof! I was
   thirty and found out that it wasn't true at all. I hear people talk
   about being old. Some have called me old on Twitter and at home. I even
   called myself old on one of these blog posts because I needed another
   word to describe myself. I am not going to do that anymore. I work hard
   every day to stay young. I workout and line dance and take swim
   aerobics classes. I am not going to turn into an old fuddy, duddy. I
   want to learn new things and stay involved with people. I love
   technology and embrace change. So, I proudly march forward towards 70
   and wonder what the next age will bring my way.

[32]An Old White Lady's Thoughts on Race

   My first memory of any recognition of race was the day I brought my new
   friend home for lunch. My grandma must have been watching us come up
   the steps because she met us at the door and said it wasn't convenient
   to have guests for lunch. She sent my new friend packing and then set
   me down and told me to never do that again. She said we don't mix with
   Blacks. That's all she would say. Later, I asked my mom what she meant.
   Mom said that grandma had moved to the city from the farm and she had
   no experience with people of other races. She said Grandma was
   prejudiced. I asked what that meant. Mom said prejudice was fear of
   others because they are different from us. She said there were lots of
   ways to be prejudiced but race was the most common. I went to public
   school and in the 50's there wasn't much integration so I didn't have
   many interactions with other races. In high school, after I started
   dating, my dad told me to never bring a Black man home to meet him or
   he'd knock him down the front steps. That's all I can ever remember him
   saying about race. Later, at his wake, several Black men came up to me
   and told me how kind and helpful he'd been to them. When I was 8 years
   old, my grandma moved across town and her neighbor was a Black woman.
   Irma soon became my friend. I would go to her house and sit with her in
   the swing on her front porch. I got my grandma to come along. As we all
   got to know each other, a transformation happened in my grandma and she
   began to lose her fear of Blacks. We met Irma's niece and her husband
   and their two sons. Grandma even let me go to church with them.
   Everyone there said I was the cutest little thing. It was my first
   experience being a minority. In college I lived in a single room on the
   first floor of the dorm. A young Black woman named Betty was in the
   room next to mine. Getting to know her was helpful. I learned the
   pressure she felt from Whites to fit in and from her Black friends to
   remain aloof. Poor Betty faced a daily struggle with deciding how to
   fit in. When her Black friends were gone, Betty would hang out with the
   rest of us. But whenever they were around, she didn't try to introduce
   us or interact. Maybe that's what they wanted. This was in the late
   60's and schools were integrated then. But in the lunch room we didn't
   integrate. We sat at separate tables, by choice. I just heard Chris
   Mathews talking on Hardball with Eugene Robinson and Chris pointed out
   how we still segregate ourselves in church, at parties, in common lunch
   rooms, etc. When will it ever end? When will we stop fearing people who
   are "others" and start seeing the humanity in each other? Let's talk
   about it and confront our attitudes in the light of day. That way we
   can get rid of outdated prejudices and start working together. This
   country needs us to work together. The problems we face require 100%
   participation. That's what I think.

[36]Her Last Day

   Mom had fallen about three weeks earlier and cracked some ribs on a
   cement step. She'd been to the Prompt Care and was seeming to do
   better. So, I left town to attend a conference. I stopped at my son's
   on the way home for a short visit. On Sunday, I stopped to see Mom.
   She'd been admitted to the hospital the day before. She had some
   internal bleeding from the rib fractures and the fact that she was on
   coumadin for Atrial Fibrillation. She was in a lot of discomfort. I
   spent the afternoon with her, then, went home to my husband. The next
   morning, I was on my way to work when I got the intuition that I should
   go to the hospital instead. I've learned over the years to trust that
   feeling. So, I called my principal to tell him I would not be coming in
   that day. When I got to the hospital, her physician was just leaving. I
   had time to ask him about her kidney function and he just dismissed my
   concerns and told me it would return to normal as soon as she got
   better. The first words out of her mouth were, "I don't want to live
   another day if I have to endure this much pain." The plan as I
   understood it was for a consult with a thoracic surgeon, vitamin K
   shots to coagualte her blood, and then typing her blood for possible
   surgery. The very first problem we encountered was the inability of the
   phlebotomist to hit a vein. This process was very painful. They finally
   found someone who got the job done. Then, the surgeon came in. He told
   mom that if they could get her blood count up through transfusions, he
   would do surgery on her the next morning. He said he'd have to leave a
   drain in the incision for several weeks but that she could go home with
   home nursing care. As he laid out the whole process, I could see her
   withdraw. After he left, she put her head back in the chair and closed
   her eyes. I believe in my heart she asked God to take her home that
   day. Shortly afterward, everything started happening so fast that it is
   a blur. I just know that soon the nurse came to say they were
   transferring her to Intensive Care. The last thing I heard her say was,
   "Help me." When I got to the Intensive Care Unit, they were getting her
   settled in her bed. They finally let me in. She was lying on her back,
   breathing, eyes closed. I don't think she was there anymore. Her body
   was alive but I felt no connection. The nurse asked me if I had anyone
   to call to be with me and if I wanted her put on a respirator. I asked
   for a minute to think. As I stood there beside the bed, I "knew" she'd
   be very upset with me if I allowed that. She had a "Do Not Resuscitate"
   order on file. Just then a thoracic specialist came in and suggested we
   try to get her some air by draining the fluid from her lungs. I
   reminded him of her DNR order and gave permission for him to try. Her
   heart stopped while he was in the process. Although I still miss her
   terribly, I am at peace because I think we tried what we could but it
   was her time to depart.

[40]Sheri

   My friend Sheri called me one evening and told me she'd found a lump in
   her breast, had it biopsied, and was having a mastectomy in the
   morning. I was shocked. She told me not to worry and that it would be
   okay. We talked about why not a lumpectomy and about her husband and
   daughter. Later, I remembered another lady from my church who'd had the
   same surgery and I called her to ask if she could go see Sheri that
   night before the surgery. Sheri wasn't mad at me and was actually
   grateful to have someone to talk with who'd been through the procedure.
   I first met Sheri about 8 years earlier when my oldest son was ready
   for preschool. Sheri had a degree in early childhood education and had
   pioneered our local YWCA's Little School for 3-4 year old's. We lived
   at the duck hunting club and Sheri always made home visits before a
   child started in her classes. Now, it was 3 miles from the gate to our
   house and I was running late the day she was to arrive. Our road was a
   muddy mess so I was supposed to meet her at the gate. As I drove to the
   gate, here came Sheri, pant legs rolled up and shoes dangling from her
   purse slugging her way through the mud so she wouldn't be late to her
   next appointment. That is the kind of person she was. Over the years
   that my boys attended her preschool, we became good friends and prayer
   partners. We eventually started a prayer group with another friend,
   Carol. What a blessed oasis that weekly meeting was for the three of
   us! We were all busy, working mom's and this was an hour respite from
   our hectic lives. Sheri took radiation and chemo for her cancer. She
   worked the whole time and would cry with me about feeling like she was
   failing us by being so weak and tired. She survived the treatments and
   saw her daughter off to college before the cancer returned. This time
   it was in her neck. She had more radiation that shrunk the tumor. It
   was parent's weekend at the college and Sheri and Dick returned home
   just as Sheri got very ill. Her ureters were blocked and she was in
   such pain. The doctor did surgery to open them up. Carol and I waited
   till Sheri's husband told us she was in recovery and he was going to
   stay the night before we went home to our families. About 4 AM he
   called. He'd only left for a bit to go home and shower and clean up.
   The nurse found her and Sheri's heart had stopped. They did a code blue
   and got it started, but, she'd been out too long. The next day they did
   an EEG and there was no brain activity. Her family took her off life
   support and that was how she died. When I learned the news I was so mad
   at her husband for leaving her. Either Carol or I would have been happy
   to have stayed with her if only he'd called us. As I was driving back
   to town from the school I was at when I got the call, I felt her
   presence in the car and I sensed that Sheri was there to let me know
   that it was all right. I've never lost that feeling and I know that
   right now I can ask "What would Sheri say or do?" and the answer will
   be there for me. Sheri taught me that when you love someone, they
   become a part of you and always abide with you even if not physically
   present. You see, she was a great teacher.
