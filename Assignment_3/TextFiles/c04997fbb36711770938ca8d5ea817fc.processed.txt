[10]How To Sell Music Online

   In the last 5 years research has shown that more and more record labels
   are starting to go into debt while new music artists are blowing up and
   selling their music thousands of records without the help of these big
   time production companies.The simple answer to this is that these music
   artists have discovered that the internet can be used for more than
   just web browsing! Hundreds of websites have been created to allow
   these budding artists to sell their music right here on the internet.

   Site’s such as ReverbNation, SoundClick, and even MySpace let you sell
   your music right off of the account you set up. All you need is a
   working computer, a professional picture of yourself, a bio you’ve
   written, and really good tracks that you have recorded that your fans
   can buy. You can even set up an account on iTunes for a small fee and
   sell your tracks right off of there as well. Everything is automated
   with these sites as your fans purchase your records. You won’t have to
   worry about having to do the transactions by hand at all. You will need
   to set up a Pay pal account so that you have a place to receive the
   money when someone buys your music. PayPal is totally free and easy to
   set up.

   If you already have a following online then that is great. It will be
   much easier to sell to your fans who are already online listening to
   your music. If you do not have a fan base online I highly suggest that
   you do that before you start trying to sell your music online. You
   don’t want to follow these instructions and end up not making any sales
   because no one knows who you are. I see a lot of musicians doing this,
   so I like to warn others by letting them know it’s all about building a
   brand around yourself before trying to sell anything to anyone.

   Trying to sell music online, it is not a complicated thing. Once you
   have signed up to some of these sites I mentioned above you should
   start seeing results very soon. There is nothing better than being able
   to sell your music without worrying about not getting a big record
   label to sign you. If you do this, record labels will come to you
   asking if you would sign under them because they will see how much of a
   buzz you have created without them.
