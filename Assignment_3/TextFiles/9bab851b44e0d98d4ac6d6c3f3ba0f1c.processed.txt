Fashion, Poetry and Music.

   These past couple of weeks, we've been following some incredible
   visionaries in fashion, music and poetry.
   We caught up with young pioneers chasing dreams and making waves. Each
   of them, whether its in the fashion retail industry, poetry scene and
   music landscape, have made a solid name for themselves despite being
   young.
   We took to the East Coast, eThekwini, eGagasini to hang out with Kundai
   Vera, known on these streets as Project Kay as he filmed his new music
   video. As music producer, visual effects artist and of course music
   artist, Project Kay exhibits raw talent and skill for enticing the
   audience. What a pleasure to watch him in action.
   The Amazing Slum Intellect, an Eastern Cape born, but Durban-bred poet
   took a few minutes out of is time to share with us his rise in the fast
   growing industry of poetry. We were awed at his humility and even more
   impressed by the rhymes he spit for us.
   Last, but definitely not least, trendy guys from fashion capitals
   Joburg and Cape Town, who you'll know as the owners and founders of
   Cove Fashion chat to us about their online retail store. Access to
   fashion should have no limits and these guys provide just that.
   Enjoy!

   In an effort to get the word out we’ve created a series of behind the
   scenes clips to promote the track which we will be releasing on our
   YouTube account once a week to help promote the music video. To give a
   little background on the song “What I want” is a song by Project-kay
   featuring Ushe-S, Clara-T and Flowsik. It’s a very grimy hip-hop track
   which features fast paced flows over a very hard drum driven beat
   produced by Project-kay (song to be released 2 weeks from now). Due to
   the nature of the rhymes and feel the track we decided to shoot the
   video in an old prison in Pietermaritzburg (KZN). This behind the
   scenes clip features one of the artist’s featured on the track
   “Clara-T” and is an on set interview with her where she talks about her
   experience on set.

   THE AMAZING SLUM INTELLECT
   Tell us a little about yourself.
   Its nothing interesting , I’m from Lusikisiki but grew up in Durban
   started writing when I was in grade six , it was some pretty weak stuff
   though. Until I met this guy called Mystic who I becam close friends
   with that’s when I grew a lot as a writer
   How did the name Amazing The Slum Intellect come about?
    My rap name before was Mini Virus, when I met mystic in boarding
   school I rapped for him and he thought it was amazing and so he named
   me Amazing. The Slum Intellect I named myself, so it was Amazing The
   Slum Intellect a mixture of what of what Mystic thought and what I
   think of myself.

   Where or who do you draw your inspiration from?
   From everything, stuff that  I have gone through, things that I see and
   generally from other Artist. If your a poet and I enjoy your poetry,
   then I am going to draw inspiration from your technique as a writer and
   try to improve myself.
   Do you have any great writers that you admire?
   Frantz Fanon I enjoy his work, George Orwell and Mongane Serote. Myself
   also, I would like  to believe I’m great writer.
   What made you enter the Human Rights Day event that you actually won?
   I got an invite on Facebook  to go check it out. I entered I was not
   even aware that it was a competition, all I  wanted to do was perform.
   Do you let other people read your poetry?
   I do not let them read, they can hear it I can recite anything for
   anyone. If I give them my book there is a whole lot of scratched out
   lines , I don’t want people seeing stuff that I wrote and did not think
   it was good enough.
   Where would you like to go with your poetry?
    I’d like to believe that I will be a established poet one day. In the
   sense that I can say stuff and influence people on how they think and
   how they view the world, I hope it is not just for entertainment.
   Advice on how people can embrace poetry?
   I think poetry starts with music; most people say it’s the other way
   round. In this day of age not a lot of people listen to poetry. You
   really have to start from the music and then introduce poetry through
   music. Which is why I rap and I’m with a production called No way Out
   Productions because we are trying to push the message through the
   music. Once someone has gotten into the music, then they can phase the
   beats out, phase the instruments out and listen to the words.
