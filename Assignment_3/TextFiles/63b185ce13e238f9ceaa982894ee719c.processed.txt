Not All Those Who Wander Are Lost

              Not all those who wander are lost - J.R.R Tolkien

Monday, 23 June 2014

[8]hello again.

   So there is simply no other way to put it - I have neglected blogging
   recently, and feel the need to post something (on my mother's
   suggestion) just to ensure people know that my lack of writing does not
   mean that I've been hugging myself in a corner of some dark room, quite
   the opposite in fact.
   [9][mcgonagall+giddy.gif]
   In Canada, blogging became a sort of therapy - by recording the many
   adventures of Hannah and Alice, I could remind myself that the
   experience was actually worthwhile. In Germany, however, I very quickly
   discovered a very different therapy: beer.
   Okay, so before my mother starts absolutely panicking that I've turned
   to alcoholism to deal with things, it's not just beer. The people I
   have met here have been an absolute godsend, and they could not have
   come at a better time. I came to Germany a bit of a wreck, counting the
   days down until I could go back to England and just live normally. I'd
   planned to go home for my 21st, to give myself a break from being away
   and to see my friends and family at home.
   All that changed very quickly, and needless to say I didn't end up
   going home for my birthday. Germany has well and truly won me over.
   Having been force fed countless stories of just how good year abroad
   would be/will be/is, I feel like I'm genuinely living my own story
   right now.
   So now that I'm done with all that general crap, what the hell have I
   been doing for the past two months? Good question, really. The last two
   months have been littered with all the best aspects of a year abroad:
   new people, travelling and copious amounts of beer. I shan't bore you
   with tales of everything that we've done, but a few photos and
   highlights surely will suffice (God, that sentence sounds like I've
   just fallen out of some exclusive private school... fear not, I am as
   Geordie as ever, even if Chris will tell you that I speak like an
   American...):
   Frühlingsfest
   ...what a damn good weekend. Having never been bothered about the whole
   beer fest experience, I made a very last gasp decision on the Friday to
   rent a dirndl (traditional Bavarian dress). Best decision I've ever
   made - dirndls are possibly the greatest invention EVER. Saturday was
   our first venture to Frühlingsfest, and it was hellish funny. Too many
   Brits and Irish thinking we were the bosses of life and swigging down
   Maße of beer like it was water. Naturally led to all of us being
   absolutely off our faces, me falling off tables and having strange
   encounters with Stuttgart fans in the vicinity. When I eventually got
   home on the Saturday night, I'd already made the decision to go back
   the next day, when I went with my flatmate Christian, and his friends,
   before Chris and Adam eventually dragged their arses out of bed to join
   us. I feel Frühlingsfest has kicked off what is bound to be a lifelong
   passion for German festivals (and dirndls).

   Munich
   Travelled to Munich with my flatmates Christian and Annie, and stayed
   with Christian's friend Johannes in good ol' G-Town. Our time seems to
   just have involved beer and a severe lack of sleep, but it was such a
   good laugh. Personal highlights include being taught the Discofox by
   the most Bavarian looking guy I've ever seen #lederhosen, wandering
   around on the ONE sunny day in a dirndl and people just thinking it was
   totally fine (God bless Bavaria), buying my very own dirndl which I
   then travelled home to Tubs in, and of course the legend of the toilet
   brush. Oh Munich, I miss you already...

   The final day, the one sunny day. Beautiful day in Andechs.
   My 21st
   People always make such a big deal out of 21st birthdays, and God knows
   I really wasn't arsed about celebrating mine. This year has been such a
   bloody rollercoaster, I didn't really want to mark it with a big party.
   However, once I'd decided I was staying in the country, I decided
   celebrating it was a really good idea. Beer pong and Kuckuck (student
   bar, cheeeeeap as) with people from all over the world that I've been
   fortunate enough to meet this year, I don't think I could have topped
   it if I tried. I definitely won more than I lost at beer pong too... I
   think. A certain Eleanor made her way up from Freiburg too, which was
   spectacular. My presents included gin, white chocolate and a German
   party CD, which sums me up far too well and too easily.

   Rebs' Visit
   Whilst I can say quite categorically that I am not a bit homesick (I
   know, I'm surprised too), it's still the best thing ever to talk to my
   best friends at home. It was so beautiful to have Rebs' visit, and it
   reminded me how big a part of my life my friends at home still continue
   to play. I may not miss home, but I miss you all and love you all.
   Well, most of you. Even Kevin sometimes :)

   I think that's a fairly decent catch up for you all for now. Hopefully
   I will remember to write something before too long... but it is World
   Cup season so I make no promises.
   And just to clarify, I am most definitely cheering on Germany for the
   WM2014.

[39]change

   If I had written this blog post a week ago, things would have been so
   very different. Last Monday (Easter Monday), I was incredibly stressed
   out by the German uni experience, and truly considering packing it and
   giving up, sacking my degree off and just going home. Some rather
   wonderful people gave me all the advice in the world, and after lots
   and lots of tears, I finally left my room, finding two of my flatmates
   in the kitchen, who ignored my tear-stained face and instead took me in
   and drank gin with me.
   A week later, life is completely different. I am becoming more and more
   comfortable and at home here every day, and it's largely down to my
   flat. Whilst generally quiet, I have a couple of really lovely friends
   that I live with, and seem to spend an increasing amount of time with.
   It frequently involves alcohol, which was wonderful at first for
   breaking down the barriers, but now it just makes things even funnier.
   Especially when Hannes, who is at 19 the youngest of us, decides he is
   most definitely not drunk (after telling you how much he LOVES to speak
   English at least 7 times), and finishes 6 beers and then helps kill a
   few bottles of wine too. Needless to say, he was a bit grim the next
   day.
   [40][tumblr_m5czbaGH7f1rwcc6bo1_500.gif]
   Weekends here are pretty quiet, as, as is the norm here, many people go
   home for the weekend. Last weekend it felt like Christian & I were the
   only flatmates here, so we spent a hell of a lot of it watching TV
   (some good, mostly bad).
   Uni is still pretty crap, but I attend to tick the box. Every day I
   look forward to getting out, going home to my flat and enjoying the
   evening conversation.
   It was Chris' 21st last week, and he decided to go to this club near my
   flat called Top 10. As his flat is the opposite side of town, I opted
   to stay in with Christian & Hannes and watch the Madrid vs Bayern game
   as my predrinks. When I eventually got to Top 10 (free entry finishes
   at 11, got in at 10.59 #booyah), Chris was absolutely mortal already.
   However, it was genuinely one of the best night's out I have EVER had.
   There's a rotating dance floor, podiums, and best of all the fiesta
   room, which plays party classics like Barbie Girl and the Macarena ALL
   THE TIME. IT'S SO MUCH FUN. Plus it's super close to home so when I
   stumble home drunk, it's really not that far. Plus they give you a card
   when you go in to pay on, and like you pay it off as you leave. I
   bought two Desperado's that night - only paid for one, as one of them
   mustn't have scanned properly. WINNING.
   [41][tumblr_n2qwe6LK7r1r0pizwo1_500.gif]
   Anyway, Chris was crunk but sensible enough to take himself home just
   after midnight (ahahah). Ah well, you're only 21 once right pal?
   [42][CIMG7017.JPG]
   [43][CIMG7040.JPG]
   [44][CIMG7043.JPG]
   Anyway, I've come to this weird realisation that I kinda love Germany,
   and the German language, even if I am terrified to speak it. I find it
   so much more fun and interesting than French, and though I still avoid
   speaking it at all costs, I'm growing ever more fond of it. I shan't
   bore you any longer though, as it's pretty late and I need to be rested
   for the Bayern Madrid second leg tomorrow. And I guess I have homework
   to do tomorrow too, but priorities...
   Bis bald x

[53]An Onslaught Of GIFs Because I'm Stressed And Want To Rant

   I'm having an absolute stress out over university modules and therefore
   have decided to content myself with a bit of fruitless ranting on here.
   I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to the University of
   Tubingen, for being absolutely hopeless at providing any worthwhile
   information, and for being generally the most unhelpful institution
   known to mankind.
   [54][tumblr_mymvkpPZZe1t1ama2o2_500.gif]
   I am sure that lack of organisation is something that all my friends
   have suffered from on their year abroad, so I'm perfectly confident
   that I am not alone and everyone else is nodding away furiously,
   perhaps even banging their fists on their desks and saying "right on
   sistah" (I'm 100% taking the piss now, just to clarify).
   I'm seriously annoyed at the fact that I can't find anything relevant
   to help me pick my modules, which, just so you know, has to be done all
   in time for courses to start on Monday. Grand. In an effort to make
   myself feel better, I have been watching this gif for about ten
   minutes. It's helping, it's definitely helping.
   [55][Wibbly-Wobbly-Dance.gif]
   In a somewhat desperate attempt to make that picture relevant to this
   post, and not just as an excuse to watch Matt Smith do the Drunk
   Giraffe over and over (and over and over and over and over again), I
   will ramble on.
   I had hoped my semester abroad would be something like that: stupid,
   silly, hilarious, drunk (and preferably involving Matt Smith... I
   digress). Instead I have found it to be the most badly organised thing.
   Ever. And drunk has gone out of the window because I'm trying not to
   drink. In Germany, land of beer, beer and more beer. And really cheap
   Bombay Sapphire. GOOD ONE HANNAH.
   Anyway. So now I'm like this:
   [56][200.gif]
   (Can you tell I've FINALLY worked out how to put gifs in my blog?!
   WINNNNNNING)
   Anyway, so this has sort of worked and I'm feeling a lot calmer now,
   even though I'm still super angry that there is NO help. Tubingen
   continues to be exceptionally beautiful, even though it rained today,
   but I have taken up eating out far too much and we've already found our
   regular bar haunt. Which is an issue, because they also sell cake...
   Anyway, it is the most hipster bar of all time, where everyone sits
   around smoking whilst sipping some rhubarb flavoured thing, playing on
   their MacBooks, probably googling something really cool and indie.
   They're so indie, they probably don't use Google because it's too
   mainstream.
   Meanwhile, we play Cluedo, thanks to the enormous collection of German
   board games.
   Sadly, I do not know the name of this bar, because it has too many
   letters and, like most of the German language, is wholly
   unpronounceable.
   [EMBED]
   Aside from that, we don't do much else, apart from eat organic ice
   cream (don't ask me why it's organic) and wander around. Oh, and I'm
   trying to get Chris through as much Doctor Who as is physically
   possible. Which leaves me like this:
   [57][tumblr_m08oobV4r01qcwhkeo1_400.gif]
   And Chris probably like this:
   [58][tumblr_m3jg9lftxf1r6aoq4o1_500.gif]
   RANT OVER. BYEEEEEE

[67]OKAY UPDATE.

   Okay so it's been an absolute AGE since I even considered writing this.
   So I'm going to try and cover as much as is physically possible in the
   shortest blog post possible, but, as it's me, I'll probs talk crap for
   three or four hours. Bear with me.
   Okay, so firstly, Alice and I planned a very spontaneous trip to
   Toronto. Completing a life long (okay, six month long) dream to take
   the Greyhound, I was very quickly over it - longest bus journey EVER.
   However, we'd opted for a hostel in the hope of saving money - turns
   out we'd picked out THE most hipster hostel know to man, complete with
   iMacs in the lobby, and it actually ended up being more expensive than
   a hotel. Damn.
   Anyway, Toronto was fairly good. We walked so much my feet were
   SCREAMING out in pain, but we managed to visit a fair bit, did the
   aquarium, I did the CN tower (selfie central) and we made it to Niagara
   Falls, albeit via the WORST organised tour in history. The driver left
   people behind at stops on the way not once, but twice, and then lied to
   us about the trip we wanted to do, and then almost fell asleep on the
   journey home. It was ridiculous, but we got to the falls and they were
   pretty frozen which was REALLY cool (literally). We also got to the
   Hard Rock Cafe, so I had ribs (naturally) and forced myself to eat it
   all. I am the queen of ribs. Anyway, a ridic trip back to Quebec, in
   which we missed our bus and then had to buy new tickets, and we were
   back in QC.
   [68][DSC_0125.JPG]

   The end of my time in Quebec came fairly quickly. I was sadder than I
   thought I'd be, if I'm honest. I did shed a few tears as I left my
   house for the final time, but we were off to NYC for the cruise, so I
   cheered up fairly quickly, even if they did spring the extra cost of
   baggage on me at the airport.
   The cruise was really good; we played quizzes that we were fairly good
   at it, and we played quizzes that we were absolutely terrible at (The
   Beatles). We watched some fairly bizarre things (Dancing With The
   Breakaway Stars being the weirdest - members of the crew dancing, for
   want of a better word, with the passengers, but saw Rock Of Ages, which
   was really good, and a pretty funny comedy show.
   Our first stop was Orlando, where we went to Universal's Islands of
   Adventure. It was really cool in general, the Harry Potter bit was
   absolutely unreal, obviously. We then played a game of Russian Roulette
   with Bertie Bott's Every Flavoured Beans... trust me, they really do
   mean every flavour. URGH. Dirt made my breath smell SO unbelievably
   bad, and then I was unfortunate enough to get a rotten egg one. I can't
   even explain how disgusting that was. I also bought another Hard Rock
   T-shirt, yessaaa.

   Our next stop was a private island in the Bahamas. It was SO beautiful.
   Bottling out of beach yoga, we spent the day laying about next to this
   incredible lagoon. I wish I could just sit there forever, it was so
   beautiful.
   [92][DSC_0137.JPG]
   [93][DSC_0139.JPG]
   [94][DSC_0148.JPG]
   Our final day off ship was in Nassau, Bahamas, where I bought YET
   another Hard Rock T-shirt. We did a segway tour through the town which
   was really cool, even though my feet ached by the end of it. Having
   loads of time left, we tried our luck at the tourist info centre to get
   a tour of the place. We were taken up on our offer by this tour guide
   called Dave, but, as he told us, we could call him Bubba. Best guy
   ever. He kept saying "yah man" and gave us this really cool tour of the
   island, letting us take pictures and taking us to visit the Atlantis
   hotel. He was so sweet.

   So yeah, the cruise was pretty awesome. We even played bingo. HAHAHA.
   There was a particularly rough night though, and I'm talking a 40 foot
   wave kind of night. No sleep was had by ANYONE on that ship, I swear.
   Alice & I found it hilarious - clearly we were delirious with
   exhaustion, because in reality it should have been absolutely
   terrifying. It was really like something off Paranormal Activity -
   everything in the room started flying around, falling off shelves,
   tables... you name it, it was on the floor by the end of the night. The
   bathroom light even broke, and the door wouldn't stop swinging open.
   Alice, in an attempt to determine just what was on the floor, stood on
   the little desk sign and broke it, which is apparently hilarious at
   3am. The captain had to make an announcement at 5am to reassure us all
   that we were in fact not going to die. If it wasn't all so ridiculous
   and if we weren't so tired, we'd probably have been kitted out in our
   life jackets all night. We probably should have been to be fair.
   Despite the waves though, we both managed to avoid sea sickness...
   until I stood up to get up in the morning and spent the next few hours
   curled up in the bathroom. urgh. Alice definitely won on the seasick
   scale, she's a trooper!
   After the cruise, and a fairly calm goodbye to the bestest bud and
   travelling accomplice that I could have asked for, I headed home for
   three weeks, which was SO good.
   AND HERE WE ARE.
   I'm now in Tuebingen, Germany, where I'm studying for a semester. I've
   got friends from uni (holla Chris, Adam & Rosie) so it's been a
   (fairly) easy transition, though the language is kicking my backside at
   the moment. I am always accidentally rude because I'm so relieved to
   have understood what someone said, and so desperate for them not to
   continue talking, that I generally reply with "ja" or "nein". In all
   honesty, it's usually "nein," and hope and pray that they shut up.
   Hopefully that will get better with time.
   Anyway, I'm hoping uni will be better than working, but altogether I'm
   looking forward to July and being able to get settled at home again.
   However, Tuebingen, or Tubs as I affectionately (sort of) call it, is
   absolutely gorgeous. Small, yes, but it's so cute and really nice to
   just walk around, and all the people I have met so far have been really
   nice and accommodating. And it's really cheap (yay). However, I haven't
   found any sushi shops yet... boo. Everything is like weirdly organic
   though... like even ice cream... weird.

   to bore you no more than is necessary. Ciao belllllllaaaaas x
