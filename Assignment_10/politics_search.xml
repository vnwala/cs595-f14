I can&#39;t promise that it&#39;ll be just like it was here...but I&#39;m going to see what I can do. At least I&#39;ll give it a try for a while, and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another front...no, the rss feed for the new place isn&#39;t ready yet. Yes, it&#39;s still planned. They&#39;re doing a site redesign, and they&#39;ve assured me that when the redesign is ready, the rss feed will be. And that&#39;s supposed to be?

But in fact the big day is tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/view/&quot;&gt;Bloomberg View is here&lt;/a&gt;. And they already have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/view/bios/jonathan-bernstein/&quot;&gt;a page for me, here&lt;/a&gt;. Empty now, but by late morning tomorrow there should be something there. I&#39;m afraid at first there won&#39;t be a dedicated rss feed, but they&#39;re actually a few weeks away from a redesign, and among other things one of the benefits will be rss feeds for the authors. I&#39;ll have all of that easy to find here once it happens. Meanwhile, you can use that bio page for all new posts, and of course I&#39;ll be tweeting out new posts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I think this site is going to go dormant, most likely, although I haven&#39;t made any final decisions. I suppose I could use it for any off-topic or personal posting, but I don&#39;t really do that sort of thing (and the View folks have assured me every time I bring it up that anything I&#39;ve written here would be on-topic there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For regulars: I know you&#39;ve expressed some concerns about comments. I don&#39;t really have a sense yet of how that will go -- but I&#39;m willing to give it an initial try to keep the comments section over there a value-added portion of the blog, as I very much think it has been here. I hate to say it, but probably the best way for that to happen is if some of the regulars here flood the zone at first...but, again, I don&#39;t really have a sense of how it will go. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also for regulars: I&#39;m keeping the morning links posts, pretty much as-is, but I&#39;m thinking about coming up with a new name. I know some of you hate &quot;Read Stuff,&quot; and I don&#39;t mind taking the opportunity to switch it at this point...but I&#39;ve come up blank so far. I&#39;m thinking about song titles/lyrics... The Beatles&#39; &quot;Good Morning&quot; seems trite, Tim Armstrong&#39;s &quot;Wake up, you son of a bitch&quot; too nasty. I can&#39;t say that Colin Moulding&#39;s &quot;Wake Up&quot; is one of my favorites...there sure are a lot of songs called &quot;Wake Up,&quot; aren&#39;t there? I could always go with New Day Rising. I can&#39;t think of a good one from Kristin Hersch, or even from Elvis Costello...what am I missing? At any rate, I&#39;m taking suggestions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One way or another, it&#39;s time for the big move.

Can&#39;t miss this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we all know, this year&#39;s ballot for the real voters is unlike any normal one: instead of being about which marginal guys deserve to be in, it&#39;s about dealing with the strategy of what to do with far more deserving players than the rules allow. There was a bit of this last year, but now it&#39;s getting silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So. Some sorting is in order. &lt;a href=&quot;http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2012/12/friday-baseball-post_31.html&quot;&gt;Last year&lt;/a&gt; I had nine easy choices: Bonds, Clemens, Biggio, Piazza, Schilling, McGwire, Raines, Trammell, and Bagwell, all of whom are back this year. Then I had three bubble guys, and said I would have voted for Palmiero for strategic reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s not going to work this time, because the nine easy ones all return, joined by Maddux, Mussina, Thomas, and Glavine. So that&#39;s thirteen guys who, to me, are obvious HOFers. There&#39;s also Jeff Kent, who for now I&#39;ll say joins the bubbles, with Palmiero, Sosa, and Edgar Martinez (and McGriff, although last year I concluded that he was a stretch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do we do with it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s no good solution. One way to go after it would be to forget strategic issues and just pick the best ten. Another way, and I think the way to go, is to worry mostly about ballot strategy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are really, I think, three issues. One is to support guys who are in danger of falling off the ballot: that would be, I think, Palimiero, Sosa, McGwire, and Kent. I&#39;ve said in the past that I think Palmiero and McGwire are over my line; I haven&#39;t really decided on Sosa or, now, Kent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second is to support the guys who are relatively undervalued by HOF votes. For me, that&#39;s McGwire, Trammell, Bonds, Clemens, Raines, and maybe Piazza and Schilling -- all (to me) clear, easy, HOFers, but all having trouble with the voters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third is to put guys over the top in order to help clear the gridlock. Who is going to be right around the line this year? Biggio, I think, is the only obvious one. I&#39;m guessing that Maddux makes it easily, and that the other three new ones fall short, although maybe the Hurt comes close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, as you may have noticed, strategies two and three conflict with each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I think that organizes things enough. Drop Maddux, who gets in anyway. Drop Bagwell -- he&#39;s not going to make it this year, but he&#39;s in the safe zone. And then drop...I don&#39;t know, Mussina, I guess, on the theory that he&#39;s less likely to make it this year than Glavine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, reluctantly, drop the bubble guys. Maybe I&#39;d feel differently if I had a real ballot...I&#39;m awfully tempted to include Palmiero, Sosa, Kent, and maybe even Edgar just to make sure they all stay on the ballot, although I suspect that Kent and Martinez are relatively safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that gets me: McGwire, Trammell, Bonds, Clemens, Raines, Piazza, Schilling, Glavine, Biggio, Thomas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one main point: if you think that McGwire (or Palmiero or Sosa) is a clear HOFer, then you really should find room for them on your ballot this year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note too that at least as far as leaving Maddux off is concerned, this would be strategic voting which depends on other voters following different logic. As far as I&#39;m aware (and I&#39;ve seen &lt;a href=&quot;http://sulia.com/hankschulman/f/4de5747f-f9e0-4f68-8bbc-28fc8f8ba7c5/?source=twitter&amp;amp;guid=4de5747f-f9e0-4f68-8bbc-28fc8f8ba7c5&quot;&gt;Hank Schulman&#39;s ballot&lt;/a&gt;, but otherwise I missed most of the debates while I&#39;ve been on vacation), no one is thinking of leaving Maddux off for strategic reasons, but if I was a real voter I&#39;d be paying closer attention and, if I thought Maddux was going to have a close call for induction this time, switch to him (over, I suppose, Glavine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, leaving Maddux off is not intended as a comment on his surgical enhancement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (OK, not technically an update since I hadn&#39;t posted yet, but I don&#39;t feel like going back and editing): it seems that I was probably &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseballthinkfactory.org/newsstand/discussion/the_2013_hof_ballot_collecting_gizmo&quot;&gt;correct on Maddux, but that McGwire is probably safe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, also, might as well link to Joe Sheehan &lt;a href=&quot;http://joesheehanbaseball.blogspot.com/2013/01/newsletter-extra-hall-of-fame-electorate.html&quot;&gt;on the HOF electorate&lt;/a&gt;. I hadn&#39;t really thought about the demographic issues he raises...my general sense is that the HOF has been pretty happy using the BBWAA, and that they&#39;re unlikely to change -- instead, what they&#39;ll do, as they&#39;ve always done, is resort to ad hoc rules changes and special committees (and both) to rectify problems that arise, which (as Bill James pointed out) for the BBWAA basically means any interruption of a steady flow of new inductions. But Sheehan makes some good points about why the current system may not prove stable over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I&#39;m skipping the part where I argue about why the 13 easy picks are actually clear HOFers, and why the bubble guys are bubble guys, and why the rest shouldn&#39;t be in. I&#39;ve argued all of this in the past except for the new guys, so my apologies for skipping it (if you really want to know, click the link above to last year&#39;s post, and work back from there). Anyway, my basic view is that I prefer a fairly generous HOF size, and I really don&#39;t think any of these guys are close calls at all; better to focus on the more interesting stuff.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/2300228825397640350/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2014/01/friday-baseball-post.html#comment-form' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/2300228825397640350'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/2300228825397640350'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2014/01/friday-baseball-post.html' title='Friday Baseball Post'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-902090411740500133</id><published>2013-12-29T22:16:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-29T22:16:50.287-06:00</updated><title type='text'>Sunday Question for Everyone</title><content type='html'>What&#39;s a realistic policy outcome you are particularly hoping for in 2014?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/902090411740500133/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/sunday-question-for-everyone_29.html#comment-form' title='19 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/902090411740500133'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/902090411740500133'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/sunday-question-for-everyone_29.html' title='Sunday Question for Everyone'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>19</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-493981083326263447</id><published>2013-12-29T12:50:00.003-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-29T12:50:30.113-06:00</updated><title type='text'>What Mattered This Week?</title><content type='html'>Okay, I know, I&#39;m a day late, and I&#39;m not sure if any of you are around anyway, and even worse I&#39;ve really been on full vacation this week and can&#39;t even suggest anything...but let&#39;s do What Mattered anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway: what have you noticed?

The plan is basically to do what I&#39;ve been doing since I started: same topics, same regular items, same everything. I won&#39;t, at least at first, be doing columns there (or elsewhere). Just the blogging, all back under the same roof, as it was when I started here. It all kicks off a little after New Year&#39;s. I&#39;m very excited about it; it&#39;s exactly what I&#39;ve wanted, having all my stuff together again (and, yes, to get paid for it, too). I&#39;m very impressed with the folks over at Bloomberg View; all I can tell you is that every time I asked any of them about whether they wanted more of this or less of that, they basically had the same answer: we like what you&#39;ve done, so keep doing it. So that&#39;s what you can expect when I get over there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do I want to do now? I want to thank a whole lot of people. John Sides and Seth Masket, for linking to me and making me surface-respectable right away. Andrew Sullivan was very generous with his support from very early on. Ezra Klein has been terribly important in boosting the meeting of political scientists and journalists, both publicly with links and other support and behind the scenes. Both Andrew and Ezra trusted me with guest-blogging gigs well before I was anyone&#39;s obvious choice for that sort of thing. Matt Yglesias, Kevin Drum, and Jonathan Cohn have been very generous, again from early on, with both links and with occasional advice when I asked. And certainly Greg Sargent has done more for me than I can ever hope to repay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More: the people at The New Republic, Salon, and the Prospect who picked up my stuff. Paul Glastris, too, at Washington Monthly, and Fred Hiatt at the Post. Also the editors who I&#39;ve worked with and taught me how to write columns...quite a few good ones, but especially Seyward Darby, Gabriel Arana, and Jaime Fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m missing a lot, and I apologize to those I&#39;m leaving out. If anyone is still reading: what I need to impress on people is that really without exception bloggers have been extremely open and generous towards me the whole time I&#39;ve been doing this.They may bring the snark, but what&#39;s important is that they act as colleagues, not competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And thanks so much to all of you for reading Plain Blog, and especially to the commenters who made this a really nice place to hang out. I hope you all follow me over to Bloomberg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as this place...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m off on vacation beginning Sunday and going through New Year&#39;s. After that, I&#39;ll have a couple of days, and then start the new gig. I&#39;m really not sure what, if any, posting I&#39;ll be doing in the interim. Not much, for sure, but I may do the occasional item...haven&#39;t even decided whether to put What Mattered and Sunday Questions up this weekend (we&#39;re driving to Phoenix on Sunday, so I&#39;m not exactly going to be plugged in very much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, I really don&#39;t know about the old blog. I&#39;ll certainly be leaving the site up for the old posts...as of now, I&#39;m not aware of anything that I do here that they don&#39;t think fits over there. But we&#39;ll see. All I really know is that most of my stuff will be over at Bloomberg View. I&#39;ll see you there!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/170442945045524326/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/housekeeping.html#comment-form' title='48 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/170442945045524326'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/170442945045524326'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/housekeeping.html' title='Housekeeping'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>48</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-3233310527044152488</id><published>2013-12-19T20:29:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-19T20:29:15.826-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="polling"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Presidency"/><title type='text'>Elsewhere</title><content type='html'>I know there hasn&#39;t been much here lately, but I&#39;ve been busy as usual over at PP, plus a bit at Greg&#39;s place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/12/17/be-careful-with-those-polls/&quot;&gt;really skeptical about the &quot;Obamacare rollout hurt Obama&#39;s approval ratings&quot;&lt;/a&gt; story.

Now. Or at least, pending confirmations of their replacements. But before the 2014 midterms, and certainly before the 2016 elections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ginsburg has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/ginsburg-justices-shouldn-t-necessarily-resign-when-a-like-minded-president-is-in-office&quot;&gt;firing back&lt;/a&gt;. But the best case I&#39;ve seen for resisting strategic retirements comes from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/12/ruth_bader_ginsburg_s_retirement_stop_telling_the_supreme_court_justice.html&quot;&gt;Linda Greenhouse, who channels Ginsburg&lt;/a&gt; to Emily Bazelon:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;I think from her perspective she is taking a long view of history, not a case by case one, or a term by term one. She has to believe that justice will win out in the end—or that, if it doesn&#39;t, her departure at one point or another couldn&#39;t be the major factor. I agree with her and I think people ought to give this issue a rest and concentrate on electing Democrats to the White House and the Senate. ... I think the issue is serving as kind of a displacement for the liberals’ general sense of powerlessness—they seem to feel that getting Ruth to resign would be something concrete they could accomplish when all else is failing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It&#39;s a nice sounding argument, but it won&#39;t wash. &quot;Justice will win out in the end?&quot; Politics doesn&#39;t have an &quot;end.&quot; It just has a series of &quot;nows.&quot; Nor is there any certainty about any of it. Political events are incredible contingent, and path dependent; it&#39;s very, very, easy to tell counterfactual stories involving slightly different election results and the implications that spin out from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, not all events begin new paths of their own. And sometimes, the path is overwhelmed by other factors, whether they are technological, or demographic, or whatever. But Supreme Court Justices, right now, in this extremely partisan era, and in a closely divided court? I don&#39;t know anything about &quot;in the end,&quot; but it&#39;s very easy to see how a flip or two in who serves on the Court could make very large changes which would matter very much for a whole lot of people for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for most political actors, it&#39;s certainly true that there&#39;s more they can do about House and Senate elections than there is about changing the mind of two individuals. So, sure, if you&#39;re a liberal, don&#39;t get mad as Ginsburg or Breyer; help a Democrat win a Senate seat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#39;m not talking about what Democratic activists want -- after all, many of them don&#39;t care very much (whether they should or not) about what SCOTUS does. At best, most activists and most voters care about one or two Court outcomes. After all, they have plenty of competing issues, and no particular reason to believe that the Court should be at the top of their list. The people who do care about what the Court does, passionately -- at least, we suspect they care passionately -- are the Justices themselves. So this is on them, not on anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of which is to say what Ginsburg or Breyer &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; do in any absolute sense. It&#39;s a great job, and both are clearly -- now -- able to do it at the highest level. As I&#39;ve said before, giving that up in order to better fight for their principles is a lot to ask. If either of them believes that it&#39;s not worth it...it&#39;s not up to any of us to pick their priorities. All I&#39;m saying, and I think it&#39;s just clearly true, is that if their top priority is fighting for the legal principles and the outcomes they prefer, then resignation is the best way to ensure that priority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/8612522040078628247/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/once-more-on-judicial-strategic.html#comment-form' title='17 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/8612522040078628247'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/8612522040078628247'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/once-more-on-judicial-strategic.html' title='Once More on Judicial Strategic Retirements'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>17</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-1624515201688477026</id><published>2013-12-19T08:25:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-19T08:25:53.555-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="climate"/><title type='text'>Read Stuff, You Should</title><content type='html'>Happy Birthday to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005347/&quot;&gt;Tim Reid&lt;/a&gt;, 69.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep thinking that some blogging will happen, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be (here; regular posts at PP all week). With any luck, this won&#39;t be the third day in a row with only the good stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/12/the-gangs-of-chicago/282468/&quot;&gt;Ta-Nehisi Coates, always.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Good analysis from Greg Sargent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/12/18/white-house-to-get-aggressive-on-climate-change/&quot;&gt;on Obama, John Podesta, and executive action on climate&lt;/a&gt;. One additional point: a normal opposition party would consider, given the possibility of significant action, cutting a deal to protect party-aligned interest groups as much as possible (while, perhaps, securing some other policy gains in return). That&#39;s essentially the story, for example of Bush&#39;s early administration education initiative. It might not end that way; the administration could reject a deal that the out-party was willing to make, or the out-party might ultimately decide that the substantive changes they could purchase wouldn&#39;t be worth it. But at any rate, with the current GOP, it&#39;s just a non-starter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.

Good</title><content type='html'>I&#39;m not sure whether it was in response to my earlier item or not, but Andrew Sprung &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/xpostfactoid1/status/412611842721075200&quot;&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;So constructive to have all hands in a major political party poised to highlight &amp;amp; gloat over every glitch in major new gov service.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Presumably he&#39;s being sarcastic, but you know what? It is constructive! It&#39;s absolutely a good thing to have a major political party poised to highlight every glitch in what government is up to. Not so much the gloating, but that&#39;s not doing any harm. The highlighting is definitely a good thing. One of the strong points of the two-party system is that it leaves an out party with every incentive to identify everything that&#39;s going wrong. Not just in government, but in the nation as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem isn&#39;t highlighting the glitches, or even gloating about them. The problem is that the current radical GOP is actively opposed to fixing ACA problems, to the point of obstructing attempted fixes. That&#39;s a problem. But it&#39;s also not normal at all. A healthy party would either promote fixes in order to get more mileage out of their claim that the administration botched thing, or at the very least use glitches and needed fixes as an opportunity to get its own policies adopted. Flat-out rejectionism is definitely a problem, but it only comes up because the normal party incentives of winning elections and enacting public policy don&#39;t seem to be working as well as they should for the radical GOP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seeking out poor public policy and calling attention to it? That&#39;s extremely healthy for the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/6237078061460637128/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/glitch-gloating-good.html#comment-form' title='11 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/6237078061460637128'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/6237078061460637128'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/glitch-gloating-good.html' title='Glitch Gloating?

Sam Baker had a longer, and also good, item about this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationaljournal.com/health-care/take-two-aspirin-and-blame-everything-on-obamacare-20131212&quot;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m gonna be churlish and say: Called it! Way back when I was a wee baby blogger, and months &lt;a href=&quot;http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2009/09/shot-with-his-own-gun.html&quot;&gt;before the ACA passed:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;On health care, it&#39;s safe to predict (if the bill passes) that even though few provisions will go into effect before the 2010 and 2012 election, Obama and the Democrats will totally own health care, at least for high-information GOP primary voters. We can expect lots of medical horror stories (true ones -- there are always true medical horror stories) that are attributed to Obamacare. On top of that, there will be death panels; not real ones, of course, but newly invented scary future effects of the newly passed bill. Any Republican who cut a deal and voted for that bill will be risking the blame, along with all Democrats, for every medical horror story that happens for the rest of their careers, but especially over the next couple election cycles (I should note that Republicans are hardly alone in that; for the past forty years Democrats have pinned all medical horror stories on reform-blocking GOP candidates. The special genius of the 2010 and 2012 cycles is that the responsibility will flip, at least for GOP primary voters, even though reform won&#39;t yet be implemented).&lt;/blockquote&gt;Okay, so I should have added the 2014 cycle, too, and probably 2016 as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still believe, by the way, that &quot;Obamacare&quot; will eventually disappear, at least assuming it&#39;s reasonably successful. Of course, the fiasco in October wasn&#39;t good for making &quot;Obamacare&quot; disappear; I&#39;ve always said that it disappears if it succeeds. It&#39;s possible, too, that the conservative information bubble is so obsessed with the law that they&#39;ll still be blaming everything up to and including the common cold on Obamacare decades from now. On the other hand, sooner or later there will be another Democratic president, and once that happens Fox News and all are sure to compare the radical socialist leftism of that new president to the reasonable moderation of Obama. Will &quot;Obamacare&quot; survive that? Hard to guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;d really love to know what percentage of people who have new insurance through the exchanges think it&#39;s &quot;Obamacare.&quot; Whatever that is -- and it&#39;s surely lower than 100% -- it&#39;s certain to decline over time. And I&#39;m guessing that only a small fraction of those with new expanded Medicaid insurance think of it as Obamacare (or ACA). Hardly anyone with employer-based insurance thinks of it as related in any way to Obamacare, I&#39;d assume; nor do they think it has anything to do with government policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the blame thing...the point isn&#39;t whether ACA is a success or not; the point is that it&#39;s going to be blamed for lots of things, many of which it has nothing to do with, whether it&#39;s a success or a failure. That&#39;s just the nature of the thing. </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/6862797295093166162/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/blame-obamacaredisappearing-obamacare.html#comment-form' title='5 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/6862797295093166162'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/6862797295093166162'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/blame-obamacaredisappearing-obamacare.html' title='Blame Obamacare/Disappearing Obamacare'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-6190307601346022009</id><published>2013-12-16T08:33:00.002-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-16T08:33:46.627-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="John Boehner"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Senate"/><title type='text'>Read Stuff, You Should</title><content type='html'>Happy Birthday to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004766/&quot;&gt;Steven Bochco&lt;/a&gt;, 70.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m traveling and in meetings early this week, so posting may be sporadic, but that&#39;s no excuse for skipping the good stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.

As a rule he’s only done this when sticking with the right would send the country past some deadline or over some cliff, and even then he’s acted reluctantly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/13/the-deal-has-passed-but-don-t-hold-your-breath-for-bipartisanship.html&quot;&gt;See also Jamelle Bouie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom-line context underlying the temporary (and it&#39;s certainly temporary) emergence of bipartisan peace in the House is the one I keep pounding on: at the end of the day, whether before or after a shutdown, John Boehner knows that eventually he and Barack Obama are going to wind up on the same side of something that funds the government going forward. That&#39;s an absolute, unavoidable fact of appropriations deadlines. Which means that at the end of the day, whatever he does on the way there, Boehner is going to be a sellout and a RINO for agreeing with the Kenyan socialist in the White House.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that context, a shutdown was, and is, an almost certain disaster for the Speaker (and for whatever Republicans would wind up voting for the eventual measure that ends the shutdown). I&#39;m still not sure why the House went down that road in October, but having done it once and (believing they) paid the price, it was e&lt;a href=&quot;http://prospect.org/article/four-reasons-we-don%E2%80%99t-need-count-down-january-shutdown&quot;&gt;ven more unlikely that they would do it a second time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there&#39;s no reason at all to believe that this means anything for those issues -- most issues -- in which there is no certainty that they end in agreement between Obama and Boehner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which means, for all those other issues, what matters is whether mainstream House Republicans want bills to pass (or, for GOP priorities, whether Obama and mainstream Senate Democrats want something to pass).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest, such as Boehner lashing out at conservative groups? It&#39;s mostly, or entirely, window dressing. This is one that fits perfectly into a story of clear incentives -- and the same incentives just aren&#39;t there on many other issues.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/6780277777653973322/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/yeah-bipartisanship-isnt-about-to-break.html#comment-form' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/6780277777653973322'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/6780277777653973322'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/yeah-bipartisanship-isnt-about-to-break.html' title='Yeah, Bipartisanship Isn&#39;t About To Break Out'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-8073734104902940986</id><published>2013-12-13T07:59:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-13T07:59:41.149-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Senate"/><title type='text'>Read Stuff, You Should</title><content type='html'>Happy Birthday to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allmusic.com/artist/television-mn0000019701&quot;&gt;Tom Verlaine&lt;/a&gt;, 64.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.

Or the second time. In fact, the evidence strongly suggests that there is, somewhere (at the RNC? Fox News?) a Senior Funeral Exploiter whose job it is to carefully monitor all funerals, memorial services, and other potentially solemn occasions in which Democratic politicians are expected to attend with the goal of finding some &quot;inappropriate&quot; behavior. And once it&#39;s identified, it spreads rapidly through the GOP-aligned press.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The classics of the genre are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB122426147041044871&quot;&gt;Paul Wellstone funeral&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/559205/posts&quot;&gt;Bill Clinton at the Ron Brown funeral&lt;/a&gt;. I seem to recall others, too, but don&#39;t have any handy citations.The Ron Brown one was classic...Republicans basically spent all eight years of the Clinton Administration trying to get everyone to accept what they thought was self-evidently true, that Clinton was a phony and a usurper; &quot;catching&quot; him &quot;faking&quot; grief at Brown&#39;s funeral, they thought, would convince everyone. Oh well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyway, what I wonder about it, as I tend to do about these things, is whether this is supply or demand driven. Is there something about the consumers in the conservative marketplace that makes Funeral Exploitation particularly lucrative? Or is this something that conservative elites just are certain will resonate, and so they&#39;re constantly pushing it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I don&#39;t recall any equivalent on the other side; please remind me if I missed anything. Surely Democrats have exploited similar &quot;gaffes,&quot; but none of them I can think of were funeral-based.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So I have no idea of why the pattern exists, although I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s not about Democrats actually being a bunch of rude jerks (I assume good manners are equally distributed among politicians).

And I think that for at least a short while -- a pause -- the etiquette issue deserves precedence over the politics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, it&#39;s polite to wait a short bit before jumping into partisan or other political point-scoring, and people should be polite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to emphasize: short bit. I&#39;m talking pause, not some sort of long-term ban. I agree that there&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with using any event as an excuse to score partisan points or to press a political argument. Politics is important! Those who want to take action don&#39;t need to apologize for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, etiquette tells us that we should act as if we respect the feelings of others, and of those feelings one would have to think that grief ranks pretty high up. Mourning is not in itself political, even if the person being mourned was intensely political; even if, as happens in some cases, the cause of death was intensely political. Those of us who live in a political world should remember that not everyone does, and that it may be particularly crass and hurtful to have to deal with that stuff along with one&#39;s grief. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no rule of thumb for how long a pause is appropriate. Certainly long enough that one&#39;s first encounter with, say, a natural disaster isn&#39;t going to be a slam at the president (or the Speaker, or whoever) for supposedly causing it. And certainly not so long that the media spotlight has moved on. I&#39;m thinking hours, not days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But yeah. Really, your Very Important Point about Ronald Reagan and Nelson Mandela could probably wait six hours, or even to the next day, without overly diminishing whatever positive effect you wanted to get out of it; you didn&#39;t need to post it on that first day. Even if you think it&#39;s outrageous that some conservatives could profess to be mourning Mandela without renouncing Reagan. There&#39;s plenty of time for that on the second day, or at least the fourth hour. The same applies to natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and whatever else sparks this kind of thing. You aren&#39;t going to be sacrificing any important political advantage if you hold off at least as long as it takes for the press to get the basic facts figured out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, though? Absolutely have at it. After all, all of us live in a political world, whether we realize it or not, and after a point pretending that we all agree about everything ceases to be polite and is, instead, just condescending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where is the line? I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a hard-and-fast answer to that. It depends on the medium, on the occasion, on the tone...lots of stuff. The point is to balance two equally worthy things: the respect that mourning and grief deserve, and the virtue in action. Etiquette rules and norms generally help us get through tough calls in these areas, but we don&#39;t have much to help us (and certainly not on twitter), so we need to muddle through. Look: there are plenty of things I&#39;d say about a colleague or acquaintance after she passed away to an outside friend who didn&#39;t know the deceased that I would never in a million years say to her family members at the funeral. Given that there are few recognized rules, all we can do is to try to be sensitive -- without shortchanging the rest of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what I have is Pause, then Politicize.

And at any rate, he&#39;s certainly right that anyone who sees something similar to Reagan/Ford, or even less plausibly Goldwater/Rockefeller, is just seeing a fantasy.

Ross Douthat &lt;a href=&quot;http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/obamacares-many-possible-futures/&quot;&gt;mentioned this one today&lt;/a&gt;: as far as we know, it turns out that employers are not dumping their employees on the exchanges. At least so far. I do think it&#39;s likely that over time the ACA will wind up pushing people out of employment-linked insurance, but it appears that a fast, destabilizing dump isn&#39;t happening. Good Douthat piece, by the way, especially in that he&#39;s absolutely right that the best way to think about the ACA now is in terms of potential outcomes and the future policy questions they will raise, not &quot;success&quot; or &quot;failure.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I talked about this yesterday...this one is less a dog not barking than a dog barking in the wrong direction, or something like that. Republican Senators are apparently doing a &quot;filibuster&quot; stunt today to protest the nuclear option (or maybe it&#39;s more of a &quot;what have you got?&quot; protest)...but they&#39;re really not shutting down the Senate. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Mansfield2016&quot;&gt;@Mansfield2016&lt;/a&gt; nailed this one (and really, follow if you&#39;re interested in judicial nominations at all, including Senate procedure and reform issues): Republicans &lt;a href=&quot;http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r113:S10DE3-0043:/&quot;&gt;haven&#39;t objected to overnight time counting towards post-cloture time&lt;/a&gt;, something they could do. The same was true yesterday for the recess for party meetings. In addition, Republicans haven&#39;t objected to having committees meet. And as other have noted, the budget wars have semi-thawed, with Senate nukes apparently having no effect at all. Yes, they have forced a few votes which weren&#39;t necessary, and by not yielding back post-cloture time (so far!) they&#39;re definitely delaying and obstructing. But remember that GOP obstruction of nominees has been the norm for years now. This very much appears to be ordinary delay, not nuclear fallout. I&#39;m increasingly confident that &lt;a href=&quot;http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/05/anticipating-nuclear-fallout.html&quot;&gt;I was right&lt;/a&gt; on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. &lt;a href=&quot;http://icasualties.org/OEF/index.aspx&quot;&gt;Afghanistan casualties&lt;/a&gt; continues to be, in my view, a very big and very undercovered story -- especially when troop deaths aren&#39;t happening. The last coalition troop death was back on &lt;a href=&quot;http://icasualties.org/OEF/Fatalities.aspx&quot;&gt;November 17&lt;/a&gt;, and there were only four in November (3 US deaths). For the year, the coalition total is 148 (118 US), down from 402 (310) last year. This year will be the fewer coalition troop deaths in Afghanistan since 2005 (US since 2007); it will be fewest combined (Afghanistan plus Iraq) troop deaths since before the Iraq war began. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve really spent enough time thinking about how being at war for over a decade matters, or how it will matter when the Afghanistan adventure ends, or at least mostly ends, in just a few more months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. And the real reason I did this one today: &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/192774-republicans-claim-fcc-working-on-fairness-doctrine-20&quot;&gt;the Fairness Doctrine is back!&lt;/a&gt; Well, not the Fairness Doctrine itself, of course, but conservative paranoia that it&#39;s coming back any second now. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/huzzahmpls&quot;&gt;Via&lt;/a&gt; friend-of-blog John Anderson.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/3247851321444991316/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/dogs-not-barking.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/3247851321444991316'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/3247851321444991316'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/dogs-not-barking.html' title='Dogs, Not Barking'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-1911696621465663923</id><published>2013-12-11T07:50:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-11T07:50:53.579-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Congress"/><title type='text'>Read Stuff.

You “benefit,” by his way of thinking, only if your actuarial costs exceed your financial contributions. But that isn’t how most people think about insurance. Insurance isn’t a kind of gamble where you bet you can beat the house by consuming more in medical care than you pay in premiums and deductibles. It’s protection from risk. People like that protection. They will pay to acquire it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Yeah. I really do think that one thing that&#39;s happened in the continuing reaction to the ACA is that a lot of conservatives have convinced themselves that people don&#39;t really want health insurance after all -- that health insurance per se is some sort of liberal hoodwinking of an otherwise sensible popular. As far as I can tell, that&#39;s just simply not true. People do want insurance: old people, sick people, young people, healthy people. And, also as far as I can tell, they don&#39;t just want catastrophic protection; they want comprehensive, &quot;good,&quot; insurance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it&#39;s true that if it&#39;s too expensive, people won&#39;t buy it -- so questions about young healthies and death spirals are perfectly legitimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that legitimate question, as I read a lot of conservatives, seems to have transmogrified into skepticism of the entire idea of health insurance -- a refusal to believe the very obvious point that, as Chait says, people will pay to avoid risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Example? I see it in several of Ross Douthat&#39;s recent items, including today&#39;s (generally smart) comparison of Medicare Part D and the ACA. I basically agree with him about the rollout comparisons, but when it comes to ACA customers he just doesn&#39;t seem to see that the peace of mind insurance gives people is really a massive benefit, and therefore of course one should expect people to want (within reason) to pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or at least that&#39;s how I read Douthat and other smart conservatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also: nice catch!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/7474477769384677246/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/catch-of-day_10.html#comment-form' title='15 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/7474477769384677246'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/7474477769384677246'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/catch-of-day_10.html' title='Catch of the Day'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>15</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-7276093208508153459</id><published>2013-12-10T10:50:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-10T10:50:03.496-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Senate"/><title type='text'>Nuclear Fallout Update</title><content type='html'>While waiting for the budget deal, Senate Democrats are attempting to get through a bunch of nominations before the end of the session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Republicans this morning are forcing extra votes, with Mitch McConnell just now forcing a re-vote on the nuclear option -- that is, the new precedent that cloture on nominations only takes a simple majority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tell that it&#39;s all for show? Republicans did agree to the standard motion to allow committees to meet. If they really were going all-out to &quot;shut down the Senate,&quot; that&#39;s one they could have objected to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#39;ll see. Democrats have filed cloture petitions on ten new nominations -- that&#39;s in addition to Mel Watt (cloture to be voted on this morning) and the three DC Circuit nominees, the first of whom was confirmed this morning. Reid wants to run through all 14 of these, plus other less important exec branch nominations which typically would go by unanimous consent late in the session. If Republicans maximize stalling maneuvers, Reid can hold the Senate in later, threatening to take them to Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My strong guess is that Republicans will back off pretty quickly. Sure, they&#39;ll put up a little show of obstruction, but in this case resistance really is futile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reid has &lt;a href=&quot;http://democrats.senate.gov/2013/12/10/senate-floor-schedule-for-tuesday-december-10-2013/&quot;&gt;ordered his cloture petitions&lt;/a&gt; with the Homeland Security Secretary last, presumably because it&#39;s a more believable claim that he won&#39;t leave town until he gets to that one. Of course, he could be bluffing; if Republicans really do drag things out, he can always drop some of the intervening nominations. I doubt it, but I guess we&#39;ll see.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/7276093208508153459/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/nuclear-fallout-update.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/7276093208508153459'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/7276093208508153459'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/nuclear-fallout-update.html' title='Nuclear Fallout Update'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-2911943314270128319</id><published>2013-12-10T08:07:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-10T08:07:26.143-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="voters"/><title type='text'>Read Stuff, You Should</title><content type='html'>Happy Birthday to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0662921/&quot;&gt;Catherine Parks&lt;/a&gt;, 57. Why? Because she was in Bernie&#39;s, that&#39;s why. If that&#39;s not enough for you, she was on the Boat once...we really need someone to revive the Boat or something like it. On her episode? Bob Denver, Markie Post, Forrest Tucker, Lyle Waggoner...Eleanor Parker, who just died, who played the Baroness in Sound of Music, too. Back to Parks: if that&#39;s not enough, she was also in &quot;Looker.&quot; Why should anyone care about that stinker? Because it&#39;s also Susan Dey&#39;s birthday. But she wasn&#39;t in Bernie&#39;s, so I&#39;m less interested. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for getting lost there, but I do have a little good stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.

And I didn&#39;t get around to doing a HOF old-timers (or whatever they&#39;re calling it) ballot post this year...maybe I&#39;ll deal with the players on Friday. I support Marvin Miller, and probably don&#39;t support Steinbrenner. As far as the managers, I&#39;ve fallen hopelessly behind on the sabermetric literature on managers, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/12/the-cooperstown-three-and-evaluating-managers#.UqYA3frGuoU.twitter&quot;&gt;Scott Lemieux is up to date&lt;/a&gt;, and I see no reason to disagree with anything he says on this one. I&#39;m not really sure what I think of Torre as a manager, but I&#39;d vote for him as a player, so it&#39;s a moot point for me, and at worst he&#39;s a fringe HOFer as both a manager and a player. Cox is underrated; I always rooted against La Russa, but he&#39;s clearly deserving, too.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/2911943314270128319/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/read-stuff-you-should_10.html#comment-form' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/2911943314270128319'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/2911943314270128319'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/read-stuff-you-should_10.html' title='Read Stuff, You Should'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-802944122503086781</id><published>2013-12-09T16:44:00.001-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-09T16:44:11.727-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Democracy"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Supreme Court"/><title type='text'>Elsewhere: SCOTUS, ALEC, ACA, more</title><content type='html'>I did a radio spot on KPCC today on the question of whether Justices should retire strategically or not, and also on term limits for SCOTUS. I&#39;m still ambivalent on the latter; I think the last time I wrote about it I bailed by saying that since staggered 18 year terms aren&#39;t going to happen, I don&#39;t need a position on it. On balance, I think I&#39;m perhaps a bit more for than against, but I&#39;m really undecided. On the main point, however, I think it&#39;s pretty clear that if older justices want to preserve the principles they believe in during a time of strong partisan polarization, then they should retire strategically. Which means Ginsburg and Breyer should retire now -- if they care about what they&#39;ve worked for, as oppose to caring about doing the work. If you want to listen, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scpr.org/programs/airtalk/2013/12/06/35001/should-politics-dictate-when-supreme-court-justice/#comments&quot;&gt;link will be here&lt;/a&gt; when they post it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other recent ones:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/12/09/alec-and-democracy/&quot;&gt;ALEC and democracy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/12/06/no-a-republican-president-wont-sabotage-obamacare-well-mostly-not/?clsrd&quot;&gt;No, a Republican president won’t sabotage Obamacare.

The month before the shooting, Obama had won a convincing reelection and a modest popular mandate. One major liberal wish-list entry, immigration reform, seemed not only within reach but almost inevitable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Instead, not only in this story did Obama&#39;s gun control initiative sink immigration reform, but it derailed, at least so far, his entire second term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C&#39;mon. Let&#39;s see...this argument depends on a bunch of stuff: To begin with: that there&#39;s such a thing as a mandate (and that Obama had one on immigration), and that &quot;The first few months of any president&#39;s term, closest to their electoral win and furthest from the next congressional midterm, are usually the most fruitful.&quot; The latter holds for first terms, but as far as I know there&#39;s no similar evidence on second terms, and certainly not second terms which also yield continued divided government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For that matter, the list of reelections with continued divided government is a short one -- in the last hundred years, only 1956, 1972, 1984, and 1996 fit that category before 2012, and of those 1972 wasn&#39;t much of a test. I don&#39;t think it supports Seitz-Wald&#39;s point, either. Just looking at wikipedia...the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99th_United_States_Congress&quot;&gt;99th Congress&lt;/a&gt; didn&#39;t pass any major bills until December 1985, but passed several, including tax reform, in 1986. Tax reform is as good a comp as any. Reagan sent up his proposal in May 1985; Ways and Means marked up a bill in September through December, 1985 and it passed the House in the same month; Senate Finance finished their markup in May, 1986; the Senate passed it at the end of June; and then after a formal conference in July and August, both chambers passed the bill in September, 1986.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ike&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99th_United_States_Congress&quot;&gt;85th Congress&lt;/a&gt; did pass three major laws in 1955, but several more in 1956. As for Clinton, not too much happened in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/105th_United_States_Congress&quot;&gt;105th&lt;/a&gt; (although unlike in Ike&#39;s case, the second Congress of Clinton&#39;s second term was more productive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I think all this says is: the &quot;almost inevitable&quot; was an illusion. Presidents re-elected with continued divided government don&#39;t have a Hundred Days, and they basically don&#39;t pass partisan initiatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, to put it another way: whether immigration reform passed was always going to be about what mainstream House conservatives wanted, and they really don&#39;t care very much whether &lt;a href=&quot;http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/obama-job-approval&quot;&gt;Barack Obama&#39;s approval rating&lt;/a&gt; is at its honeymoon peak of around 51%, or if it&#39;s fallen to around 48% (post-gun bill), 46% (after the Senate passed immigration), or 41% (now). Now, if Obama was at 70% that might scare a few moderates, but that wasn&#39;t going to happen in winter and spring 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obama&#39;s second term legislative agenda was derailed on election night 2012 when Republicans retained the House. After that, it&#39;s just been a question of where to find a few productive compromises that work for both parties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More broadly, it&#39;s just not true that Congress, or even one chamber of Congress, can only do one thing at a time. Even when the bills are going to go through the same committees, it&#39;s actually perfectly possible for two or more bills to advance through the process together. Sure, small delays are possible if two bills reach the exact same stage at the exact same time, but usually that&#39;s not the case. The more likely explanation for the delay in the immigration bill -- just as with the ACA in 2009 -- is that it takes time for Congress to work its way through complex, contentious bills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pass it along: gun safety probably had no effect at all on the rest of Barack Obama&#39;s second term.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/4749526423633102749/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/gun-control-didnt-ruin-obamas-second.html#comment-form' title='11 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/4749526423633102749'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/4749526423633102749'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/gun-control-didnt-ruin-obamas-second.html' title='Gun Control Didn&#39;t Ruin Obama&#39;s Second Term'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>11</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-7243197085061249361</id><published>2013-12-09T11:12:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-09T11:12:01.130-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="budget"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="media"/><title type='text'>Catch of the Day</title><content type='html'>Kevin Drum is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/12/what-deficit-mania-doing-news-pages&quot;&gt;absolutely right in his response to Lori Montgomery&#39;s WaPo story today about budget negotiations&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;There&#39;s nothing wrong with talking about the federal deficit in a story about the budget. But this entire story is framed around a sense of dismay that Congress has &quot;abandoned&quot; its debt-reduction goals. This is done with no mention of the fact that Congress has already slashed the 10-year deficit by nearly $4 trillion over the past couple of years. No mention that we&#39;ve been engaged in this frenzy of deficit cutting despite the fact that the economy is still fragile, which means that reducing the deficit is almost certainly a terrible idea. No mention that deficit cutting of any size in the wake of recession is unprecedented in recent history.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Basically, there are two problems with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/budget-deal-expected-this-week-amounts-to-a-cease-fire-as-sides-move-to-avert-a-standoff/2013/12/08/cc270d90-600b-11e3-8beb-3f9a9942850f_story.html?hpid=z1&quot;&gt;Montgomery&#39;s piece&lt;/a&gt;. First, that she ignores previous deficit-cutting from this and previous Congresses; second, that he takes the position that deficit-cutting is unambiguously a good thing, now and always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll add one thing: she uses &quot;debt&quot; and &quot;deficit&quot; in ways that obscure what&#39;s going on. So, for example, she begins by saying the prospective deal would &quot;not significantly reduce the debt.&quot; Well, yes; that&#39;s not going to happen unless the government runs surpluses. While there are some who believe that would be a good idea, most economists, including many sincere deficit hawks (who do want both short and long-term deficits slashed), would not want the debt reduced next year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt Yglesias is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/12/09/deficit_reduction_as_a_rooting_interest_newspapers_are_weird.html&quot;&gt;on this too&lt;/a&gt;, and he&#39;s right also: &quot;Journalists who would never think of openly cheerleading for more people to get government-subsidized health insurance or for oil companies to secure a freer hand in drilling, regard the goodness of deficit reduction as a kind of non-ideological given.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yglesias asks why that&#39;s the case. My guess? Reagan. Because Ronald Reagan&#39;s policies produced huge deficits, and his influence pushed future Republicans to adopt policies which produced huge deficits, the Democratic Party shifted to a mostly fiscally conservative party. And yet because &lt;a href=&quot;http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2010/05/ronald-reagan-conservatives-and-willing.html&quot;&gt;Reagan&#39;s particular political genius&lt;/a&gt; lie in believing what he wanted to believe regardless of what was going on, under Reagan conservatives became even more rhetorically committed to balanced budgets and deficit obsession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which leaves both parties rhetorically, at least, committed to hating deficits and debt. And the norm for journalists is that if both parties support something, then it&#39;s okay to treat it as an unquestioned and unquestionable good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, there are plenty of liberals who don&#39;t always support balanced budgets, and a handful of conservatives who are honest about the effects of their policies. But on both sides, the bulk of the official messaging assumes that deficit reduction is always a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, it&#39;s possible that reporter love of deficit reduction precedes the partisan (rhetorical) consensus on deficit reduction, in which case it&#39;s possible that one reason the parties adopted that stance is because they believed it would play better in the press. (I suppose I should note here, too, FDR&#39;s 1932 anti-deficit campaign rhetoric). So perhaps a more careful examination of this is in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate: nice catch!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/7243197085061249361/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/catch-of-day_9.html#comment-form' title='33 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/7243197085061249361'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/7243197085061249361'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/catch-of-day_9.html' title='Catch of the Day'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>33</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-5114362445646800499</id><published>2013-12-09T08:11:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-09T08:11:09.862-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Democracy"/><title type='text'>Read Stuff, You Should</title><content type='html'>Happy Birthday to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Worf&quot;&gt;Michael Dorn&lt;/a&gt;, 61.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.

I was happy with Hudson. But I&#39;m really not happy at all with bringing Ryan Vogelsong back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with: he was awful in 2013. He was just fine in 2012, and quite good in 2011. So we&#39;re talking about a pitcher who will be 36 next year and, really, has very little chance of being better than league average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted: a low-priced league-average starting pitcher isn&#39;t a bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a team with four solid starters and a hole, and adding a cheap starter -- even one with a low ceiling -- makes a lot of sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Giants aren&#39;t that team. They&#39;re counting on a bounce-back season for Cain (seems likely), a bounce-back season from Hudson (somewhat less likely, but he needs less of a bounce-back), and a bounce-back season for Lincecum (really not all that likely).And that&#39;s just to get all of them to league-average. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To put it another way: the biggest problem with the Giants last year wasn&#39;t that they forgot to have a real left fielder; it was the starting pitching. And Sabean&#39;s plan is pretty much to hope that it was just an off year for everyone. Or two years, in some cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, to put it yet another way...Bumgarner and Cain could be quite good, but the other three spots now all have basically a league-average ceiling. Oh, you can make a case for Hudson to do better than that. But it&#39;s hard to see. And what&#39;s really easy for me to imagine is Vogelson puttering along, doing just well enough that he stays in the rotation despite actually hurting the team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t know...Vogelsong was a great fairy tale. A terrific story. But hoping that it repeats itself? It&#39;s really pushing things.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/7179935486449261633/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/friday-baseball-post.html#comment-form' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/7179935486449261633'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/7179935486449261633'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/friday-baseball-post.html' title='Friday Baseball Post'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-8581906164364461512</id><published>2013-12-06T10:04:00.001-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-06T10:04:47.229-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="health care"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="polling"/><title type='text'>Ignore Those Polls!</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iop.harvard.edu/majority-disapprove-health-care-law-believe-their-costs-will-rise-and-quality-will-fall&quot;&gt;The &quot;Millenials&quot; poll out earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; showing (among other things) younger people unenthusiastic about the ACA has sparked a fair amount of discussion, but there&#39;s one particular point I haven&#39;t seen made. I&#39;m highly suspicious of the reported finding that only a third of the uninsured from ages 18 through 29 intend to enroll through the exchanges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are just too many things out there for me to believe that there&#39;s any kind of predictable relationship between what they tell a pollster and what they&#39;ll actually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s see...first of all, I&#39;m pretty skeptical about asking the younger part of this cohort about personal intentions with regard to health insurance at all. Perhaps I find it hard to put myself in their shoes, since I was a full-time college student at that age and from a middle class family; I didn&#39;t have to think about health insurance at all until after graduation. At any rate, for those at ages 18 through 25, the survey asked what they would do &quot;after you are no longer eligible to stay on your parents plan.&quot; As far as I can tell from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iop.harvard.edu/sites/default/files_new/Harvard_TopLineDataFall2013_1.pdf&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;, that was used for everyone in that age range, regardless of whether they had insurance on a parent plan now. &amp;nbsp;If that&#39;s case, then I&#39;d suggest it&#39;s totally meaningless what a 18 year old tells a pollster she expects to do about obtaining health insurance over five years into the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there&#39;s the question of what they&#39;re signing up for. The poll used a split sample to ask about both &quot;Affordable Care Act&quot; and &quot;Obamacare,&quot; which is great. But there&#39;s no mention of Healthcare.gov in either case; instead, it refers to only &quot;government-run exchanges.&quot; I&#39;m really not confident that most young people know what that means -- or that they would need to in order to sign up. Then there&#39;s the issue of the state-run exchanges; people in Kentucky or California may believe that they&#39;re not signing up for &quot;Obamacare&quot; at all. It&#39;s also true, although again there&#39;s no way to know how it affects polling responses, that a fair number of uninsured young people will be eligible for expanded Medicaid. Would they say they are planning on using &quot;government-run exchanges&quot; or not? That&#39;s not even figuring out what to think about those who would be eligible for Medicaid but have the bad luck to be in Texas or some other state that didn&#39;t participate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing: even for those who are eligible for the exchanges now and understand what they are, it&#39;s still not clear how well what they tell pollsters of their intentions will match what they eventually do. Some may say they intend to sign up but then never get around to it, or start shopping and then decide it&#39;s a bad deal for them. Others may not intend to and then find out that subsidies make it a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess is that for most young people, at some point they&#39;ll confront the question of &quot;how do I get health insurance?&quot; for the first time -- in many cases, because &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/12/05/why-millennials-will-come-around-on-obamacare/&quot;&gt;a parent is nagging them about it&lt;/a&gt; -- and unless they have employment-linked coverage, the answer is going to be to go to Healthcare.gov or their state exchange. And, yeah, it won&#39;t really feel like signing up for Obamacare; it&#39;s just going to be how you get (private) health insurance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which, I should add, is not a prediction about how many will sign up and at what age, and how that will affect the overall pool (and thus the degree to which the ACA exchanges work or don&#39;t work).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I don&#39;t think the poll tells us anything about what young people are going to do when they get to that point of seeking insurance. General point: be very suspicious any time people answer polling question about intentions they might not have had until they were asked. Ignore those polls!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/8581906164364461512/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/ignore-those-polls.html#comment-form' title='15 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/8581906164364461512'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/8581906164364461512'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/ignore-those-polls.html' title='Ignore Those Polls!'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>15</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-6053550747065503541</id><published>2013-12-06T08:00:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-06T08:00:17.869-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Iran"/><title type='text'>Read Stuff, You Should</title><content type='html'>Happy Birthday to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allmusic.com/artist/pixies-mn0000895136&quot;&gt;David Lovering&lt;/a&gt;, 52.

Acknowledging past errors is absolutely admirable.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I hope I&#39;m not being too crass by saying that, alas, Cillizza still doesn&#39;t really get it right. The problem is that he sets it all up as a story about the Democrats and about Harry Reid in particular. Back in July, he argued that Senate Majority Leaders by their nature were always going to seek to preserve, not blow up, the institution; now, he thinks that the key thing he missed then were all the new Democratic Senators who never served in the minority and therefore were less committed to preserving Senate traditional protections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t think he gets Reid wrong (although he might have put more weight on the side of Reid that&#39;s all about being a tough partisan fighter), and he&#39;s right that there was a clear pattern of more senior Democrats being the most reluctant to pull the trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should get to the point: what Cillizza gets wrong, both in July and now, is that the key players here weren&#39;t Reid and the Democrats; this was all about the Republicans. As I&#39;ve said many times, there&#39;s always going to be a tension between what&#39;s best for Senators as individual Senators, and what&#39;s best for them as party members. The more the minority obstructs, the more that party incentive kicks in. As obstruction ratcheted up in the 1990s, 2000s, and then the Obama era, it&#39;s not clear exactly where the line is where the party incentive clearly takes over, but it&#39;s certain that &quot;nullification&quot; obstruction was solidly over that line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a while for nullification obstruction of executive branch positions produced an ultimatum and a showdown, but that&#39;s what this summer&#39;s confrontation was about. Since Republicans backed down, Democrats didn&#39;t have to follow through. When Republicans then extended nullification obstruction to judges, Democrats predictably reacted with a new ultimatum, and had little choice but to follow through when Republicans this time did not retreat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed: what happened during the original nuclear confrontation, over appellate judges during the George W. Bush presidency, is that Democrats mostly backed down. In other words, one could argue that in that case, too, the key was the minority party -- first in ratcheting up obstruction, and then in backing down when it resulted in a nuclear threat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, the majority isn&#39;t totally passive, and isn&#39;t purely just reacting. It&#39;s certainly possible that a more senior group of Democratic Senators might have been more patient at the end. But any analysis that doesn&#39;t mainly focus on the unprecedented obstruction of the Obama era is really just missing the biggest part of the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*And, again very much to his credit, it&#39;s something he does all the time. I thought that I had written something about Cillizza&#39;s claim back in July and went &lt;a href=&quot;http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/search?q=cillizza&quot;&gt;hunting&lt;/a&gt; for all the things I&#39;ve written about him here, and while I found a lot of pretty harsh crankiness (he seems to have been one of the first inspirations for Cranky Blogging), I also found several times he was featured in &quot;Read Stuff&quot; for good pieces -- and, in particular, good pieces in which he looked at criticism of things he had written and decided the critics had a point. So being open about his mistakes is nothing new for Cillizza. It&#39;s an absolutely great but fairly rare quality for any pundit or reporter, or for that matter anyone, I suppose.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/2050584902799514804/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/going-nuclear-was-about-republicans-not.html#comment-form' title='6 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/2050584902799514804'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/2050584902799514804'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/going-nuclear-was-about-republicans-not.html' title='Going Nuclear Was About Republicans, Not Democrats'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-6227020257297074452</id><published>2013-12-05T08:43:00.002-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-05T10:29:11.432-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014 cycle"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="economy"/><title type='text'>Read Stuff, You Should</title><content type='html'>Happy Birthday to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0664175/&quot;&gt;Jessica Pare&lt;/a&gt;, 31.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And very quickly, some good stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/04/the-best-speech-obama-has-given-on-the-economy/&quot;&gt;Barack Obama&#39;s speech on the economy&lt;/a&gt; -- which Ezra Klein calls his best on that subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.

But I&#39;d like to see the filibuster saved and I think it&#39;s not only possible but actually in the interest of all Senators, so I&#39;ll push on with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, as I argued &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salon.com/2013/11/23/why_we_should_save_the_filibuster/&quot;&gt;a while ago&lt;/a&gt;, I think that the filibuster (and the good things about the Senate) has a better chance of surviving long-term if the current post-nuclear situation is replaced by a negotiated settlement on nominations. The key is to get both sides to agree to something which would be better for the minority party than the post-nuclear status quo, but better for the majority party than where things were before Harry Reid acted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In particular, I think simple majority cloture on judges is suboptimal. As long as we&#39;re talking lifetime appointments, I have no real problem with imposing some sort of supermajority requirement. When I&#39;ve written about this in the past, I&#39;ve always said that I had no particular attachment to 60, but I&#39;ve never really had any particular notion of why any particular number should be set as the standard. So, futile as it is, I&#39;m going to return to it with a new argument: the number required for cloture should be pegged to the size of the Senate majority party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, actually, because as long as they&#39;re (hypothetically) revisiting the rule, they should set it to the size of the Senate minority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most obvious option for the number needed to sustain a filibuster would be equal to the size of the minority party. So, with 45 Republicans right now, continuing a filibuster would require 45 &quot;yea&quot; votes. What does that do? It means that if the opposition party is unified in rejecting a judicial nominee, then Senators from the president&#39;s party may have a tough vote. If the nominee is relatively popular, no problem. If not, then, well, that&#39;s as good a sign as any that the nominee is in some way unfit or out of the mainstream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, normally we could assume that any party which wins the White House and also wins the Senate -- the conditions under which any of this matters -- will be able to produce judicial nominees who are at least avoid being dramatically unpopular. In fact, all else equal, there&#39;s no reason to expect that they&#39;ll be unpopular at all. But given the loose connection between opinion on public policy and elections, it&#39;s certainly possible, especially if the president actively attempts to fill the bench with ideologues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other variations: one could set it at minority plus two. With a 45 member Republican conference, they would need 47 votes to sustain a filibuster. That makes cloture quite a bit easier; only a truly unpopular nominee would likely lose. Or set it at minority minus two. That way, the majority would have to win at least two minority party votes for cloture (assuming everyone was present and the majority party was united). As we&#39;ve seen, however, that option may be good for the minority party as a whole, but can force tough choices for Senators who don&#39;t want to obstruct but also don&#39;t want to be seen as squishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, in some ways keeping the number exactly equal to the size of the minority party takes the pressure off them, and puts the pressure on marginal Senators from the majority party. In exchange, of course, at least as opposed to 60, the majority party would normally be able to confirm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the exact number, presumably it would be capped at 60 (so a 65 Senators majority party would be able to easily get cloture). I suppose it would have to be drafted carefully to prevent gaming the system (the minority party couldn&#39;t change the number by having a half-dozen Senators declare themselves Independents); that seems doable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, some majorities would find it a lot easier to stick together than others. If the president&#39;s party has a couple of Senators who normally vote with the out-party on judicial issues, it&#39;s going to be harder to get cloture. But that was true under the old rules, too. Remember, it&#39;s been rare even in the last two Congresses for Republicans to unanimously oppose cloture on judicial nominees; that may change some with only a simple majority needed for cloture and could change under any set of rules, but if things break down the majority still could threatened a new round of majority-imposed reform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again: I don&#39;t expect to see this happen, mainly because I don&#39;t think Republicans are willing to compromise; I think they would rather get rolled than cut a deal. Democrats might not take it either. But I still think it&#39;s a deal that works for both sides, and for the Senate.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/8076008642924807599/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/still-hoping-to-save-filibuster.html#comment-form' title='5 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/8076008642924807599'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/8076008642924807599'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/still-hoping-to-save-filibuster.html' title='Still Hoping to Save the Filibuster'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-4679871460726756961</id><published>2013-12-04T13:17:00.001-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-04T13:17:13.136-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="health care"/><title type='text'>HealthCare.gov, Amazon, and Health Care as Normal Politics</title><content type='html'>I made the point yesterday that what we&#39;re starting to see is the re-emergence of health care as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/12/03/health-care-reemerges-as-a-normal-issue/?clsrd&quot;&gt;normal political issue&lt;/a&gt;, along with the end fight over passing and then repealing the ACA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that&#39;s the right lens through which to understand the conversation about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115815/why-healthcaregov-not-amazoncom-should-we-care&quot;&gt;remaining visible problems at Healthcare.gov&lt;/a&gt;. as discussed by Jonathan Cohn and others. Philip Klein, &lt;a href=&quot;http://washingtonexaminer.com/no-obamacare-isnt-fixed/article/2539974&quot;&gt;criticizing the improved web site&lt;/a&gt;, noted that it still compares unfavorably to typical commercial sites; Cohn considers the evidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#39;s the thing, though. None of this has anything at all to do with the &quot;success&quot; or &quot;failure&quot; of the ACA. Yes, if Amazon was down every night for scheduled repairs and then occasionally the rest of the time, Amazon wouldn&#39;t last long. But, as I said the other day, not a single state motor vehicle registration or driver&#39;s licence program has every failed because local DMVs are typically a mess.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t matter, going forward, whether Healthcare.gov is well-run or not. It&#39;s just that it will be a normal political issue. No different from whether the VA is well-run, or whether Pentagon procurement wastes a ton of money or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m confident that&#39;s true of front-end problems. I think it&#39;s probably true of back-end problems, at least within reason. Yes, it&#39;s going to be a big deal for the individual people involved if a small percentage of customers have miscalculated subsidies, or if the insurance company they thought they signed up for doesn&#39;t ever hear about it. It&#39;s the kind of mismanagement scandal that can and should create big headaches for an administration. But it&#39;s not the kind of thing that causes a government program to &quot;fail&quot; or to be repealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose there might be some level at which things are so bad that customers really don&#39;t show up, or at least that effects are more than at the margins. But fundamentally, people want health insurance, and Healthcare.gov (and the state exchanges) are where people are going to go if they&#39;re on the individual market. Whether it&#39;s relatively easy or relatively difficult.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again: I&#39;m not saying that mismanagement at Healthcare.gov is a non-issue. It&#39;s absolutely an issue, and a big story. It&#39;s just almost certainly a normal politics story about how well (or badly) government is working. It may even be a part of the story of the next generation of government health care reform. It&#39;s just not part of a battle over the survival or repeal of the ACA, because that battle ended a while ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Is this no longer true, by the way? And is the reputation no longer true, regardless of the facts? My last experience in Texas -- in a newly opened office -- was just fine, and a few years ago I had an excellent customer experience in Indiana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Old guy moment: I was going to say: just as people shop at malls even if they hate malls, because that&#39;s where the stores are. Dated! And, yeah, maybe the miserable experience many people believed that circa-1980s shopping malls gave them had a lot to do with the demise of malls. But not before an awful lot of stuff was purchased.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/4679871460726756961/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/healthcaregov-amazon-and-health-care-as.html#comment-form' title='12 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/4679871460726756961'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/4679871460726756961'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/healthcaregov-amazon-and-health-care-as.html' title='HealthCare.gov, Amazon, and Health Care as Normal Politics'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>12</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-1415383316819078213</id><published>2013-12-04T08:02:00.001-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-04T08:02:28.583-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="health care"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Presidency"/><title type='text'>Read Stuff, You Should</title><content type='html'>Happy Birthday to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/willije01.shtml&quot;&gt;Jerome Williams&lt;/a&gt;, 32.

More &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/12/green-lantern-aca-addendum&quot;&gt;on ACA, Obama, and the presidency&lt;/a&gt; from Scott Lemieux. By the way: I&#39;m open to arguments that Obama (and Waxman, and Pelosi, and Dodd, and Harkin) could have done marginally better overall, if &quot;better&quot; is defined as getting more of what they were fighting for. My overall assessment, however, is that there was a lot more downside than there was upside; the whole thing could definitely collapsed, but better presidenting would have made very small differences. As for the question of how much agency Obama had...yes, he certainly could have pulled the plug at a few key points. But I strongly suspect that the incentives were overwhelmingly in the direction he wound up in, and that pretty much any plausible Democratic president would have gone down (and stayed on) the same path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.

Intellectual consistency is a basic value for political commentators. You want to be sure your strongly held views are the product of an actual philosophy, because the temptation to see events through the prism of partisan bias is strong.&lt;/blockquote&gt;He says this to put the hurt on Charles Krauthammer&#39;s flip on the filibuster and the nuclear option between the Bush-era Senate showdown and the recent Obama-era version. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intellectual consistency is a basic value, perhaps, for some political commentators. But I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s necessary for all political commentators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put it this way. I might read Chait because I care what Jonathan Chait thinks about things. In fact, I do; he&#39;s a smart guy, and a fun writer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one also might seek out political commentators in order to hear the best, good-faith arguments for and against something that&#39;s in the news. For that, I want someone who reliably supports one side of the partisan divide (or perhaps one ideological strain). I still don&#39;t want phony arguments; that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t title this &quot;In Defense of Krauthammer,&quot; because I generally don&#39;t think he supplies strong, honest arguments. There&#39;s still a requirement for serious intellectual integrity, even for partisan arguments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Chait is talking about something like a &quot;public intellectual&quot; model, and what I&#39;d say is that there&#39;s also room for a lawyer model. For a lawyer-model pundit, it doesn&#39;t matter so much if she said the exact opposite thing five years ago, but it still matters a lot if she gets her facts right and makes well-reasoned, well-informed, arguments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the question is whether there&#39;s really any need for lawyer-style commentators, given that it&#39;s the professional responsibility of many politicians to essentially do that. I&#39;d say: sure. Commentators, as opposed to politicians or their staff, are relatively free to make the argument properly, without having to worry about the political fallout from the various speed traps and potholes that politicians have to shy away from -- or from winning daily spin wars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, it&#39;s unlikely that anyone is going to identify himself as a lawyer-style commentator. And yes, one tip-off that Krauthammer isn&#39;t worth bothering with is his extreme certainty that he&#39;s correct, even as (as Chait notes) he flips from one side to another of an issue based on partisan tides. But overall, there&#39;s probably a lot more room for good lawyer-style pundits than Chait thinks.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/7740819612362249217/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/in-defense-of-partisan-hack-pundits.html#comment-form' title='13 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/7740819612362249217'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/7740819612362249217'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/in-defense-of-partisan-hack-pundits.html' title='In Defense of Partisan Hack Pundits'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>13</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-8916441683823809910</id><published>2013-12-03T11:42:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-03T12:13:47.009-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2008 cycle"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="health care"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Obama"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Presidency"/><title type='text'>Catch of the Day</title><content type='html'>To Scott Lemieux for (once again) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/12/post-political-critiques-of-post-political-politics&quot;&gt;shooting down liberal fantasies&lt;/a&gt; that the only thing preventing Congress from passing single-payer health care insurance in 2009-2010 was a failure of will from the president.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s an excellent job, and sadly necessary, over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One key point that Lemieux doesn&#39;t mention this time: in one sense, this really isn&#39;t about 2009 at all. It&#39;s about 2007 and 2008, when the three leading Democratic presidential candidates converged on essentially the same plan (with Obama famously omitting the individual mandate). That says a lot. It says that none of those three candidates believed that adopting single-payer would have given them a serious edge in a closely contested nomination fight -- and that no other candidate was able to leap to the top tier by embracing single-payer. In other words, it tells us that in the world of 2007-2008, at least, the ACA was mainstream within the actual Democratic Party as it was, and single-payer was a fringe position in the actual Democratic Party as it was. Maybe lots and lots of Democrats preferred single-payer in some sense, but virtually none of them, either elites or electorates, did anything about it. And that&#39;s what counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this also means is that ACA vs. single-payer had &lt;i&gt;virtually nothing to do with Barack Obama himself&lt;/i&gt;. And so Obama-centric explanations for it are clearly, 100%, wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;d further argue, although here it&#39;s not quite as clear, that there was very little about the way that Obama fought for the ACA that had much to do with Obama himself. Yes, a Hillary Clinton WH would have looked a little different from the Obama WH...but not all that very different. Yes, presidents themselves do make key decisions, and not their staff or their party. But not only are they often severely constrained by their party (and by Congress, and by lots of other things), but they&#39;re also highly influenced by the incentives of the job, and those are the same whether we&#39;re talking Obama, Clinton, or George W. Bush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, there&#39;s an excellent chance that both the good and bad outcomes on health care reform would have wound up more or less the same whether the winner of the 2008 Democratic nomination was Obama, or Hillary, or a hypothetically unscandaled John Edwards, or for that matter John Kerry or Al Gore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile: nice catch!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/8916441683823809910/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/catch-of-day.html#comment-form' title='14 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/8916441683823809910'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/8916441683823809910'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/catch-of-day.html' title='Catch of the Day'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>14</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-4418885779417672477</id><published>2013-12-03T08:04:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-03T08:04:41.233-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="health care"/><title type='text'>Read Stuff, You Should</title><content type='html'>Happy Birthday to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/berryda01.shtml&quot;&gt;Damon Berryhill&lt;/a&gt;, 50.

But the one thing I left out that I really want to get to is yet another myth about a previous president.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, not the one about second-term presidents never recovering if their approval sinks; I saw that again today, but I&#39;ve already handled that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/191683-dems-admit-reboot-needs-stronger-team&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; (my emphasis):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;“I don’t know where the breakdown occurred on that, but it’s Obama’s ‘no new taxes’ moment,” the official said, referring to &lt;i&gt;the broken promise that is widely seen as having cost President George H.W. Bush a second term.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Hogwash! What cost George H.W. Bush a second term was a poorly timed recession. That&#39;s all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bush breaking his tax pledge was a story in June through October 1990. Look at his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gallup.com/poll/124922/Presidential-Approval-Center.aspx&quot;&gt;approval ratings&lt;/a&gt;: it&#39;s hard to make much of it. In particular, this all happened before the Gulf War, which relegated it to ancient history. One can argue that it hurt Bush in the long run by destroying trust in him, but that certainly didn&#39;t seem to have any effect at all in spring 1991. Only when the economy turned south did his approval ratings follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that for the neutral press, this is a close relative of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salon.com/2011/04/04/third_party_myth_easterbrook/&quot;&gt;equally untrue myth that Ross Perot cost Bush the election&lt;/a&gt;. Why? Because after three consecutive solid Republican victories, by 1992 most Republicans believed the myth of a GOP &quot;electoral lock&quot; and therefore were open to bogus explanations of something which actually didn&#39;t need much explanation at all beyond the obvious one that incumbent presidents usually lose re-election if there&#39;s a recession in the second half of their term. What distinguishes this one, I&#39;m sure, is that a faction of the Republican Party is intensely interested in convincing everyone that higher taxes ruined Bush&#39;s presidency, while pretty much no one else cares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, at best breaking the pledge was a very minor factor in the 1992 election, and most likely it had no effect at all. Moreover, to the extent that it hurt at all, it may well have been because of how central, high-profile, and specific the pledge was in Bush&#39;s 1988 campaign. I&#39;d guess it&#39;s easily in the top 1% of all campaign pledges ever if all those factors are combined, and pretty high up there as far as how high-profile and absolute the breaking of it was. Really, however, it likely made no difference at all in 1992.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/4822480288263959839/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/myths-myths-myths.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/4822480288263959839'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/4822480288263959839'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/myths-myths-myths.html' title='Myths, Myths, Myths'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-5183194822456342595</id><published>2013-12-02T13:10:00.002-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-02T13:10:36.633-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="health care"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="public opinion"/><title type='text'>Hey, Pollsters!</title><content type='html'>Three topics I&#39;d love to know more about:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. How many people know that Healthcare.gov is Obamacare? Especially the people who actually use it. Also, the associated questions: how many know that it&#39;s the Affordable Care Act, and how many know that there&#39;s more to the ACA than the exchanges? I&#39;m assuming that the number of people who associate Healthcare.gov with Obamacare is higher than it would have been if it had worked smoothly from the start...I&#39;d expect the number to be relatively high now, and start to shrink as time goes on. But either way, I&#39;d love to know about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. How many people know that the US is still involved in a shooting war in Afghanistan? How many know that the US is no longer involved in a shooting war in Iraq? I saw another reference today somewhere to &quot;two wars&quot;...I suppose that might have meant Afghanistan and the general &quot;war on terror,&quot; or it could have been just a error while writing quickly, or that there was an implicit &quot;over the last decade&quot; that I didn&#39;t read properly, but really I have no idea. I&#39;m fairly certain that some people think the US is still occupying Iraq, and that some people don&#39;t know there are still US troops (and US casualties) in Afghanistan, but whether it&#39;s a tiny fraction or something more substantial? I have no idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. An old standby: What do people mean when they talk about the &quot;deficit&quot;? Or, to put it another way: what do people hear when pollsters ask them about the deficit?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally: I find myself curious about political knowledge (in the electorate, but sometimes among elites) at least as often as I am curious about political opinions. That might just be because there&#39;s plenty of available information about opinions and much less about knowledge; I can&#39;t tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/18/wasteful-spending-poll_n_2886081.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000008&quot;&gt;This worked once!&lt;/a&gt; So: Hey, pollsters: I bet I&#39;m not the only one curious about these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/5183194822456342595/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/hey-pollsters.html#comment-form' title='7 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/5183194822456342595'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/5183194822456342595'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/hey-pollsters.html' title='Hey, Pollsters!'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>7</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-5736949190440086873</id><published>2013-12-02T10:20:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-02T10:20:02.709-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="health care"/><title type='text'>Repeal is Still Dead</title><content type='html'>A few bullet points on health care reform at the start of December...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The brutal truth of &quot;repeal&quot; is that whatever the politics, every day a flat-out repeal of the ACA becomes more and more nonsensical. The status quo ante no longer exists; changing the law back to how it was in 2009 wouldn&#39;t bring back the health care situation that existed then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Hey, health care wonks! I&#39;ve been using this line about how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/11/01/the-gop-push-for-obamacare-repeal-is-dead/&quot;&gt;repeal no longer makes policy sense&lt;/a&gt; for some time now, but while I&#39;m confident that&#39;s correct, I&#39;m certainly not enough of a health care wonk to write up all the details that make a return (via repeal) to 2009 just plain gibberish -- what I called the Humpty-Dumptyness of the situation. Someone want to take a crack at it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It&#39;s also true, as Brian Beutler &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salon.com/2013/12/02/r_i_p_obamacare_repeal_movement_crusade_is_officially_dead/&quot;&gt;says today&lt;/a&gt; (and Kevin Drum &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/11/obamacare-done-deal&quot;&gt;said last week&lt;/a&gt;) that in simple political terms flat-out repeal is less and less plausible every day, with more and more people having insurance through the exchanges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*All of which is to say that the US health care system has now been (almost) fully Obamacare-ized, and future changes will build on the ACA. That might even had been true after a GOP landslide in 2012, but it&#39;s certainly true now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Which in turn means that radicals who insist that Republicans who deviate at all from the hard-line repeal message are asking those Republicans to (continue to) absent themselves from the real debate over what&#39;s next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Of course, that would be less true if there really was a Republican alternative to the ACA -- if &quot;repeal and replace&quot; had ever become a true alternative. But even so, any alternative to Obamacare will, at this point, have to build on Obamacare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It also means that all-or-nothing assessments of the ACA (or of Healthcare.gov) are not only inaccurate, but particularly unhelpful because nothing is really at stake in whether the law &quot;succeeds&quot; or &quot;fails.&quot; What matters is what current, Obamacare-ized health care does well, does not so well, and does badly, and what new laws/regulations/practices can help where improvements are needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Yes, I did try to come up with an appropriate Humpty Dance title for this one, but alas I couldn&#39;t make it work. Partially because I don&#39;t mean to imply that post-ACA health care is broken; what I mean, as I hope is clear, is that the status quo ante can&#39;t be put back together again. But mostly because I couldn&#39;t find the right quote...I could, however, have opened with &quot;Stop whatcha doin&#39; &#39;cause I&#39;m about to ruin the image and the style that ya used to.&quot;)</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/5736949190440086873/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/repeal-is-still-dead.html#comment-form' title='8 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/5736949190440086873'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/5736949190440086873'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/repeal-is-still-dead.html' title='Repeal is Still Dead'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-5958140542725588742</id><published>2013-12-02T08:02:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2013-12-02T08:02:44.946-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="health care"/><title type='text'>Read Stuff, You Should</title><content type='html'>Happy Birthday to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005154/&quot;&gt;Lucy Liu&lt;/a&gt;, 45. The hardest thing about getting Holmes right has to be the precise gradation of just how smart he is. Too smart and there&#39;s no drama (or else you need to keep coming up with cheats, and what&#39;s the point of that?). Not smart enough, and why are we watching? I think Sherlock set it a bit too high, and Elementary just a tad too low. Two first-rate Watsons, though, although I&#39;m a die-hard Nigel Bruce fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey, it&#39;s Monday, isn&#39;t it? How about some good stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Scott Porch with suggestions about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-porch/the-moneyball-campaign_b_4331950.html&quot;&gt;how campaign coverage could improve&lt;/a&gt; if the media took findings from political science seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. John Sides is correct that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2013/12/01/hillary-clinton-does-not-need-to-rebuild-her-standing-among-black-voters/&quot;&gt;analysis of nomination politics should distinguish between elite and mass opinion&lt;/a&gt;. The important thing to note is that at this point (and throughout the invisible primary, at least), it&#39;s elite opinion that matters. If a politician is popular among the rank-and-file of some group but unpopular among opinion leaders for that group, the odds are strong that by Iowa, he or she will be unpopular among that group&#39;s voters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Good Paul Kane overview of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/113th-congress-going-down-in-history-for-its-inaction-has-a-critical-december-to-do-list/2013/12/01/cf2b4808-57a0-11e3-8304-caf30787c0a9_story.html&quot;&gt;what the pathetic 113th has on its to-do list for December&lt;/a&gt; -- and exactly how pathetic this session of Congress has been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Sarah Kliff &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/01/the-white-house-says-it-met-its-obamacare-goal-theres-still-more-work-ahead/&quot;&gt;on &quot;vast majority&quot; day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. And Philip Klein &lt;a href=&quot;http://washingtonexaminer.com/no-obamacare-isnt-fixed/article/2539974&quot;&gt;with a critique&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, I think his criticisms of the consumer experience are not unreasonable, but probably mostly irrelevant; most state DMVs had terrible service, but very few people decided to pass on getting a license because of it. On the other hand, the back-end problems...that&#39;s the critical question, and I agree with him (and Kliff) that we just have very little idea of what&#39;s going on -- and there&#39;s a scary possibility that no one will know what&#39;s going on until more people get through the system (which should happen in the next few weeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.

Exciting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#39;s worth: the problem was in the initial family information, towards the end. It asked about whether my eldest was a full-time student (she is), and then whether she had a parent in the same state in which she attends school (she doesn&#39;t), and then it couldn&#39;t save and continue after I answered it. Now? It can. I was able to complete the family information. Next step is income, and I wasn&#39;t prepared for it last night, so I bailed; I&#39;ll try to continue sometime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Realistic interpretation: It&#39;s silly to try to extrapolate from one customer&#39;s experience to anything at all about the system. The odds that I&#39;ll finish the process and actually have exchange-purchased health insurance are definitely much higher now, but what that says about anything else is probably a stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pessimistic interpretation: this is one small glitch which probably applied to a handful of people, and isn&#39;t really related to the big-deal back-end problems (correctly calculating subsidies, communicating accurately with health insurance companies) which could cause massive and serious problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Optimistic interpretation: if they got around to fixing my glitch, which probably applies to a tiny handful of people, then there&#39;s a good chance they&#39;re doing an even better job of dealing with the big-deal back-end problems which could cause massive and serious problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The correct one is...the realistic interpretation, of course. There&#39;s really no way to know what it means that one customer was able to get through one glitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, they&#39;re definitely improving it: logging in has been easy for weeks now after being on-and-off for a while, for example. On the other hand, they claim that response time is better; maybe it is, but the &quot;save and continue&quot; function is still very slow (and the system is designed to force a &quot;save and continue&quot; frequently, so putting in all family information for a four-person family takes quite some time). And I&#39;ve only just now completed the first step, so I have no idea how the next parts will go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, my glitch is fixed!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/958374632425901633/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/my-glitch-is-fixed.html#comment-form' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/958374632425901633'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/958374632425901633'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/12/my-glitch-is-fixed.html' title='My Glitch is Fixed!'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-1208103329940954547</id><published>2013-11-30T09:44:00.001-06:00</published><updated>2013-11-30T09:44:27.030-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="health care"/><title type='text'>What Mattered This Week?</title><content type='html'>Not much up on a Thanksgiving week.

One week more, and...it&#39;s disappearing even more. In the Gallup weekly reports, Obama trickled down to 40% approval overall after three weeks at 41%, but his approval among Hispanic citizens is up for the third week in a row and now stands at 54%, 14 points higher than his overall rating. That&#39;s consistent with where he was back in September (that is, it&#39;s down, but not down more than the overall dip).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It&#39;s certainly possible that there&#39;s something going on here, but it&#39;s also possible, and perhaps a bit more likely, that the earlier dip never actually happened. It was just a bit of random variation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I wanted to post on this not to beat up on the same thing, but because there&#39;s one additional point I didn&#39;t mention which is actually pretty important. Gallup publishes, in their weekly reports, a colossal 41 different splits. Look: flip a single coin 1000 times, and if heads comes up 600 times, something is probably going on. But what you&#39;re doing here is walking into a coin flipping factory, with some flipped 1000 times, and some 100 times, and some only 10 times, and yeah, if all you are doing are looking for oddball results then you&#39;re going to find what you&#39;re looking for.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And so, like clockwork, we have another reporter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NKingofDC/status/405105717767454721&quot;&gt;tweeting out&lt;/a&gt; that &quot;Obama&#39;s approval has dropped the sharpest among Eastern wealthy post-grads.&quot; Give it a rest, folks: just don&#39;t trust these blips in the crosstabs. There&#39;s no way of knowing whether they&#39;re real or not.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/3824164693356242931/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/one-more-time-on-subsamples-ignore.html#comment-form' title='6 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/3824164693356242931'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/3824164693356242931'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/one-more-time-on-subsamples-ignore.html' title='One More Time on Subsamples (Ignore Those Polls!

I cannot for the life of me understand why --- given the shining example of majority-rule just a football field south of the Senate --- they do not understand that there are both positive and negative consequences to doing so.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I think I know the answer to this one, although I&#39;ll admit it&#39;s speculative. And the answer is...political culture. Or, if you prefer, poor education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, there&#39;s incredibly widespread belief about two things in the US, one which confuses us and one which is just plain false:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Democracy is the best system of government (sometimes, but not always, with the Churchill qualifier; sometimes, especially these days among conservatives, with an essentially nonsense distinction between &quot;republic&quot; and &quot;democracy&quot;); and,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. &amp;nbsp;In democracies, decisions are made by majority vote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That the first of these is virtually uncontested winds up with everyone believing that whatever reforms they support make things more democratic. This matters because it gets in the way of clear thinking about what democracy actually is, since it becomes whatever it is we think best. It is, however, not actually true. Some of us have other things we care about; for example, we might care more about policy outcomes than the system of government that achieves them. It&#39;s OK that we&#39;re not all committed to democracy above all else; it would help us talk about this stuff if we were willing to accept that (and, in turn, accept that democracy isn&#39;t &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0533453/trivia?tab=qt&amp;amp;ref_=tt_trv_qu&quot;&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &quot;[t]he good guys are always stalwart and true. The bad guys are easily distinguished by their pointy horns or black hats, and, uh, we always defeat them and save the day&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second one is just plain wrong. At best, a pure, strict, majoritarian democracy is one of the many varieties of democracy, and not one that many democratic theorists (or, for that matter, democratic polities) actually subscribe to. But there are plenty of other forms of democracy. As always, I turn to Hannah Arendt on the difference between majority decision and majority rule:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;...we commonly equate and confound majority rule with majority decision. &amp;nbsp;The latter, however, is a technical device...In America, at any rate [the Constitution was] framed with the express and conscious intention to prevent, as far as humanly possible, the procedures of majority decisions from generating into the &quot;elective despotism&quot; of majority rule (On Revolution, 164-165, or at least it was in the old editions).&lt;/blockquote&gt;We adopt the &quot;technical device&quot; of majority voting often -- not always -- because it works well enough in many instances. That&#39;s just fine. But thinking that the goal is majority rule, and that the job of democratic design is to find procedures to empower one particular majority as much as possible, is totally backwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of which is to say whether majority voting is appropriate in any particular situation, or to ignore that the Constitution has plenty of anti-majoritiarian mechanisms which certainly matter in the question of what Senate procedures are more or less democratic. It&#39;s just that I think basic democratic (mis)education in the US far too often equates democracy with majority rule, and leaves people believing that these questions are obvious and easy.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth? Democracy doesn&#39;t always produce the substantive outcomes we want. And: democracy is more complex than just taking a vote and whoever gets the most votes, wins. That your grade school teachers (and, I&#39;m afraid, many of your college professors) didn&#39;t explain that to you is too bad, but it is nevertheless the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*OK, I spent way to much time trying to work &quot;lie to me&quot; into that paragraph, and I&#39;ll just settle for this footnote...basically, we watched that episode again last night, and as usual it&#39;s with me all day today.

That change doesn&#39;t clearly favor Democrats or Republicans. Rather, &lt;i&gt;it favors majorities over minorities&lt;/i&gt;. And a corrective on that front has been overdue for decades. The only thing worse than a Senate where the majority has the power to govern is one where it doesn&#39;t.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I&#39;m going to keep banging this one in, because it&#39;s terribly important. Removing the filibuster doesn&#39;t favor &quot;majorities.&quot; It favors one particular majority. Not a policy majority. The party majority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, nominations that the majority party in the Senate opposes won&#39;t necessarily make it to the Senate floor in the first place, even if they would actually win if they came to a vote. Indeed, one can imagine a House-like Senate refusing to bring nominees up for a vote unless a majority of the majority party favors it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Majorities&quot;? There&#39;s a majority right now for ENDA in the House, most observers believe. There&#39;s almost certainly a majority for a Senate-like immigration bill. I suppose it&#39;s even possible that there&#39;s a majority in the House for some very mild gun legislation. But in a body in which the majority party runs things, those other majorities aren&#39;t getting votes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is that there are multiple majorities on multiple issues at any one time in any legislative chamber. What parties do is structure things so that certain majorities are allowed to express themselves -- and others are suppressed (meaning that in those cases, the minority wins). That&#39;s fine; in fact, it&#39;s better than fine, since legislatures probably couldn&#39;t function very well without that kind of structure. But there&#39;s no reason to assume that the party majority is the only majority that matters, or that it&#39;s always inherently better (and more democratic) to allow the party to determine which majorities count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#39;s without getting into the more complex question of whether majorities should always win in a democracy. I&#39;m strongly convinced they shouldn&#39;t (a classic example is when an indifferent majority is opposed by an intense minority). But put that aside. Again: reforms which favor party leadership simply do not favor chamber majorities in all cases, at any rate. They favor the majority party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strict majority party rule is, to be sure, better than strict minority party rule. Or, even worse, the incredibly bizarre situation in which a minority of the minority party intimidates the bulk of that party into doing whatever they say, and then abuses chamber rules to dictate to the majority party some policy which in fact only a slim majority support. So, yes, given the situation, Harry Reid and the Democrats had no choice but to act, and the result is in fact better than what they were faced with. To say that it necessarily empowers majorities, however, is another question altogether.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/8709691322238444692/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/majorities.html#comment-form' title='17 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/8709691322238444692'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/8709691322238444692'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/majorities.html' title='Majorities'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>17</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-1616839837184417025</id><published>2013-11-25T08:03:00.002-06:00</published><updated>2013-11-25T08:03:51.459-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Iran"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Senate"/><title type='text'>Read Stuff, You Should</title><content type='html'>Happy Birthday to &lt;span id=&quot;goog_1970391799&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/&quot;&gt;Tim Armstrong&lt;span id=&quot;goog_1970391800&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 47. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of good stuff for a holiday week:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Four pieces -- Greg Koger, Barbara Sinclair, Aaron Belkin, and Richard Arenberg -- on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/11/22/a-change-in-rules-on-filibusters-and-its-impact-on-congress?hp&amp;amp;rref=opinion&quot;&gt;the post-nuclear Senate.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. &lt;a href=&quot;http://isps.yale.edu/news/blog/2013/11/the-senate-and-the-nuclear-option#.UpGRlsSsiSq&quot;&gt;Another one&lt;/a&gt;, from David Mayhew. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.

I suppose she&#39;s right that the Senate will never quite &quot;become the House&quot; -- something I&#39;m guilty of saying. However, I do think the risk (or, if you like it, the promise) of it coming close enough is sufficient that it&#39;s only a misdemeanor, not a felony, to use it as a shorthand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Mark Goldberg on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.undispatch.com/3-reasons-why-this-iran-breakthrough-is-a-very-big-deal&quot;&gt;the Iran deal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.

Kevin Drum makes the key point that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/11/obamacare-has-friend-health-care-industry&quot;&gt;the entire health care industry, basically, is already committed to ACA&lt;/a&gt; (because they had to be), which means that it ain&#39;t gonna disappear. Which matches the point that I&#39;ve been making: repeal of ACA is long dead because the status quo ante no longer exists; whatever happens will be building on ACA, not starting over. </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/1616839837184417025/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/read-stuff-you-should_25.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/1616839837184417025'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/1616839837184417025'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/read-stuff-you-should_25.html' title='Read Stuff, You Should'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-4898991323488844317</id><published>2013-11-24T15:27:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2013-11-24T15:27:48.940-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Senate"/><title type='text'>Sunday Question for Liberals </title><content type='html'>Same question, pushing &amp;nbsp;on my Saturday Salon &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salon.com/2013/11/23/why_we_should_save_the_filibuster/&quot;&gt;column&lt;/a&gt;, in which I argued that the filibuster can still be saved.

The 38 and 39 year old seasons of a fringe-HOF type pitcher who has aged pretty well? Yeah, I&#39;ll take that. Sure, he could easily go south, but the odds of 50-55 league-average starts over the two years seem reasonable high to me. There were a couple of guys out there I was worried fit the Sabean profile who I was a lot less confident in, so I&#39;m smiling about this. Given that I&#39;m also a Freak optimist at this point, I&#39;m happy with Sabean. Of course, he hasn&#39;t dealt with the 1B/LF hole yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hudson has really had bad luck with money over his career. I mean, for a player at his level, over the same years; obviously, if you&#39;re a HOF-level pitcher, you&#39;re going to be lucky financially if you debut in 1999 and not 1979 or 1959. Still, he&#39;s just shy of $100M total salaries going into the $25M over the next two years he&#39;ll get from the Giants. Doesn&#39;t that seem below par for a guy with his career? His #1 most-similar at baseball-reference is Kevin Brown (debut 1989), and he&#39;s running just about even with Brown&#39;s salary take through their 39 year old seasons (assuming we can count on Hudson pulling in the money on the contract he just signed). He&#39;s behind Andy Pettitte, too, and behind Mike Mussina. Age here means a lot, but Hudson hasn&#39;t benefited from it. I mean, Roy Oswalt has made $97M so far, and he&#39;s younger than Hudson and not even remotely as good. Mark Buehrle, too. And then there&#39;s Hudson&#39;s old A&#39;s teammate, but we don&#39;t want to talk about him, do we?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At far as his chances of getting to the real HOF, it seems pretty unlikely; his HOF Monitor number is a very unimpressive 59. His chances (assuming no sabermetric revolution) basically depend on a revival that get him at least to 250 wins from his current 205 (plausible!). 300 doesn&#39;t appear possible; he would probably have to stay a rotation starter until he&#39;s 45 or 46, and he sure doesn&#39;t appear to have the stuff to do that. If he does get to 250, though, and maybe tacks on some impressive postseason stuff...well, then he&#39;s going to have a lot of sabermetric support, and he&#39;ll be a bubble guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think he&#39;ll be fun to root for.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/8109745281299465563/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/friday-baseball-post_23.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/8109745281299465563'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/8109745281299465563'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/friday-baseball-post_23.html' title='Friday Baseball Post'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-119278058324924754</id><published>2013-11-22T13:35:00.003-06:00</published><updated>2013-11-22T13:35:57.488-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="judicial nominations"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Senate"/><title type='text'>Post-Nuclear Etc.</title><content type='html'>Just a few notes to add to what I said elsewhere, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/11/21/did-frustrated-mainstream-republicans-help-pull-the-trigger/?clsrd&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for what the GOP was up to and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/11/22/power-the-senate-and-the-republican-control-grab/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for something about power and control in the Senate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I think the certainty among many liberals that Republicans would rapidly go nuclear as soon as they had unified control of the Senate and the White House is at best unproven. After all, they didn&#39;t do it when they had the opportunity during the George W. Bush years. If Democrats ratcheted down to Bush-level selective filibusters...maybe yes, maybe no. It may be true that the next GOP Senate would be more radical-influenced than the last ones, but then again they would still need the votes; if they only have 51 or 52, it&#39;s not very likely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Conservatives who think that Bush-era filibusters were on a par with Obama-era filibusters...just stop it. It&#39;s not a serious argument. Obama has faced a true 60 vote Senate, which means that virtually everything has been filibustered (yes, even those judges who were approved by voice vote with no cloture vote only got there because they had secured 60 votes, and that&#39;s a filibuster. Or at least it was). That&#39;s new. The blockades-by-filibuster are essentially new, too. It&#39;s a little more complicated...there have been blockades before, but they&#39;re usually by a Senate majority, or at the end of a president&#39;s term, or both. Nothing like this one. The escalation is more severe on the exec branch nomination side, but it&#39;s still very large on the judicial side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* And that&#39;s without even getting into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/obama-filibuster-liberal-judges&quot;&gt;the blue-slip situation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Just to be clear: yes, Democrats definitely ratcheted up judicial nomination filibusters during the George W. Bush presidency. Democrats also bear responsibility for ratcheting up opposition to executive branch nominations, with the Tower nomination a major turning point. Democrats, however, were willing to cut a deal to back down from the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Some liberals are urging Obama to now appoint very liberal judges. If he does that, it will risk defeat the old-fashioned way, by building a coalition of all Republicans and a handful of moderate Democrats. So far, Obama has stuck to mainstream judges, and that&#39;s meant he&#39;s retained just about every Senate Democrat on almost every confirmation vote (I don&#39;t actually remember any defections, but I assume there have been a few over the years). That&#39;s not to say Obama shouldn&#39;t do it. Just that there are costs and benefits that are not always easy to calculate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, that&#39;s all for now, but I suspect I&#39;ll have more points later.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/119278058324924754/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/post-nuclear-etc.html#comment-form' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/119278058324924754'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/119278058324924754'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/post-nuclear-etc.html' title='Post-Nuclear Etc.'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-4609659754245065900</id><published>2013-11-22T07:53:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2013-11-22T07:53:40.628-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Senate"/><title type='text'>Read Stuff, You Should</title><content type='html'>Happy Birthday to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000416/&quot;&gt;Terry Gilliam&lt;/a&gt;, 73.

Interesting. What I really am looking for, however, is a good analysis of the various players on the US side in the US/Afghanistan negotiations on post-2014, and who wants what and why. My general sense of it is that Barack Obama probably should just want out, and that the (apparent) effort to stay indicates that he&#39;s getting rolled by...I don&#39;t know. But this is just wild guessing on my part, and I could just as easily imagine that Obama wants to stay, and, say, the Pentagon wants out. At any rate, I haven&#39;t seen any analysis at all, and I&#39;d like to.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/4609659754245065900/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/read-stuff-you-should_22.html#comment-form' title='12 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/4609659754245065900'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/4609659754245065900'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/read-stuff-you-should_22.html' title='Read Stuff, You Should'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>12</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-8712658225723605091</id><published>2013-11-21T13:13:00.001-06:00</published><updated>2013-11-21T13:13:36.018-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Senate"/><title type='text'>Quick Post-Nuclear Fizzle</title><content type='html'>The Senate has gone nuclear. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/11/21/the-senate-has-gone-nuclear-heres-whats-next/&quot;&gt;first notes&lt;/a&gt; are up, over at Plum Line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have more on this, but one quick note. Soon after the key vote, Harry Reid asked for, and received, unanimous consent for committees to meet. That&#39;s normally a routine request. The fact that it remains a routine request, even immediately after the Democrats acted, is a quick answer to one question: no, Republicans will not &quot;blow up&quot; the Senate to retaliate for majority-imposed reform. I suppose it&#39;s possible that they&#39;ll regroup and change their minds, but much more likely will be some sort of&amp;nbsp; minor &quot;blow up&quot; demonstration, nothing more. McConnell didn&#39;t really even make a lot of threats about it, at least not today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, my prediction of a GOP surrender (well, I made odds on it, so not exactly a prediction) didn&#39;t work out so well, but this is one that it looks like I &lt;a href=&quot;http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/05/anticipating-nuclear-fallout.html&quot;&gt;was right&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll also say that I don&#39;t really believe that today&#39;s action is going to matter at all in terms of bipartisan bargaining in the future.

On the other hand? They&#39;re apparently nowhere close to being ready to pay subsidies to insurance companies. But delaying that will just be costly; the 834s could be a system-destroying disaster.

I (more or less) disagree, but the more practical issue here isn&#39;t really about whether filibusters are good for democracy or liberals or conservatives; it&#39;s that they&#39;re good for individual Senators, and (again, like it or not) they&#39;re going to be reluctant to surrender them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.

They don&#39;t want an outcome with no filibusters, because they want to preserve their position when they are in the minority; but they also don&#39;t want more frequent filibusters.* As Republicans push farther and farther from the Democratic ideal point, total elimination of the filibuster becomes a more and more appealing second-best end point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blockading three DC Appeals Court seats is, I&#39;ve thought from the beginning, far beyond that line. Thus &quot;no choice.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, we still don&#39;t know exactly why the Republicans are where they are. They may want Democrats to eliminate the filibuster; in that case, that&#39;s what we&#39;ll get. On the other hand, it could merely be a breakdown in the tag-team voting they&#39;ve used since the summer confrontation to get cloture on nominations, with different sets of at least five (previously six) Republicans voting yes. If that&#39;s the case, then it may just mean that the dozen or so tag teamers will get together and figure out who has to cast the three additional votes needed on these judicial nominees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If however, Republicans mistakenly thought that they could roll the Democrats on this but don&#39;t want majority-imposed reform (which, after all, would leave them unable to stop any future nominees), then they&#39;ll need to back down, and the question becomes how far. Perhaps they could get a deal in which they only blockade one seat. More likely, they would have to give up the blockade and agree to allow final votes on at least two of the current nominees and a replacement for the other (assuming they want to take their chances with another selection).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Tweeter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Mansfield2016/status/402927822798196736&quot;&gt;Mansfield 2016&lt;/a&gt; reminds us that Democrats want new additional judicial seats, and suggests that could be part of a deal. That&#39;s a deal that I think Democrats should be happy to take, but one which Senate Republican dealmakers, unfortunately, can&#39;t deliver on because it would require House Republicans to go along. It&#39;s worth remember, however, that part of the reason that the DC Circuit&#39;s caseload is comparatively low is that Congress has failed for many years now to add seats elsewhere on the federal bench).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as I&#39;m here, I should mention two arguments I&#39;ve made in the past that are relevant to this showdown. One is that I don&#39;t think the Democrats will push ahead with a bare majority of 50 plus Joe Biden; I think they won&#39;t do it without at least 52. I do think they&#39;ll have the votes (as Jennifer Bendery&#39;s reporting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/19/senate-filibuster-reform_n_4304091.html?1384890572&quot;&gt;confirms&lt;/a&gt;) -- in fact, I suspect they&#39;ll have 54 of 55, everyone but Levin. But some of the less enthusiastic may only be along for part of the ride; indeed, it&#39;s even possible that some of them might just be bluffing, and that Harry Reid knows he can&#39;t count on them. That&#39;s possible, but I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s true at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other one is that I really don&#39;t give much weight to minority-party threats that they&#39;ll shut the Senate down after majority-imposed reform. I expect maybe a few display of outrage, but that they&#39;ll fizzle out rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, it sure looks like we&#39;ll know more very soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It&#39;s actually more complicated. They may be indifferent about judicial filibusters, but want to preserve other filibusters -- and believe that majority-imposed reform on one would lead eventually to elimination of all filibusters. But that doesn&#39;t really change the situation described here.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/3663392709344839527/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/filibuster-showdown-update.html#comment-form' title='10 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/3663392709344839527'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/3663392709344839527'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/filibuster-showdown-update.html' title='Filibuster Showdown Update'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>10</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-572884662566292648</id><published>2013-11-19T10:41:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2013-11-19T10:41:08.896-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="politicians"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Presidential nomination process"/><title type='text'>Catch of the Day</title><content type='html'>I think this properly should go to Noam Scheiber, although he cites another &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/11/hillary-clinton-vs-elizabeth-warren.html&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/noamscheiber/status/402472367428882432&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s why it doesn&#39;t matter if Warren or her fundraisers say she&#39;s not running in 16: she cant possibly know herself&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;We can refine this a bit, I suppose. She certainly might know if she&#39;s running right now, even though she wouldn&#39;t know whether she&#39;ll still be running by the Iowa caucuses. And she might want to deny running, even if that&#39;s the case. She also might have some reason to be absolutely certain that she would never run, even if the thing dropped in her lap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for many candidates at this stage, it&#39;s more ambiguous, and the particular structure on the Democratic side in this cycle makes it even more so. Presumably there are several potential candidates who are in if Hillary Clinton drops out, but out if she remains in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Clinton, as many of us have noted, it makes sense to delay the overt candidacy as long as possible; not only does that leave all her options open if she&#39;s really undecided, but even if she is clearly running for now there&#39;s nothing much to be gained by becoming an overt candidate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, for Warren or Clinton or whoever, making the move from &quot;doing everything one would need to do to be in a position to being an active candidate in the months leading up to Iowa&quot; to an overt candidacy may very well depend on how the first part of things goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is to say that for actual politicians going through the process, the decision isn&#39;t so much of a &quot;if you could be president would you do it&quot; or even a &quot;if you could be the nominee would you do it&quot; as much as it is &quot;considering the chances of winning both the nomination and the general election, which are constantly shifting, is it worth continuing to move forward?&quot; Which leaves two potentially moving variables: the point at which the politician believes it&#39;s worth making the run, and the assessment by the candidate of how close she is to that point. What I mean is that some potential candidate (say, Elizabeth Warren) might definitely be up for being president if it was handed to her and definitely wouldn&#39;t run if it was a sure loss without having definitively decided exactly what her perceived chances would have to be for her to be an active candidate in 2016. So deciding whether to run really means figuring out both the odds of winning that make it worth running, and what the current odds of winning might be -- which includes both the overall emerging political context and, as time goes on, what&#39;s happening in her own not-quite-a-campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combine all that with some legal and some practical political reasons for candidates to avoid overt candidacies until fairly late in the process -- along with a system in which contesting the nomination actually begins (at least) three years before Iowa. So we have good reason to heavily discount whatever they say about their (current? possible?) candidacies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, in real life, we don&#39;t really have two separate piles of candidates and non-candidates; we get a whole bunch of people who are in between. Especially in the first two years of the cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words? A very good shorthand for all of that is &quot;she can&#39;t possibly know herself.&quot; So: nice catch!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/572884662566292648/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/catch-of-day_19.html#comment-form' title='10 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/572884662566292648'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/572884662566292648'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/catch-of-day_19.html' title='Catch of the Day'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>10</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-5980972088346860618</id><published>2013-11-19T08:11:00.002-06:00</published><updated>2013-11-19T08:11:50.051-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="campaign finance"/><title type='text'>Read Stuff, You Should</title><content type='html'>Happy Birthday to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000395/&quot;&gt;Terry Farrell&lt;/a&gt;, 50.

Or at least, be very careful about subsamples. Kraushaar published this one early today, before last week&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gallup.com/poll/124922/Presidential-Approval-Center.aspx&quot;&gt;Gallup numbers&lt;/a&gt; were ready; turns out that Obama&#39;s approval among Hispanics, per Gallup, is now at 52% -- up three points over two weeks ago, while the overall rate remained stuck at 41%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or whatever. These kinds of subsamples can be all over the place. As it happens, I had noticed the falloff too...and I had been planning to write this item if it turned around, which it more or less has, even before Kraushaar gave me the additional hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Oh, and yes -- the press frenzy of the last two weeks is accompanied by a zero-point decline in approval; Obama is down 2 points overall since the last full week of September, which is the last week before the rollout of the exchanges and the shutdown. Two percentage points. Free fall!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#39;s the difference between Obama&#39;s overall approval rating and his rating among Hispanics, going back over time, with this week at 52% overall - 41% Hispanic = 11 points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11, 9, 8, 15, 13, 10, 14, 10, 16, 14, 16, 15, 18, 18, 17, 20, 18, 17, 18, 18, 19, 19, 20, 15, 20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back further, it&#39;s around 20 to the beginning of the year, which is as much as Gallup has posted now. So...it does appear that there has probably been a change over time. But the decline started a while ago; that last 20 point gap is at the end of July, and the gap was down to 10 points at the end of September -- before the exchanges, and before the shutdown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to guess, it would be that it&#39;s more about immigration disappearing from the news agenda; as budget and health care dominated the news, Latino voters reacted more or less the same as everyone else. But that&#39;s a guess! It&#39;s impossible to really get any closer to the truth from these numbers. Other than it&#39;s unlikely -- not impossible, but unlikely -- that it&#39;s reflecting something about the ACA rollout. The sequence just doesn&#39;t seem to suggest that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The general point: be very, very, very, very wary about using the subsamples in these kinds of polls. It&#39;s incredibly easy to get big jumps that are really just random noise -- look, for example, at the 20-15-20 sequence right at the end there. The odds of getting all worked up over something that isn&#39;t real are, unfortunately, very high.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/8562999384297574371/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/ignore-those-polls-small-sample-size.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/8562999384297574371'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/8562999384297574371'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/ignore-those-polls-small-sample-size.html' title='Ignore Those Polls!

Anyway, here are some links to what I&#39;ve written in response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s just a lot of nonsense right now.

As I &lt;a href=&quot;http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/ive-seen-this-one-before.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; last week...no, it really isn&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and then there&#39;s the &quot;doom for liberalism&quot; argument. On Friday, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/11/15/the-consequences-of-an-affordable-care-act-failure/&quot;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that public opinion doesn&#39;t work that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll dredge up a couple of other relevant posts from a while back. At the beginning of the month, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/11/01/the-gop-push-for-obamacare-repeal-is-dead/&quot;&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that &quot;repeal&quot; really is dead; the status quo ante has been disrupted far too much to ever return to it. Whatever happens in the future, it will be building on the new, ACA status quo, not repealing it and returning to the past arrangements. And I&#39;ve also been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/11/06/ignore-the-spin-war-about-obamacare-its-irrelevant-rinse-repeat/&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; that the spin at this point is irrelevant; what matters is whether the law works.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/184107678836564242/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/obamacare-press-frenzy-stuff.html#comment-form' title='23 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/184107678836564242'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/184107678836564242'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/obamacare-press-frenzy-stuff.html' title='Obamacare Press Frenzy Stuff'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>23</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-8006280266060890998</id><published>2013-11-18T07:59:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2013-11-18T07:59:19.553-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Federal Reserve"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="voting"/><title type='text'>Read Stuff, You Should</title><content type='html'>Happy Birthday to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/moyerja01.shtml&quot;&gt;Jamie Moyer&lt;/a&gt;, 51. I&#39;m obviously not alone in this, but he was my guy: the last player older than me in the majors. Or anywhere in organized ball, as far as I know. Ah well. My cohort was obviously pretty lucky in that respect. A wonderful career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. As one who agrees with the courts that partisan gerrymandering is kosher by the Constitution, I nevertheless agree very much with Rick Hasen about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/16/opinion/voter-suppressions-new-pretext.html?smid=tw-share&amp;amp;_r=0&quot;&gt;voter suppression and the Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. That is, courts &quot;should hold that when a state passes a law that burdens voters, it must demonstrate, with credible evidence, that the burdens are justified by a good reason and that the laws are tailored to their intended purpose.&quot; Actually, that doesn&#39;t even seem strong enough to me, but it&#39;s a good start. Voting should be easy, full stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Peter Ubertaccio on why Barack Obama &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.masspoliticsprofs.com/2013/11/17/the-presidents-neustadtian-nightmare/&quot;&gt;can&#39;t really do much about public opinion&lt;/a&gt;. I wouldn&#39;t have called it a nightmare, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. John Sides has an interview with Julio Saurez about his new research on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2013/11/15/democratic-and-republican-appointees-to-the-federal-reserve-arent-that-different-after-all/&quot;&gt;Fed ideology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.

I&#39;m certainly not any less of a baseball fan than I used to be. I&#39;m just as interested as ever in the HOF, which one would think would be similar. But the postseason awards? If one of the Giants has a shot at it, I&#39;ll root for him, and otherwise...well, I&#39;ll notice them. I might read a couple of items. That&#39;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to vote at the Internet Baseball Awards (I used to vote back when they were conducted over USENET, actually). I don&#39;t, any more. Don&#39;t even check to see who won most years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what is it? Is it associated with age? Anyone else lose interest in the postseason awards as they got older? I mean, I&#39;m not &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; old. Anyone find themselves more interested now than they used to be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best guess is that -- and you&#39;re going to think this is silly -- a big part of it for me might have to do with how they changed the way the awards rolled out. Not that the new style is worse. Just that it&#39;s different, and that lost some of the fun of it for me. I mean, part of the reason that the postseason awards &quot;count&quot; is because we all believe in them, even those of us who believe in them as a thing to knock down. And one reason I think I believe in them was because they always showed up on the same schedule, slowly, after the World Series. Once they started messing with the schedule, and lately with the rest of the presentation, it just changed it for me. Yes, it&#39;s silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other possibilities. For years, I was involved in regular baseball conversation (usenet, and then I was on one or another mailing list for a long time)...I don&#39;t really have an ongoing baseball conversation to capture my attention about whatever&#39;s going on. But it&#39;s not as if those conversations aren&#39;t available to me, or that I don&#39;t remain interested in other baseball topics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, who knows, plenty of possibilities. I am curious about whether it&#39;s me that&#39;s changed or the awards. Who knows: maybe I&#39;ll wind up totally into them next year. But for now, not so much.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/6069920600955779506/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/friday-baseball-post.html#comment-form' title='10 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/6069920600955779506'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/6069920600955779506'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/friday-baseball-post.html' title='Friday Baseball Post'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>10</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-7014536991896800372</id><published>2013-11-15T09:32:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2013-11-15T09:32:29.925-06:00</updated><title type='text'>I&#39;ve Seen This One Before</title><content type='html'>Today the House is scheduled to vote for the Upton bill, at least unless conservatives decide at the last minute that it really is a fix, and therefore helping Obamacare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Democrats will vote for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick hint: House Democratic votes for Upton, in a situation in which the bill won&#39;t be coming to the Senate floor, may be an indication that Republicans have successfully crafted a bill that puts pressure on Democrats to split their votes. But it&#39;s not an indication that Democrats are abandoning the ACA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This happened just a month ago, when Republicans during the shutdown brought up a series of mini-CRs and successfully peeled off some Democrats on those, too. Some Republicans convinced themselves at the time that this was an indication that Democrats were splitting, and that Republicans were going to win the shutdown. We know how that turned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether it&#39;s a deliberate leadership strategy or not, House Democrats worried about re-election appear perfectly willing to defect on symbolic votes set up by Republicans to make political points. Nancy Pelosi and the leadership are either unable to prevent it, or -- more likely -- don&#39;t care and don&#39;t try to prevent it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Yuval Levin &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/364038/president-losing-his-plan-yuval-levin&quot;&gt;predicts&lt;/a&gt; that Democrats who vote for Upton &quot;might well never come back to the Obamacare fold,&quot; don&#39;t believe it. There&#39;s an enormous difference between playing along on a symbolic vote and abandoning a policy Democrats are stuck with, like it or not. And the truth is: most of them almost certainly do like it. What&#39;s more, as long as there&#39;s no plausible alternative that could work better for them, they really, at the end of the day, have little choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, whatever the chances are that they eventually bail on ACA, this vote isn&#39;t about that. Just as symbolic votes during the shutdown didn&#39;t indicated that Democrats were divided (or, for that matter, that Republicans were unified). If Republicans do make that mistake again...well, at least they&#39;ll be consistent. </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/7014536991896800372/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/ive-seen-this-one-before.html#comment-form' title='9 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/7014536991896800372'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/7014536991896800372'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/ive-seen-this-one-before.html' title='I&#39;ve Seen This One Before'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>9</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-7651741619771818985</id><published>2013-11-15T08:30:00.001-06:00</published><updated>2013-11-15T08:30:39.647-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="voting"/><title type='text'>Read Stuff, You Should</title><content type='html'>Happy Birthday to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001538/&quot;&gt;Jonny Lee Miller&lt;/a&gt;, 41.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some good stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I didn&#39;t know &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.ft.com/the-world/2013/11/the-new-fashion-for-national-security-councils/&quot;&gt;the Brits had set up a US-like National Security Council&lt;/a&gt;, and that other nations were getting in on it. Gideon Rachman explains. I assume, of course, that the big problem in the UK is coordinating the efforts of the Ministry of Administrative Affairs with what&#39;s going on over at Silly Walks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2013/11/ageless_pressler_eyes_historic.php&quot;&gt;Larry Pressler is (sort of) back!&lt;/a&gt; Eric Ostermeier is all over the election, and the distinction he would hold if he (improbably) wins back a Senate seat. Pressler, last seen when defeated in 1996, would be, yes, &lt;a href=&quot;http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2011/03/buddy-roemer-captain-bateson-class.html&quot;&gt;a Bateson class Senate candidate&lt;/a&gt;. I really want that to catch on; perhaps the low odds of it happening have something to do with how I have to look it up every time I mention it to remember the Kelsey Grammer character name. But still: Bateson class candidates. Use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. More evidence that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2013/11/14/about-as-many-people-say-theyve-been-abducted-by-space-aliens-as-say-theyve-committed-voter-fraud/&quot;&gt;voter impersonation -- you know, the &quot;reason&quot; for voter ID -- just doesn&#39;t exist&lt;/a&gt;.

I &lt;a href=&quot;http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2010/02/impeachment-update.html&quot;&gt;thought&lt;/a&gt; someone would formally introduce articles of impeachment against Barack Obama long ago. Not that they would actually go ahead an impeach him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note that my prediction wasn&#39;t just &quot;someone&quot; -- I picked Michele Bachmann. Which, granted, wasn&#39;t really a wild stretch, but it turns out she&#39;s one of the group gunning for Holder. So I&#39;m not entirely, totally wrong. Just missed the target. And the date, by three years. And they&#39;re not even picking a symbolic date, at least as far as I know. And she&#39;s apparently not even the lead on it. So, really, well, that&#39;s pretty bad predicting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, as predictions go, this one wasn&#39;t entirely, well, scientific. Just having a little fun.

Or maybe it helps to have read a little history. Or maybe I&#39;m just an old guy.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyway: we&#39;re at a point at which even Jonathan Chait, &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/11/congressional-democrats-freak-out-over-obamacare.html&quot;&gt;writing against panic&lt;/a&gt;, says that &quot;the current sense of dread enveloping the Democratic Party has a very real basis. President Obama’s poll numbers are plunging to unprecedented depths.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yes, it&#39;s all massively overstated.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Plunging? His approval (and some associated numbers) have definitely dropped. I suppose &quot;plunge&quot; is subjective, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/obama-job-approval#!&quot;&gt;HuffPollster&#39;s estimate&lt;/a&gt;, set for &quot;less smoothing&quot; and therefore (over?) sensitive to recent polls, is that he&#39;s lost maybe 2.5 percentage points over the last five or so weeks. He&#39;s been losing ground all year including, mostly likely, during the shutdown. Depending on what adjustments one does, that might have accelerated after the shutdown, or maybe not. It doesn&#39;t sound like a &quot;plunge&quot; to me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Obama&#39;s popularity is probably at the low point of his presidency (again, depending on the adjustments, he&#39;s either a bit below or a bit above his previous low. But it&#39;s not any kind of unusually low low point (he&#39;s nowhere near Truman, Carter, Nixon, W.), there&#39;s no particular reason to expect the slump to continue, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/11/12/lets-kill-off-this-myth-about-second-term-presidents/&quot;&gt;myths aside&lt;/a&gt; no reason to believe he won&#39;t recover if the news turns better. Granted, it&#39;s hard to know what to expect from healthcare.gov, but it&#39;s not as if it&#39;s getting worse over time. I&#39;m not saying his numbers will go up. Just that it&#39;s more or less equally likely as further drops.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(Actually...if I had to guess, I&#39;d say a run of either stability or improvement is probably more likely, at least if the next budget deadlines come and go quietly. Gallup&#39;s economic confidence index has been steadily recovering from its shutdown/debt limit plunge -- yes, that one was a real plunge -- and Jamelle Bouie is right that the economy is a very big part of presidential approval, although I think he somewhat understates the ability of other events to matter).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As for electoral effects? I wrote an item &lt;a href=&quot;http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/10/electoral-effects-of-shutdown.html&quot;&gt;dismissing direct electoral effects&lt;/a&gt; of the shutdown against Republicans back last month; that post pretty much works now, in reverse for effects against Democrats. I should say: it&#39;s far easier for sentiment against the president to translate into midterm electoral losses than it is for feelings against the out-party. So if Obama is unpopular in November 2014, it will hurt Democrats. But today&#39;s frenzy about the ACA is going to be mostly forgotten by then, one way or another, just as the shutdown seems forgotten today. That&#39;s probably even true, believe it or not, if the program totally collapses, although I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to happen.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyway, Obama&#39;s approval ratings have in fact fallen from the mid-40s to the low-40s, and over the course of the year from around 50 to the low 40s. It&#39;s obviously not good news for him, but it seems a lot less dramatic than a lot of the chatter this week would have it be.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/1097243040378952293/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/electoral-effects-of-theoh-cmon-people.html#comment-form' title='8 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/1097243040378952293'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/1097243040378952293'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/electoral-effects-of-theoh-cmon-people.html' title='Electoral Effects of the...Oh, C&#39;mon, People, Really?'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-7851687028143537644</id><published>2013-11-14T08:03:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2013-11-14T08:03:41.785-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="political behavior"/><title type='text'>Read Stuff, You Should</title><content type='html'>Happy Birthday to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000624/&quot;&gt;Laura San Giacomo&lt;/a&gt;, 51. Perhaps she doesn&#39;t want to do it, but otherwise difficult to understand why she&#39;s not starring on one of those TVLand sitcoms. Actually, how about a TVLand sitcom with her, Amy Yasbeck, Hector Elizondo, and Jason Alexander? Isn&#39;t that a totally plausible cast? And, yeah, I&#39;d watch it if it was on. It&#39;d be better than the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100405/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_41&quot;&gt;last thing&lt;/a&gt; they did together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to business: there&#39;s always good stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Good Aaron Blake analysis of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/11/13/are-tea-party-groups-more-interested-in-purity-or-poking-the-bear/&quot;&gt;what Tea Party and other radical Republican organizations look for &lt;/a&gt;when endorsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Nice back and forth this week about genetics and politics research. First, Larry Bartels argues that the research is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2013/11/12/your-genes-influence-your-political-views-so-what/&quot;&gt;unlikely to pass the &quot;so what?&quot; test&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Hans Noel &lt;a href=&quot;http://mischiefsoffaction.blogspot.com/2013/11/what-kind-of-genes-did-william-jennings.html&quot;&gt;follows up&lt;/a&gt; on that, and plugs his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Political-Ideologies-Parties-Cambridge-Psychology/dp/110762052X/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1384288570&amp;amp;sr=1-3&quot;&gt;new, upcoming, book&lt;/a&gt; (which, from what I know of his work, should be excellent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Some &lt;a href=&quot;http://prowag.me/2013/11/13/a-response-to-your-genes-influence-your-political-views-so-what/&quot;&gt;dissent&lt;/a&gt; from Mike Wagner. I&#39;m with Bartels in the skeptical camp (although I&#39;m not even remotely expert enough to discuss this stuff for real), but read both sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Not really related, but perhaps more interesting for those of you who aren&#39;t political scientists: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2013/11/13/no-good-looks-dont-win-elections/&quot;&gt;good looking candidates don&#39;t really have an electoral advantage&lt;/a&gt;.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/7851687028143537644/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/read-stuff-you-should_14.html#comment-form' title='13 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/7851687028143537644'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/7851687028143537644'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/read-stuff-you-should_14.html' title='Read Stuff, You Should'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>13</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-2051522512818443557</id><published>2013-11-13T16:33:00.001-06:00</published><updated>2013-11-13T16:33:11.260-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Congress"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="parties"/><title type='text'>Gridlock/Polarization</title><content type='html'>National Journal is running a funny-looking chart of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/this-is-what-congressional-gridlock-looks-like-in-1-chart-20131113&quot;&gt;partisan polarization in the House with this explanatio&lt;/a&gt;n:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;If you&#39;re looking for a quick fact to explain congressional gridlock, it&#39;s this: In the 113th Congress, only 59 members have voted with the majority of their party less than 90 percent of the time (20 Republicans and 39 Democrats).&lt;/blockquote&gt;So first of all, a minor point: &quot;Congress&quot; here apparently means the House.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second: polarization -- partisan polarization -- just means that Members vote with their party and against theother party. Gridlock is about failure to pass legislation. Indeed, really more specific; to go back to the traffic analogy, it&#39;s about failure to pass legislation that everyone wants, but is being blocked by collective action failure of some type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is to say that gridlock and polarization are not the same thing, and not necessarily related in any straightforward way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, within the House, partisan polarization should ease gridlock. Since the House runs by majority party, if that party is unified, then they can basically do whatever they want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus in the historic 111th Congress, in 2009-2010, the House was extremely productive. Very strong polarization, and no gridlock at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Senate, with the filibuster forcing supermajorities, is another story; there, polarization might make gridlock more likely assuming that the majority party has fewer than 60 Senators. However, with 60 Senators, and given unified government, polarization should mean less, not more, gridock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about with divided government? Does polarization then mean gridlock?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not necessarily. A non-polarized Congress can avoid gridlock by having different majorities express themselves on different issues. On the other hand, a non-polarized Congress also can create a lot more gridlock. After all, a polarized Congress means that one person can bargain for her whole party; a non-polarized Congress can devolve into an ungovernable mess (indeed, one theory of why parties exist at all is that legislatures don&#39;t really work well without them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, the relationship between polarization and gridlock is complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does cause gridlock, however, is a party driven by aversion to compromise -- both internally and with the other party. That&#39;s what&#39;s happening now, with the dysfunctional GOP. And that, not polarization, is most likely the primary source of current gridlock.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/2051522512818443557/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/gridlockpolarization.html#comment-form' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/2051522512818443557'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/2051522512818443557'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/gridlockpolarization.html' title='Gridlock/Polarization'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-7086765383266602778</id><published>2013-11-13T09:54:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2013-11-13T09:54:01.030-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Senate"/><title type='text'>What Are Republicans Thinking on Filibusters?</title><content type='html'>At this point in the current filibuster showdown, most of the focus is on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.rollcall.com/wgdb/democrats-nuclear-option-judges/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter&quot;&gt;what the Democrats will do&lt;/a&gt;, with Republicans blockading three seats on the DC Circuit Court. It seems to me that Democrats will have little choice but to threaten majority-imposed rules change and, if necessary, carry out that threat. But what are Republicans thinking? I have no idea, but there seem to be several possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. They don&#39;t believe Democrats will really go through with majority-imposed reform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. They&#39;re bluffing. They intend to fold at the last minute, just as they did over executive branch nominations during the last confrontation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. They&#39;re not bluffing, and they don&#39;t think the Democrats are bluffing -- they want to get rid of the filibuster, and want the Democrats to be the ones who do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Collectively, they want to back down. However, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/07/how-senate-deal-is-working.html&quot;&gt;tag-team method&lt;/a&gt; they&#39;ve been using to lose on cloture votes by relatively narrow margins have broken down; they can&#39;t find five Republicans to take the potential re-nomination hit of voting for cloture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or perhaps it&#39;s a mistake to suggest that &quot;the Republicans&quot; are thinking anything as a group. After all, these are 45 individual, autonomous politicians; there may be all sorts of mixed combinations of what&#39;s going on here. For example, it could be that 20 or so Republican Senators are in column #3 and want to get rid of the filibuster, and then another 20 or so are just afraid to vote against those first twenty...and then a few more are really just bluffing. Or are really reading the Democrats as bluffing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said: I have no idea what&#39;s going on here, and therefore what the likely end game might be. Perhaps we&#39;ll learn more as we move towards the third cloture vote.

The one thing worth adding, from the White House point of view: a rapidly decreasing deficit is &quot;objectively&quot; lower; whether it&#39;s an improvement is more complicated, though.

Short answer: holding hearings, doing research, planning on a January report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is all fine, and I have nothing against Bob Bauer and Ben Ginsberg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#39;ll stick to &lt;a href=&quot;http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/02/a-disappointing-voting-initiative.html&quot;&gt;what I said&lt;/a&gt; back in February: a presidential commission is the wrong way of going about this, and Bauer and Ginsberg are the wrong people to head it if the goal is to really change things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In particular: presidential commissions are excellent for one kind of situation: when everyone agrees on what should be done, but no one wants the credit (or blame). That&#39;s why I want a presidential commission dedicated to slashing vetting for executive branch nominations; presidents don&#39;t want to admit that the costs of allowing a few bad apples through are much lower than the costs associated with the current system, nor do they want to have their own reforms blamed when the inevitable bad apples show up. On top of that, presidents aren&#39;t likely to want to admit that there&#39;s nothing wrong with having some nominees who might, looked at in just the right angle, present an appearance of a conflict of interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Obama had presented a serious proposal back in February...well, it probably would have died, but perhaps it could have passed the Senate, and there&#39;s always a chance it could have been tossed in to whatever omnibus bill was going through. And I suppose it&#39;s still possible that the commission will produce something worthwhile and that Obama will push it hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a much more likely outcome is that we get a lowest common denominator report from the commission, avoiding anything that either party objects to, and after the story appears on page A17 that&#39;s the end of it until the same problems show up in 2014 and 2016. </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/427497557717828831/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/why-i-expect-nothing-out-of-bauer.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/427497557717828831'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/427497557717828831'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/why-i-expect-nothing-out-of-bauer.html' title='Why I Expect Nothing Out of Bauer-Ginsberg'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-6022404601524495301</id><published>2013-11-12T10:49:00.001-06:00</published><updated>2013-11-12T10:49:34.466-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="health care"/><title type='text'>Catch of the Day</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/11/12/the-morning-plum-white-house-braces-for-terrible-obamacare-enrollment-numbers/&quot;&gt;Greg Sargent&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(his emphasis)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Let’s face it, the spin war over initial low enrollment figures just doesn’t matter that much. Because the story here is the same as it always was: &lt;i&gt;All that matters is whether the policy works in the long run.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it does, then all of the spin of the moment — &lt;i&gt;low enrollment proves the law is in total collapse! Red state Dems are fleeing the wreckage wholesale&lt;/i&gt;! — will be forgotten entirely, and Republicans will have to readjust to a political landscape in which the law is working for lots and lots of people. If it doesn’t — if the website doesn’t work in the new year, or if enrollment figures remain too low over time, causing the exchanges to collapse – then all bets will be off anyway.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Yes, and yes. And he&#39;s also correct that the best play for the administration is to be as open about the statistics involved as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m mostly still sticking with what I said a while ago, which is that ultimately the web site problems won&#39;t destroy the program. They certainly could cause a lot of disruption, though; Brian Beutler &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salon.com/2013/11/12/gop_about_to_hurt_itself_again_new_ploy_to_kill_obamacare_will_blow_up/&quot;&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; that if it really is impossible to enroll at the same time that current plans are discontinued, then that&#39;s an enormous problem mostly separate from all the hype about &quot;keep your plan,&quot; and it&#39;s a problem with no real obvious solution. Other than, you know, to get the damn program working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, yes, as Sarah Kliff &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/11/12/its-not-quite-time-to-freak-out-over-obamacares-enrollment-number/&quot;&gt;says today&lt;/a&gt;, what&#39;s important is who signs up as much as it is how many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But regardless: the law is here, it&#39;s being implemented, half a million people have signed up for Medicaid, young adults are on their parents&#39; plans, the donut hole is disappearing and other Medicare benefits have begun, lifetime and yearly caps and rescissions are gone...all of that is going to be very, very, difficult to displace. So when Greg says -- and I agree -- what matters is whether ACA works or not, what it matters to is the next wave of reform and change. Repeal? No, we&#39;re never going back to the status quo ante. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spin over first-month signups, meanwhile, won&#39;t affect any of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice catch!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/6022404601524495301/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/catch-of-day_12.html#comment-form' title='8 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/6022404601524495301'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6926413038778731189/posts/default/6022404601524495301'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2013/11/catch-of-day_12.html' title='Catch of the Day'/><author><name>Jonathan Bernstein</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/15931039630306253241</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6926413038778731189.post-5903382074943108146</id><published>2013-11-12T09:20:00.003-06:00</published><updated>2013-11-12T09:20:54.720-06:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="voting"/><title type='text'>Plain Blogger Smackdown</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Over at Greg&#39;s place yesterday, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/11/11/u-s-elections-are-still-awful-we-should-fix-that/&quot;&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; the hook of Virginia&#39;s wild count in the AG election as an excuse to call for more attention to election administration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reid Wilson &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PostReid/status/400014048752062464&quot;&gt;liked it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Good point from @jbplainblog: States really aren&#39;t that good at administering elections&lt;/blockquote&gt;And then a backlash started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ElectProject/status/400017184107151360&quot;&gt;Michael McDonald&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;usually don&#39;t see errors from election night reporting &amp;gt;&amp;gt; cavass.

VA, so far, doing an EXCELLENT job of public canvass. (Voting machines a diff issue.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;I&#39;ll take the blame here.

It&#39;s a fair point that any election, no matter how well run, is going to look messy when it&#39;s basically tied after 2.2M votes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said: my intention wasn&#39;t to bash the people doing the work in Virginia, but an overall system of election administration that is neglected, underfunded, and overly partisan. Which it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so I think the intended argument of the post was just fine.
