Desperate Pursuit in Venice


   Book Description

   When New York Private Equity partner Kataryna Taylor pursues the
   acquisition of a successful Italian biomedical company, she falls in
   love with Luca Romano, a member of the existing shareholders. Kataryna
   and Luca engage in a sensual love affair, which includes erotic
   encounters neither one of them has experienced before with such
   intensity. But danger and a family drama wait around the corner for
   Kataryna and Luca when the CEO of the company, to be acquired by
   Kataryna's firm, pursues her romantically and becomes infatuated with
   her.

   While working on the important international acquisition transaction
   and deepening her relationship with Luca, Kataryna encounters love,
   obsession, danger and a stunning family secret, which she is determined
   to resolve.

    An exciting and emotionally touching, sophisticated erotic page-turner
   played against the backdrop of Milan, Lake Como, and Venice, Italy, New
   York, Berlin and other locations, which will keep you in suspense and
   highly entertained.
