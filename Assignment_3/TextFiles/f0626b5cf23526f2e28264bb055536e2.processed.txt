     There are roughly three New Yorks. There is, first, the New York of
     the man or woman who was born there, who takes the city for granted
     and accepts its size, its turbulence as natural and inevitable.
     Second, there is the New York of the commuter—the city that is
     devoured by locusts each day and spat out each night. Third, there
     is New York of the person who was born somewhere else and came to
     New York in quest of something. Of these trembling cities the
     greatest is the last—the city of final destination, the city that is
     a goal. It is this third city that accounts for New York’s high
     strung disposition, its poetical deportment, its dedication to the
     arts, and its incomparable achievements. Commuters give the city its
     tidal restlessness, natives give it solidity and continuity, but the
     settlers give it passion. And whether it is a farmer arriving from a
     small town in Mississippi to escape the indignity of being observed
     by her neighbors, or a boy arriving from the Corn Belt with a
     manuscript in his suitcase and a pain in his heart, it makes no
     difference: each embraces New York with the intense excitement of
     first love, each absorbs New York with the fresh yes of an
     adventurer, each generates heat and light to dwarf the Consolidated
     Edison Company… — E.B. White, ‘Here is New York’

            with a god awful mash up that sounds like it was done by a

            how to get it on there. i'm really annoyed about this and even

            you all so much for listening and for the sweetest comments!

            in charge of music. So we're celebrating the release of iOS

            with a god awful mash up that sounds like it was done by a
